Plastic Memories, we should create new memories with people, all while recalling the past. Tsukasa Mizugaki a recent high school graduate, after failing his college exam Mizugaki has settled for a job at Sion Artificial Intelligence Corporation for sort ‘SAI Corp’. They are responsible for the creation of ‘Giftias’ which are incredibly advance androids practically humans with the amount of emotions and memories they retain and display. Although, unlike humans they have a maximum lifespan of --,--- hours which is the equivalent of - years and - months. Tsukasa is assigned to a department one and is partnered up with a veteran Giftias known as Isla. Their job is collect Giftias which are due for retirement since their time is coming to an end, if they don’t manage they can go a rampage or malfunction.  
Their first case is one with an older lady Chizu Shirohana with a Giftia known as Nina. A caretaking Giftia that does all the chores, caretaking, and providing for Chizu. Tsukasa being a beginner his approach is to sell and convince Chizu to allow them to take Nina away from and replace her with a new Giftia or erase her current ones memory bank. Chizu is persistent not wanting any part of this, always locking the door at the sight of Isla and Tsukasa. It’s until Isla confronts and meets Nina that they have a small conversation, and convinces Chizu to hear them out. Nina knows her time is coming to end, she’s frighten but her concerns like more with the well-being of Chizu, she overhears the conversation between Isla and Nina and is convinced she should let Nina go. It’s not until they when they say their final goodbyes that Tsukasa finds out the difficulty of this job and why this job gets a few cases because of the difficulty it can be to get them and convince the owner of the Giftia to give them up. 
Tsukasa Miguzaki is a sympathy caring guy when it comes Isla and his coworkers Michiru Kinushima and Zack. Although, Tsukasa does fall into the generic trope in protagonist where girls fall head over heels for him for not much of an apparent reason. Isla on the other hand is clumsy, quiet, keeps to herself kind of girl but when it comes can be out spoken and very confrontational. The way she communicates with Tsukasa is through her journal that how she conveys her thoughts and past experiences. Not much else can be said about Michiru other than she hides her true intentions with her aggressive Tsundere behavior and her partner Zack is a know it all. 
When it comes to the animation the vibrant colors convoy the feelings for the anime which can vary the instant a different tone shifts. The character’s designs are splendid to look at even matching the character’s architype at times, Michiru orange for being a labeled as hot head at times. However, being as distinct as they're you should be able to latch a name to every one of them instantly. The opening and ending sequences aren’t anything you glamorous with not much meaning just the characters posing with nicely animated backgrounds. However, I do appreciate the small detail of the Opening sequence near the end where Isla face changes after every episode OP conveying the tone of the episode. 
Plastic Memories gives of a strong impression want to forgo a strong narrative story which it does to a certain extent with Tsukasa and Isla being the main pair of the series. Tsukasa being thrown into the world of Giftias how they function, interact, and even live among society to eventually what becomes of then after their time limit is over. It does carry eye-rolling tropes that don’t necessarily take away from the anime but would have been better off if it went on a more serious tone. It would have benefited more if the removal of Giftias from their owner was more focal point.  It’s heavy hitting moments is what made sitting through, worth it. Plastic Memories is a small delightful anime that anyone that has time to spare or wants to feel their heart sink down their stomach to small funny light-hearted moment, should take a moment to watch.

Satoshi Kon’s final work Paprika is a colourful, energetic and surreal trip. It’s a film that asks us ‘what is reality?’ and for the most part does a great job of exploring the relationship between dreams and the real world. Filled to the brim with remarkable visuals from Madhouse, a good level of story complexity and even some commentary on the topic of cinema itself, it’s a big love letter to industry. While Paprika is a visual feast and directed with great attention to detail, it’s a shame that the story sacrifices clarity for surrealism at moments when questions need to be answered. The story contains a mix of ideas touching on ethics, discovering one’s purpose and what defines reality. Some of these ideas get ditched and others explored in greater detail, but the end result is still a very memorable film. 
Our story follows Atsuko Chiba who uses newly created technology without permission, which allows people to share dreams, to help patients with stress in the form of an alter ego Paprika. Trouble starts when versions of the device with no security fall into the wrong hands. This would allow the culprit to enter the dreams of others and cause untold amounts of deeply rooted psychological damage, even enough to destroy one’s psyche.  
I found myself actually drawn more towards the story of detective Toshimi Konakawa and his attempt to understand why his dreams are affecting him deeply at a psychological level. He is without a doubt the most deeply explored character, as one of Chiba’s patients. His attempt to overcome the unsolved case at his job is starting to toy with his mind and his past becomes caught up in these thoughts. Every time his dream came to the fore I was captivated. I thought the payoff for his journey was slightly underwhelming. Yet at the same time I knew the ending was only appropriate things take the direction they do considering the themes of the film - hiding our true feelings and creating a new reality so we don’t have to face the other one. 
It’s only appropriate that our main character Chiba be the one to best represent the idea of discovering one’s true self. While the film initially posits Paprika as a façade for her to treat others you start to question whether her fake persona is actually a better representation of her true self – someone more free spirited and approachable. While the internal struggle isn’t as plainly laid out for the viewer to see compared to Konakawa, it’s definitely there. Kon’s clever direction goes a long way to achieving this. From the repetitious use of glass to mirror Chiba’s other side of herself or the almost unnoticeable cut between reality and dreamscapes, it all works. Chiba herself isn’t actually that interesting of a character at face level, though that’s quite intentional. She has a cold demeanour, exuding this barrier of defence around herself. Paprika acts as a means to express her repressed emotions. As a collective, the two more are complete and fulfil what the other lacks. 
On my main criticism: Paprika as a film does little to explain the boundaries and the rules of its world and instead lets the film play out as an ‘experience’. Even the exposition of the movie isn’t clear at first. Though this lends to being entertaining it hinders the exploration of its themes. Something being intentionally difficult to understand without giving us an explanation doesn’t instantly make something amazing, it can be infuriating. While I actually like the idea of figuring things out for yourself and applying your own interpretation to things, there’s some cases where we need boundaries explained. This is one of those cases, in a film blending technology and the subconscious. The film’s ending actually starts to go against our understanding of reality and I just took it as one of those things I’ll have to accept. It actually reaches a point of absurdity that took me out of the experience. On top of this, the antagonist isn’t that interesting and gives the grand finale an underwhelming amount of impact.  
On the topic of visuals, a much more positive point, I rarely see animation so good that I actually find myself saying ‘wow’ as I’m watching it. There are so many moments full of warped transitions, literal world-bending scenes that are breathtaking. Kon loves flow between scenes. His scene transition here was at master-level. It keeps the film dynamic and does a great job of keeping you engaged. The opening credits scene in particular is one of the most memorable moments which showcase this fluidity to Kon’s direction. If you’re also looking for a movie that utilises repetition well then this is the one for you. It allows to see several things, such as how far our characters have overcome their psychological problems or seeing things in our dreams that makes us reflect upon reality.  
Paprika is a must watch. Story-wise it may get a bit too big for its own boots but it’s the perfect example of the journey sometimes being worth more than the destination.

I really don't like thrashing an anime because I'm not one of those immature people who say shit like 'if you like this anime you have bad taste' or 'people who watch this are stupid' or something like that. But I'm sorry I'm gonna be that immature person for this once. 
Okay so this anime is apparently considered as the must-watch comedy anime. After reading a few reviews and getting recommended to watch this, I gave it a try. My lord, this shit is unbearable to watch. Never have I in my life cringed this much while watching anime. I kept waiting for the apparently godlike jokes only to realise that the insanely cringy moments are THE jokes. I seriously can't imagine how a grown-up would find the jokes funny or even the anime enjoyable to watch. Because the 'story' of this anime is as boring as it sounds: the daily lives of highschool boys. Yeah, that's it. I don't need to have a dramatic, action-packed, supernatural, romantic storyline. But really, make it at least enjoyable to watch in some way. I have seen other animes with almost no storyline which are much more entertaining than this one. 
I haven't even mentioned the art and characters which are truly horrible. Wtf   is this animation style. Most girls don't have eyes and all the characters look the same. They have the same like - hairstyles but one is blonde and the other brunette... Yeah such a diversity hooray! I understand that you don't need Ufotable level animation for a comedy-parody anime, but at least make it seem like you tried.  
Like I said, the characters are just as horrible as the art. Even for a parody anime they were so boring to see. The females were absolutely the worst. They were just really annoying, dumb, abusive no-eyed gorillas disguised as highschool girls. The sister-characters kept fighting with their younger/older brother for no fucking reason. But hey, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is a comedy anime so this is supposed to be funny :) Well it isn't, the characters are too much even for a comedy serie. This anime is just trying too hard to be funny but fails miserably. 
Sound/music wise it's okay I guess. Nothing special just pretty much the standard.  
I don't get why people praise this anime so much as I can't imagine anyone else than little kids enjoying this shit. Jesus, I need to cleanse my eyes with Hinamatsuri.

Hence the ""old"" -chan saying about how ""Nobody Talks About GOOD Anime.""  (Because, you know.  What gets the attention nowadays is what's bad, controversial, done by ""attention whores,"" and ultimately empty and disposable.) 
Ghost Hunt did its job well for something that tries to be ""old school"" scary as opposed to ""monsters at every turn"" scary.  The people behind it actually try to play up the actual SUSPENSE.  And it's done using characters that actually come off as PEOPLE rather than ""humanized cliches"" I've been sick of seeing. 
The story arcs within Ghost Hunt are actually humane and touching when they want to.  If you ""have a heart,"" you'd be able to feel for the main characters (as the story progresses) and find out why they act how they act. 
I might as well tell you this story about how I was living in my studio apartment back in Sacramento before I moved to Sparks (NV) last year.  The door to the bathroom made a ""knock"" sound whenever I was using the shower; and I wasn't ruling out ""poltergeistal activity"" as one of the reasons. 
(That story won me a Ghost Hunt DVD boxset, and a book about a spooky Texas house, from FUNimation.)

The Daily Lives of Sengoku Girls 
Sengoku Collection is an anime by in large, slice of life genred with a jack all of genres but master of none approach to it's plot structure. Sengoku Collection goes through MANY genre changes depending on the Sengoku girl that it's focusing on the episode, whether it be shounen, mystery, ""horror"", shoujo ai, idol, sci-fi and even space adventure, however how they present and execute it is rather lackluster and is only means to give the Sengoku girl at hand something to do. 
In terms of characters, considering the HUGE cast, almost -/-'s of the cast get at best one episode tops for thier episode focus, the only characters that matter in terms of a narrative focus for LA at least were Oda Nobunaga voiced by Rumi Ookubo (Oda Nobunaga coming into other character's end scenes to collect their secret treasure so occasionally appears here and there), Masamune Date voiced by Ayumi Tsunematsu and Mitsuhide Akechi voiced by Yoko Hisaka and all three get three episodes at best for thier story ""arc"". In terms of character development, the episodic nature of the anime can either give most of the charcacters stock cliches tropes or genre-fueled tropes for the Sengoku girls at hand and because of that, their character development especially the characters given one or two episodes worth of ""development"" is miniscule at best thus making those Sengoku girls' prescences feel rather worthless and filler. 
LA's favourite episodes of this anime were Episode --, --, -- and -- by the way and LA has some guilty pleasure towards Episode -- for it's creative take on a documentary narrative through a kindergarten's sandbox takeover. On the side of the spectrum LA got quickly bored of epsiodes -, -, -- and --. The only - episodes LA thought was in middle of all this was Episode -- and --. 
In terms of animation by Brain's Base, the animation has inconstistency concerning the character designs clashing with the background, as the background animation is very detailed using bright pastel and watercolored background work (special note goes to Episode -- making it look like a depressing children's book style) that clashes heavily with the traditional yet equally bright character designs (with facial and character animation derps abound), LA would praise Brain's Base doing something unique using the background animation but equally fault them for having inconsistent character designs, animation errors (Exception goes to Masamune Date's character design as it fits with her with no animation errors either) and to be frank when there are battles between the Sengoku girls or battle scenes in general feel janky and stiff, the animation overall is inconsistent at best, lazy at worst. 
In terms of voice acting, considering the vast cast list, LA will give it that there are some level of ""squeak"" in the voice cast. But aside from that major props for voice acting goes to Rumi Ookubo as Oda Nobunaga (playing up the abrasive and slight tsundere type), Ayumi Tsunemastu as Masamune Date  and Yoko Hisaka as Mitsuhide Akechi especially (as thier episodes were where LA gave any investment to characters in the series). 
The ending had the common decency to bring us something of what LA was expecting from this anime, ""Sengoku girls fighting it out with the slice of life tones to it"" and at least they gave something of a epilogue to the huge cast of characters EXCEPT Oda Nobunaga's main narrative plotline, essentially saying it's never gonna get resolved, at least giving us how the other Sengoku girls are is a slight bonus???...-sigh-. 
Sengoku Collection, well LA will say it again, a jack of all genres but master of none and LA WILL give anime some grace as it IS a slice of life anime with Sengoku girls as it's focus but outside of it's ""slice of life"" genre to be perfectly honest LA got bored of this series quickly as it had no narrative hook to keep LA interested with the ""one episode Sengoku girls"" being essentially worthless to the overall narrative of Oda Nobunaga or Masamune's. On a off hand note, LA thought the premise of Sengoku girls being transported to the modern day although a good concept, it's execution lacked at any meat to it's product (and no not for being a slice of life), they could have done ALOT more to it (the closest it got was Masamune's story arc). 
Sengoku Collection like it's title is a collection of Sengoku girls with a character-centred slice of life anime, if you like that and want something more laxxed (which was why LA watched this anime in the first place) then it's an ok choice, however if you wanted to see Sengoku girls going crazy with swords shounen style and go to war in modern day Japan...then it's better to look at the reverse-concept anime ""Oda Nobuna no Yabou"" as that had a better concept and execution.

For some reason, Hanada Shounen-shi is a very under-watched slice of life series. 
This is a spoiler free review. 
*Story* 
The premise is basically about a boy who acquires the ability to see ghosts and he helps these ghosts he comes across finish their unfinished business in their past lives. And I'd be lying if I said this hasn't been done before. However, it does lead to some interesting stories that the boy gets involved in with the ghosts past lives. The stories even have a bit of continuity to them with recurring characters and the like, but they are pretty random for the most part. They usually are story arcs that last - or - episodes. Although this is a comedy/slice of life anime so you shouldn't really expect much of a storyline. 
Anyway, the stories always start out with a comedic tone and eventually become very sad the more the boy gets involved in the ghost's past life. The stories probably could've used a little more conflict to it's advantage, but then again, conflict is what other slice of life series take for granted and they fall in to forced drama and other such nonsense. This is something that never really occurs here. So you gotta give it credit for that. And it does indeed remain interesting and entertaining with little to no conflict throughout the entire series. Now that is awesome! 
In addition, in each story arc there's always some interesting turn of events or twist which extends the story, and you most likely won't see them coming and it's generally done very well. 
The story occasionally also involves the boy's school life and such things in which the ghosts are not the focus. Which is a pretty good way to avoid being repetitive and it works. 
The thing that kinda bothered me about the story is that the supernatural aspect probably could've been handled better and with more consistency. For example, it is established that the boy can't touch the ghosts, and then in a different circumstance he can touch them for some reason. Another example is that at some point, the boy can literally jump outside of his own body and become a ghost temporarily just for the sake of a particular story arc he stumbled in to. Without really explaining when or how he learned to do that. So that felt pretty contrived. 
As for how the story concludes… I'd be lying if I said I was completely satisfied with it. I'm not spoiling anything, but the ending was sort of cute and it fits fine with the series. But it's also quite simple and it didn't resolve that much. 
Let's just leave it at that. 
*Characters* 
The characters are pretty damn funny and they are a lot of fun to watch. Their personalities are established very well even though they are very simple in nature, like the easygoing drunk dad, the sister that always gets in to fights with the MC, the tomboy, the sissy boy etc'. 
The main character is a naughty brat named Ichiro who likes being naughty and doing naughty boyish things. He's kinda like Shin Chan (if you're familiar with him) but surprisingly he's a lot more mature, likable and relatable. Because unlike Shin Chan, he's not always naughty just for the sake of being naughty. And he is often scolded by his mother for his behavior because of misunderstandings. He even matures and gets smarter throughout the series, so the character development is there. It's not really done in a very subtle way and nowhere is that more apparent than in the last few episodes. But, overall it was done very well and I don't have complaints about it. I really liked it. 
The complaints I have are mostly with the side characters. I noticed the series goes out of it's way to give us detailed backstories of the ghosts Ichiro comes across, who basically come out of nowhere (which is great), and yet hardly tell us anything about the characters that are right in front of us in pretty much every episode. And who I'm referring to is Ichiro's family. Sure they have a lot of screen time, but they're never focused on appropriately or fleshed out very well, they're just there. And these were pretty interesting characters that had some potential (especially his sister) so that was kind of a waste. 
So what it comes down to is that the MC is generally well developed all the characters are a lot of fun, even though the secondary characters lack development and focus. The ghosts Ichiro comes across often have very touching/sad stories that will likely make you both laugh and cry. So know that at least on an emotional level this series works great thanks to the ghosts and their life stories. 
*Art* 
The artwork is overall really good. Though people are probably turned off by it, because it looks simple and it doesn't have overly cute girls and such. But the fact is that the animation is great, despite what the characters look like. The backgrounds are very detailed and the directing is quite obviously, well above average. It's directed by the same guy who directed 'Monster' and it's by studio Madhouse who usually have very good animation, and this series is no exception to the rule despite just being a simple easygoing slice of life anime. 
*Sound* 
The opening and ending are by the Backstreet boys… Lol, bet you didn't see that coming. I'm no fan, but they do help create an atmosphere. I never even considered skipping the op or the ed while watching this series..  
And together with the very nice and calm ost it has, it works.  
I don't know Japanese, but the voice acting is great, with funny voices. Though I must say it was kinda distracting to hear voice actors from One Piece in this series (I heard Franky, Luffy and Ussop's voices in this, lol). 
*Enjoyment* 
It works very well as a tear jerking comedy. You'd most likely laugh, cry and have a lot of fun. Though the humor is a little toilety and the show might feel kinda cheesy at times. I personally enjoyed it a lot though. 
*Overall* -/-- 
It's really good, But it could've been great with only some little fixes like focusing more on the secondary characters, handling the supernatural element better and an ending that is a little more solid. 
Besides that, this anime is really good and it's definitely worth watching if you like slice of life/comedy anime.

AnoHana: Letters to Menma follows in the tradition of countless other anime movies before it - that is, it functions mostly as a recap of the original series with some new scenes sprinkled throughout. 
If you've seen the original anime (and if you haven't go watch it right now before you read this review), then you're familiar with the story and it's resolution, so I'll spare the summary. The actual movie itself takes place roughly a year after Menma's wish has been granted, and catches up with the rest of the Super Peace Busters as they gather together to write their own letters to Menma, sharing their thoughts and feelings about what she meant to them and how they're doing now that she's gone. 
Using this premise, the show switches back and forth between three different perspectives. The first of these are scenes from when the Super Peace Busters were children, and how they welcomed Menma to their group and played around. From there, we follow the characters writing their letters in the present, preparing for a celebration of sorts for their departed friend. And using that as a springboard, we see flashbacks to events from the actual show, as the process of writing the letters brings them back to the surface. 
The problem with the movie is not so much anything to do with it's characters, story, poor writing, or what have you. Simply put, it suffers from a lack of new content - while maybe half the movie features new scenes (both in the show's present and past), the greater part of it consists of flashbacks and scenes from the original anime. Put together with how often the perspective changes, the result often feels disjointed and slightly unfocused. 
What AnoHana: Letters to Menma does well, however, is provide a little more closure for fans of the anime. Getting to see the Super Peace Busters playing around as children was priceless, and certain scenes even add even more emotional gravitas to the show's powerful ending. That's a tricky feat for something as well written and self-contained as AnoHana - one wrong move and you risk looking revisionist or retroactively harming the story's original impact. And while there wasn't much development during the scenes set in the present, getting to catch up with the characters a year later felt a little like revisiting old friends and was rewarding in it's own way.  
When all is said and done, this is a good movie. It's not without it's problems, and it's not one you should watch without seeing the show first, but it serves nicely as a sort of 'where are they now' and does a fine job of adding additional back story without damaging the integrity of the original show. If you're already a fan of the show, there's nothing you can lose from watching this movie.

""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" 
Tolstoy's quote could have been written about the Shimogamo family (and their close acquaintances.) Uchouten Kazoku's focus is relationships - between the brothers and their mother; between the Simogamo and their Ebisugawa cousins; between Yasaburo and his teacher; and between the different factions of intelligent beings living in Kyoto. 
It was thought provoking, bitter sweet, funny and strange. 
It has a bit of a surreal quality about it. The character of Benten can fly and use other Tengu magic despite being human, but no one seems to find this strange. The tanuki are weirdly placid about the idea of being eaten. The humans in the story are also strangely unaffected by the idea of eating a fellow sophont. These things together combine to remind us, sometimes subtly and sometimes not-so-subtly, that the world of the story is not our usual world. 
The writers tackled the problem of evoking sympathy for an alien intelligence in a unique way. The tanuki are drawn mostly as ""normal"" people, making them easy to identify with for the viewer. By contrast, humanity comes across as strange and capricious, impossible to understand. It was enjoyably different.

This is the first review I'm going to write, and probably the only review unless I can find another anime that will make me re-watch this - or more times in a row. 
Okada Mari delivered her forte again: Romance and coming of age story. I'll write this review on my perspective so feel free to agree/disagree. It doesn't matter to me since I ain't some professional critic and only writing this because I love the series a lot. 
Story: --/--  
Story was pretty well developed with it starting how Jun became the girl she was. She made an attempt to escape from reality, encountered many problems in school and got encouraged to speak again. The journey of her recovering her courage to speak again was pretty touching, it wasn't too rushed nor slow. The pacing for this series was perfect in my opinion I'll say Okada Mari delivered another masterpiece.  
Characters: --/-- 
Pretty realistic characters with very realistic developments. None of the bullshit where they beautify the setting. Character interactions were realistic and that brings out the individual charm of the entire cast. Throughout the series, we see how the - main characters actually developed. Each and every one of them being inspired by Jun to convey what they want to say into words instead of bottling up and regretting. Again, the development of the characters were pretty well paced out, thus making the story flow even better. 
Art: --/-- 
I love the character design here. As expected from Tanaka who also did the character designs for Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, Ano Natsu de Matteru and the upcoming Kimi no Na wa, just to name a few. I can't find any faults here. The character designs were appropriate for the series. 
Sound: --/-- 
This is probably the best part of the show besides the story. The music rendition of Beethoven's -th Piano Sonata, Over the rainbow, Greensleeves etc... were all wonderful. Having been part of musicals, and the choral team myself during my school years, I'll say this is wonderfully done. Masaru and Jin did spectacularly in this department. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say the music is one reason why I love this series a lot. Since the story centers around the musical, this department must be well executed for the movie to be that good for me to keep re-watching it. I even bought the OST along with the BD because the music was just too good. 
Lastly, with the above ratings, there is no prize as to how much I enjoyed it - for I wouldn't re-watch this series -- times(as of this point of writing) if I didn't enjoy. I'll probably say enjoy may be an understatement, it's more like this movie have been ingrained into my life. This series is the first movie that made it into my favorites and it'll be there forever. 
Well done to the production team!  
そして、お疲れ様です！

Sword Art Online has never really been my type of anime but I can see the appeal for a lot of people.  So when I was invited to see the movie, I walked in with low expectations and unfortunately lived up to them. 
Story: - 
SAO never had the strongest of plots and this movie is no different. Kirito and friends are once again thrown into a new game which ends up another fight for their lives only this time, it takes place in the real world using augmented reality. Besides from being generic and predictable, most of it barely made any sense. SAO never fails to impress me on how far I should suspend my disbelief but this movie takes the cake on how often I questioned the choice in writing for some parts especially towards the end. It's lazy writing at its best where things just conveniently work out. 
There's also a romantic side plot between Kirito and Asuna if you're into that but it barely goes anywhere. But at least it wasn't a harem. 
Art: - 
It's A- Pictures and their most popular series. Of course it's going to look good for a movie. The animation team really went all out for the fight scenes making them as flashy as possible while making it easy to follow. Definitely one of the few things that is good in SAO. This would have been a -- if they didn't use some really cheap CGI for some of the minor monsters but the main fights are beautifully animated. 
Sound: - 
SAO is also pretty decent when it comes to sound design and music. The fights sounded pretty good and voice acting suited the characters. They were able to incorporate some of the music through a new character who acts as the game's mascot/idol. It did get kinda old after the second time she appeared and sung but it's a part of the generic plot. 
Characters: - 
It's the same old cast of Kirito and his friends which are all generally shallow and one-dimensional. The movie does do a good job at showing who these characters were for people who aren't too familiar with the series. Fans will appreciate these familiar faces appearing again as they tried to cram as many as they could into the movie. 
The new characters are fairly generic but my biggest gripe is with the main villain. They tried to make him seem justified in his actions but he just comes off as dick for no reason. Yet at the same time, there isn't enough to hate or love the character and ends up feeling completely useless to the plot. 
All of the characters had very weak to no motive in their actions. The writers were trying to go the emotional route to connect to the audience more but I'm left feeling disconnected because the characters barely act human at all. 
Enjoyment: - 
I enjoyed the action scenes in the movie and how ridiculous the writing got but the fact that there are more holes than swiss cheese in the plot just made it frustrating to watch. I sat there asking myself ""why?"" throughout the film and got to the point where I wasn't even amazed anymore with its lackluster writing. The actions scenes have been the main selling point of SAO so at least those are good. 
There is a lot of small details that fans of SAO will appreciate and enjoy but fanservice can't hide these plot holes. 
Overall: - 
Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale suffers the same faults as the series with its badly written story and poorly developed characters. I do think the movie is better since it's only like two hours long and they weren't able to drag things out forever. I wasn't expecting this movie to ""fix"" what was wrong with the series but I can't fault what makes SAO so popular. Fans will love this movie, even though it technically isn't the best. It checks out every box on how a SAO movie was suppose to be and I'd be surprised if they broke away from this.

I don't usually write reviews, but after seeing all the --'s on here, I felt as if I had to. Also, this is my first review, so please forgive me if it's a bit over the place.  
Yuri!!! On Ice was one of my favorite anime from last year. It's a show I thought I wouldn't like at all, but when it began airing, everyone was telling me how good it was, so I had to watch it. I was hooked instantly on episode five. I nearly cried on the last episode and I knew quickly it deserved to be in my top ten. A few months later, people began going nuts over a short special that was going to show Yurio's and Otabek's exhibition skate coming out in May and even I got quite excited. Now the special is finally out, and even being a YOI fan, I found some issues in a two minute special.  
In the original series, I was super happy to see that they gave Yurio a friend, and I do think it was a good idea to make a small special showing something from the show that we didn't get to see before. It's a great idea to see Yurio and Otabek bond together and see their friendship grow and before their exhibition skate together, but when do they talk about skating together? Never. We don't get to see them talking about skating together, it just happens. Granted, there is an upcoming manga showing them talking about skating together as a pair, but this is the special, not the manga, and this two minute special would've worked way better as an OVA. An OVA would've shown Otabek and Yurio talking together, discussing their exhibition skate, bonding together, and letting their friendship grow. Because of this, this short feels like it's rushed, and that problem also ties into the original show, which was also a bit rushed. Then again, this is a two minute special that's trying to be its own thing with a story that's not meant to be extremely criticized. All the creators wanted to do was show Yurio and Otabek skating together as a pair, and that's totally fine. This isn't something that needs a big story to carry it to greatness, this is its own thing that's trying to fix a small issue/nitpick we had with the original TV series, and for what we did get, it was handled rather well. This special is still interesting and immerses you in what's going on and what's happening. Not only that, it also brings back that excitement we got from the TV series. White it could've been better as an OVA, what we got was passable.  
A problem I had in the original series was the skating animation. Not all of it was bad, but there was a massive decline as the series went on, giving us a lot of hilarious faces and poses. In this special, however, there is none of that. The animation here is GORGEOUS. It's crisp, clear, fast-paced, and beautiful. There is not one shot that has a derp moment. The animation is mostly centered on Yurio, and every single second on him is near perfection. The way he moves and dances make him feel as if he's real. He moves like an actual human being. Even Otabek, who doesn't move around that much, is also beautifully animated and drawn. When he does move, he feels like he's real because both he and Yurio move so naturally. The shots given to both of the characters and even the audience are well drawn and are actually clever. When Yurio does a special Johnny Weir move, the ""camera"" pans to him leaning back and gliding across the ice, and even then it flows perfectly. The animation knows when the show the perfect shots, knows how to make the characters move naturally and humanly, and knows how to be beautiful. The series animation may have faulted in some areas, but here, it almost makes up for it by being almost perfect.  
I enjoyed every character from Yuri!!! On Ice; even the side characters. While they didn't get as much screen time as I wish, I still remember them for their relatability and personalities. In here, I have only two characters to criticize, in both a positive and slightly negative way. Let's start with Yurio. Yurio is a very interesting character. He's an angsty teen with a soft spot for tigers and his grandpa, while also having incredible talent in skating. In this special, it kind of delivers on what his character is: An edgy teen. The music and dances perfectly embodies his character, and honestly, make him more interesting. The music is screaming, ""Fuck you, this is who I am,"" and that's all I really have to say. It's just Yurio. An angsty, edgy teenager. It's quite incredible to see how you can show who your character is from just poses and music. Otabek, however, I'm mixed on. In my opinion, he was one of the most boring characters from YOI and was shoehorned in so hard. And nothing has changed. He still feels shoehorned and boring. What do we know about him? He likes bears, he's a DJ, and he's Kazahk. Yeah, those things about him are pretty cool, but he as a character still falls flat. I know he doesn't say much, but if this short can make Yurio a bit more interesting, it's a bit disappointing that Otabek hasn't even changed. I wish the special could have made him do a bit more. I do like Otabek for what we got in the show, but I wish he did more. It's quite disappointing. But then again, this special is trying to be something else and totally different from the series, and it's not looking for huge character development, and I probably wouldn't haven't been so hard on it if Yurio stayed the way he was, but since Yurio changed, it's disappointing how Otabek is still boring. Again, this isn't looking for huge character development, and I do feel like I'm being a bit hard on it, and for what we got, it's pretty decent.  
I love YOI, and I do believe this a good special to tie the fans over until the movie comes out, but there are a few issues that people aren't recognizing. While the animation is near perfect, Yurio became a bit more interesting, it's great to see Yurio and Otabek interacting with each other more, Otabek remains boring, it's a bit rushed, and we don't really get to see Otabek and Yurio talking with each other about skating together. Yet, this is a special that isn't meant to be judged so harshly, if it was, I'd probably lower the rating to a -/--. YOI is an anime for everyone, and the love behind it is so strong it just makes me love the series more, and this special has the same love put into the show. If there is something else I really like about the short, it's that it's very entertaining. I was drawn to the screen not only because I was happy to see something YOI related again, but because of the animation and that it was just interesting. It's a good short, nothing more and nothing less, and it's a good tie up for the upcoming movie, and that makes me incredibly happy.

So I heard that an anime called Ongaku Shoujo was going to be made this year. Then I saw it was a ---minute OVA before that, and I sat down to watch it. But I won't lie, this OVA is really bad. 
I mean, seriously. I've never seen something so absolutely insipid, vapid, and downright annoying. It's basically about two girls, a shy blue-haired girl and a perky blonde haired girl, who run into each other thanks to singing, decide to become idols, and a lot of drama happens. That's it. There's absolutely nothing about its storyline that makes any effort to stand out, it doesn't even try to make use of its potential or be interesting in any way. It's just a cookie cutter cutesy idol drama anime with no substance to it at all. Many anime I've seen that were similar to this one happened to pull off the premise much better, and the ham-fisted drama near the end really didn't endear me to it at all. It doesn't help that the characters are bland, empty, and have no substance to them at all, and their voice actresses overact to hell and back, and every single line that comes out of their mouth is hammy, screechy, high pitched, and downright grating on the ears, which is a shame because I know these actresses can put on MUCH better performances. 
Honestly, the only good thing about this OVA is the animation. It's bright and colorful, very stimulating to the eyes, and the character movement is very fluid, almost KyoAni-like in its smoothness. Unfortunately, that's where the OVA's good qualities end. 
But all of its flaws absolutely cannot compare to what I feel is the biggest detriment of this OVA: Haru. 
She alone basically ruined the entire OVA. Simply put, she is annoying as hell! Not only is her design really stupid-looking (Why does she have that big bow in her hair, along with all those other hair clips?! They're not necessary, and it looks way too tacky!), the show tries to present her as a fun, perky, enthusiastic, cheerful girl who wants to be friends with Eri, the blue haired girl, but the way the anime executes her overall character makes her come off as unrelentingly bratty, self-entitled, selfish, and almost creepily parasitic in her persistence in attaching herself to Eri in some of the worst, most dangerous ways possible. She's also a complete idiot who not only does stupid things, but never gets punished for them. For example, when she goes to school, she brings a cat with her, and the teacher doesn't even call her out on the fact that she brought a cat with her. Aren't cats not allowed on school property? She also has absolutely NO respect for privacy and boundaries whatsoever. She goes through Eri's belongings, goes after her in the hot springs, and worst of all, when Eri is struggling with reading a book out loud in class, what's Haru's solution? Why mess with her body without her consent and physically UNDO HER BRA RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! Oh, and at the end of the OVA, her solution to making Eri come up on stage is to put every embarrassing photo she took of her on display, on a big LCD screen, IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE AUDIENCE, EVEN NUDE PHOTOS, THEREBY HUMILIATING HER IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! 
You see what I'm getting at here? If someone did that to me, I'd report them for sexual harassment! But does Haru get in trouble for it? Nope! Well, to be fair, Eri does call out Haru on everything she's done, but it doesn't stick because it's all played for comedy, and Eri is meant to be seen as just a prude who won't accept Haru's so-called ""friendship."" Sakura, Eri's friend, is even worse in this regard because not only does she completely ignore Eri's discomfort and never makes any attempt to help, but outright encourages Haru's dangerous behavior! Seriously, if this were a horror or a Lifetime-drama movie, I'm pretty sure Haru's behavior would be presented in a much more dark and serious light, as it should be. But the anime doesn't realize the ramifications of Haru's actions and tries to make the audience see it as nothing but cute and endearing!...which it seriously isn't. At all. Honestly, I wanted to jump in there and save Eri from that parasitic little brat. She deserves better than to be their target. Also not helping matters is that Haru is extremely egotistical and self-entitled, convinced that she's hot stuff and is a great singer...when she actually sucks really bad at singing. Eri even tells her such. 
So...yeah. This OVA really could have been something good. Unfortunately, it's just not good. At all. This, my friends, is the prime example of how a really, really bad and badly written main character can completely ruin a show in its entirety. Thankfully, it seems like the creators realized this as well, since from what little they revealed recently, the upcoming TV series features a completely different storyline with a plethora of new characters, with Eri and Haru being just side characters now. I hope to God that the TV series doesn't make the same mistakes that this OVA did. Then again, Birdy The Mighty Decode turned a flawed OVA into a great TV series from what I've heard, so it can happen. 
But in the end, though, Ongaku Shoujo is utter crap, all because Haru's a little shit.

Grand Blue is a Zero-G comedic anime from last year. I can't speak to the quality of their work in general since I only found thirteen titles listed for them and haven't seen any of them. It's based off of a manga by Inoue Kenji. Well, I like a lot of slice of life comedies so this may be relevant to my interests. Let's take a look.  
Story: 
Our protagonist is Kitahara Iori. A young man who moves into his Uncle's place while attending college. Once there, he's immediately marked by the diving club, which is made up largely of drunken morons who can't keep their clothes on. They coerce him into joining, sensing a kindred spirit. The series basically covers Iori's exploits and club activities.  
Let's start with the massive, gaping issue with the series. It isn't funny. For the vast majority of it, we just watch these drunken idiots act like drunken idiots. It's like watching that group you always avoided at University very closely and that's just annoying. There's a reason you avoid the intellectual shrimps who just want to party in a loud, obnoxious fashion. Another thing the series seems to find absolutely hilarious is giving the characters stupid looking, exaggerated features. Which kind of contributes to the generally annoying atmosphere. Then we have the humour that centers around Nanaka wanting to sex up her sister. It's like the worst part of Yuru Yuri, except the rest of the humour is on par with it.  
Actually, any time this series touches on the idea of romance it's horrible in some way. Whether it's Iori getting caught being pervy towards one of his cousins, the aforementioned sister complex, the group of incels or the bisexual fan-service girl.  
Characters: 
Another big problem with the series as a whole is that the characters are all horrible. You pretty much hate --% of them within minutes of them showing up and they don't even have the defence of being well written characters. They're very shallow. Unfortunately, they're shallow in a way that makes them incredibly unbearable.  
Now, I'm not saying you need characters who are amicable for a comedy to work. The BBC's Black Adder serves as proof positive that you can have characters who are terrible people in a comedy and make it work really well. But that series has the benefit of clever writing and the writers made the titular character a charming rogue in every series save one. That factor, coupled with the cunning behind his actions does make him both interesting and funny. This series doesn't have any cleverness or charm to speak of. Which just makes the awful characters a slog to deal with.  
Art: 
This is the one element where I can give the series some credit. The underwater scenes where we don't have insipid dialogue, shite facial expressions or any garbage character interactions to deal with can look very nice. If this series were just the seven or eight minutes of underwater scenery, I could enjoy it somewhat.  
Of course, it does have issues with really stupid looking facial expressions popping up constantly and the characters randomly taking off their clothes because Inoue apparently finds nudity to be the funniest thing of all time.  
Sound: 
While Grand Blue does have some talented voice actors, it's also one of those series where they aren't allowed to have good performances. The dialogue is so over-exaggerated and the characters are so devoid of anything resembling complexity that it becomes nearly as annoying to listen to as it is to watch. The music is, at least, only sub-par.  
Ho-yay: 
We have Nanaka with her romantic feelings towards her own sister. We also have Azusa, who is openly bisexual. The series also loves to make jokes in poor taste about people mistaking Iori for having romantic feelings towards his otaku friend.  
Areas of Improvement: 
Having clever jokes instead of loud, obnoxious unfunny ones.  
There is literally no benefit to the nudity, just have your characters keep their clothes on.  
Just say no to the incest. At best, it's cringey and mildly unpleasant. At worst, it's fecking terrible.  
Final Thoughts: 
This is easily among the worst comedies I've ever seen. It tries to force humour out of being loud and obnoxious but, ultimately, all that does is make it loud and obnoxious. You hate the characters pretty much within minutes of them showing up. The actors are wasted since you could just replace their lines with a crying baby and it would only be mildly more annoying. Ultimately, it's just an unpleasant, horribly written and devoid of humour work. I'm giving it a -/-- and it only gets that high of a score because of the nice underwater scenery. If you really find drunken idiots charming, it may be the series for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest staying away from it.

Story 
If anything great happened when you weren't there to see it there is some record of it. Whether it is documented in film, written in a book or if all else fails someone plays witness to it. The witness will most likely tell people who will tell people in turn. Like wild fire will spread around. Unfortunately, this does more harm than good. For what are the heroes to do when confronted with phonies? Since, it is all word of mouth no one is to say they are or aren't who they say they are. The moral of the story is before rewarding for what you think is true attempt to research the truth yourself. A lot of people exist in the world good and bad. You don't want to lose big for lack of trying do you?  
Art 
Okay, but the art was slightly bright. I understand that the scene was in a hot environment but it ruins the show the way it was done. Luckily the brightness issue exists mainly in the introduction. 
Sound- no complaints 
Character 
-Main characters are those who you see often in a show. It is kind of disappointing when one of the main characters roles has only a minor role. Plus, the specific character that had the 'minor role' was female. Normally, that would not matter per-say but her parts were mainly if not all beauty centered. For some people this may cause some aggravation. On how there is more to a girl/women than appearances. 
-another aspect worth noting is the plan of the phonies. Later does one realize the sad truth behind the facade but you would think given their sad story they wouldn't act so rude/ungrateful especially being falsely rewarded. An example worth noting is the wiping of the mouth. 
Overall 
The movie may lack luster, lack in action but is strong in moral/kindness. Although, as kind as that may be it was foolish. Seeing how they are fighters fighting in a hot environment. Which means a lot of energy is being burned off. Without proper replenishment the body will collapse.

After re-watching the first two seasons beforehand, I felt like the series was way better than I could remember and I watched a lot of episodes with watery eyes.  My love for the series even grew. 
There used to be such a good balanced dynamic where I cared for both ghouls and humans, the characters were deep, the build-up and climax in the first - seasons were amazing. The character development was outstanding, I did not mind that it was not exactly like the manga. And the last episode was vague and left me craving for more, cause there were so many ways things could turn out, so much space to work with for the writers. 
The anime was story based, with the right amount of combat, almost every fight felt unique, exquisite and progressive. 
But then I watched Re; It started as a huge mess: They bombed in new characters in the first episode, humans with ghoul powers and it really took the depth out of the series. I did not care much about any of them, cause I barely got to know them and none of them felt deep. 
Where there used to be a story, it feels like in this season they tried to compensate story with combat and gore in almost every episode and almost all fights felt rather superficial. 
I felt almost nothing while watching this season, except when the older characters showed up. The onion cutting ninja's where no where to be found, while in the first - seasons if someone died it was tragic. 
I actually thought I was watching the wrong series, cause it often felt like a parody or filler arc. 
I would have preferred no sequel over this abomination, cause before the sequel there were so many interesting ways things could have turned out. 
I sincerely hope this season will be discarded as filler content and they will just start over where root A / season - ended.

Kanata no ASTRA is, I think, like a proverbial overachiever underdog (especially of its specific season): one that nobody really expects to shine in any way, but everyone can come to like very easily, and then time and time again it surprises people with one thing or another. It's not perfect, but it does everything it sets out to do very well, and then sprinkles it with several extras. It's sci-fi, but it's more fiction than science; and while it does a good job of skirting several serious issues on several occasions, it never really goes deep into any of it. Personally, I think all of these characteristics are perfectly fine, as it really doesn't feel like something that was intended to be ""mature entertainment"". Indeed, if anything, this is sci-fi for - well, perhaps not for kids, but younger teens for sure, those who want a somewhat typical space adventure with a bit of Robinson Crusoe / Star Trek Voyager splashed into it. 
Voyager actually seemed like a great parallel at the beginning, as being flung into a far, unknown part of space is definitely something that holds infinite possibilities for an immense amount of content. Ie. a series based on that could run for several seasons. I really couldn't imagine how a story like this could end in -- episodes, especially when the main cast grew on me pretty fast, despite their initial bland impression. Much like how there's a common feat they all share, which might make them feel ""all the same"", they're all equally loveable as well. But that doesn't make them boring: they also each have their own story and background, which are perhaps not overly unique but definitely more than enough to make them their own distinct selves - this opens up doors to being relatable. I'm pretty sure everyone can find at least one thing in at least one of these kids that they can personally relate to, setting and circumstances notwithstanding, whether that's a weird quirk or a past trauma. 
Which is pretty much what makes ASTRA great and greatly enjoyable. Despite the silly jokes and quirks, despite the sometimes questionable science, despite some potential plot inconsistencies, despite some really ridiculous details, despite the abrupt shifts in tone from very heavy and dark into outright moronic and vice versa - it manages to realise its core concept: it's a camp experience (turned space adventure). A bunch of random kids who don't really have anything to do with each other, apart from being in the same group, growing up as they go through hurdles and fights, share tears and laughter, as they discover space in a fight for their survival - and, in parallel, discover the shared secret of their existence, which they also find themselves having to fight for. Personally, I've never had much of a great camp experience myself as a kid, and yet this anime managed to put some rose-tinted glasses on me and give me fond thoughts of reminiscence. If that's not spectacular enough, it's still a great space adventure with quite a lot of plot twists to even make for a rather consistent suspense. 
As a sidenote, something we shouldn't pass by without mentioning: I think the biggest takeaway from this entire anime is the fact that you cannot tell a good story well enough in just -- episodes, which seems to have been such a default for almost every series for years. It's way too restrictive, especially with a greater cast; it doesn't leave enough time for proper characterisation or dramatisation; and if you even factor in the openings and endings and previews and fanservice, it's clear that it's actually detrimental. Look at how ASTRA handled it: the first and last episodes are double length, effectively making it -- episodes; both the OP and the ED were skipped several times, because even that extra one and a half or three minutes mean that much more time for fleshing things out - or when not skipped, they actually provided additional material for the episode in the form of extra shots or ""photographs"" of scenes we didn't get to see; there was one episode that provided some fanservice in a mostly organic, well integrated way; and I'm not even sure previews were a thing at all. Now, with all this, there still remained quite a few events that were glossed over way too quickly. There still were details that didn't make sense because they were poorly set up (if they were set up at all). There still were plot points that felt like miniature black holes - which just don't feel right, however appropriate black holes might be for the genre. As great as ASTRA is, with these in mind, it's also a very good case against the ---episode standard, exactly because the smaller glitches are that much more noticeable in something that's overall rather high quality.

Oh boy, hold on to your underpants for this one... Shimoneta literally means dirty joke, and you'll get more than both ears worth in this show. Whereas Seitokai Yakuindomo had a lot of implied dirty jokes, Shimonata literally doesn't hold any punches. Though I'm still not quite sure how this got on TV, expect everything in the ecchi drawing book from panties and upskirts galore to what can only be described as soft core porn with many smiley stickers on the screen. 
The show is about, ironically, an idealized Japan where everything lewd is purged Fahrenheit --- style; and where everyone is forced to wear bracelets tracked by Big Brother. In this world, we find a girl ""terrorist"" who spreads lewd pictures and wears a panty on her head as a mask in the name of celebrating sexuality. Into this comes our protagonist, the son of an erotic terrorist who wants nothing more than to go to school with his idealized figure of purity, Anna. While trying to save another student from being falsely accused of molestation, Tanukichi is targeted by the accuser and saved from the police -er... morality officers- by none other than the girl terrorist. How will this fateful encounter ripple through this innocent Japan? Be warned, this show is not for the faint of heart- proceed only if shows like High School DxD or ImoCho do not faze you. 
Animation: 
The show is drawn in a bright color palette with average backgrounds and lighting. The funding seems focused on the ridiculous variety of ecchi in the show. From indecent postcards to sparkling ""love juice"", expect all sorts of soft core attempts to awaken a dude's walrus (they apparently chose that instead of the more typical elephant). In any case, expect this to be one of the most outrageously in-your-face ecchi shows out there. As for character styling, everyone is... unique I guess? All I can say is, not everyone is as pure as they initially seem... 
Sound: 
The puns and dirty jokes continue even into the OP and EDs (some of which ""educate"" the viewer into how to make a ""pleasant"" mold among other things). The OP has an unnecessarily long introduction before launching into a rather old-sounding song, though it's clearly designed for the show. Annoyingly, the main theme is catchy- just make sure no one catches you humming to it in public. The funky ED, if anything, is even more catchy and fitting for the show; note that the lyrics are pretty NSFW. The BGM has many brass instruments, fitting for the ecchi-based theme. However, more noticeable is the virtually endless visual and auditory censoring. 
As for VAs, you have a mix between veterans and relative new actors. On the veteran's side, you have the instantly-recognizable voice of Satomi Arai, and, amazingly, Yui Horie voicing a young brat, whose hair takes the form of a certain mushroom shape when she get's ""energized"". Oh, and if you feel a need to control your bulge when listening to Anna, don't forget that you're listening to the aroused groans of a ---year-old veteran. Overall, expect a fair performance with a ridiculous amount of screaming and censoring. 
Story: 
As alluded to earlier, the show is about a terrorist organization called ""SOX"" and its efforts to spread dirty jokes and, to a more benign degree, sexual education to the general populace. The show successfully pokes fun of the glaring problems when there is no sexual education for children, while also ignoring the ridiculous improbability of such a world existing in the first place. 
The show follows a central plotline with a well established pattern of introducing supporting characters before launching into a few arcs each with a small climax, not counting those in your pants. There aren't very many plot twists, and the few that are present are given huge amounts of foreshadowing so that seasoned viewers should be able to pretty much guess their way through the entire show. 
The mood of the show is, for the most part, very light and filled with (as the title implies) dirty jokes and ecchi. The actual plot is rather mild in intensity, and doesn't really make very much progress. The core of this show is the dirty jokes, and if that's not what you're here for you're better off looking elsewhere. 
Character: 
I ought to echo what I just said above, but for the sake of entertainment, I won't. The characters in this show are not that great, they have barely any exposition and really are all just sexually-curious teenagers, regardless of whether or not they actually state so. I guess both Tanukichi and Anna are dynamic characters, though Anna sort of feels like she's taken directly from a hentai at times. Don't expect much from this category, unless your goal is to see characters in outrageous outfits and circumstances. 
Value: 
Though dirty jokes can be a fair tool at appropriate times, this show takes it far, far beyond that. The show with supposedly the highest moral-based setting is ironically one of the most lecherous, non-hentai works out there. Though unique in its approach, I wouldn't be surprised if many people shun its parody; similar to how one could shun --sai. This show is for those who appreciate ecchi, and can handle it in large quantities. For everyone else, may your eyes find more peaceful sights elsewhere.

The adventure of Hyakkimaru & Dororo, and what an adventure it was. A weathered, angry sapling with its freshly bloomed makeup on; two companions whose goal is to not only survive, but to thrive and challenge the bane that is the land beneath their very feet. 
Underneath the sombre atmosphere that 'Dororo' (I'll quote the name of the anime to distinguish between the character) uses to tether the viewer's attention is a grand, beautiful & somewhat casual adventure.  
'Dororo' is as raw and raw gets; but it has a pace. It's serene, yet condescending and that is what makes this anime adaption much more special than the manga & previous anime adaption. MAPPA have *almost* perfected an already perfect story. 
Love, loss, lust; despair, distain, dishonour; the dark reality that encompasses the world of 'Dororo' & that is the immediate impression we are given and the one that stole my attention. And that is why I must give the story at --/--... 
Story (--/--): 
This is no fairy tale (I suppose you can take that as a homophone too) nor is it your standard ""protagonist vs the world"" redemption story, this is a gripping, thriving and illustrously gloomy story that refills its fountain pen with the blood it spills. I have never seen such a splendid dance between a dystopia & a utopia. And it's consistent! An adventure that does not one bit betray its roots, not even for moments where the slim chance of hope becomes a hyperbolic fragment in an arc. 
I never anticipated the first episode to become such a grand & bewildering story. As linear as the story is, that is what an adventure is supposed to be and 'Dororo' does not hesitate when sticking to that story. If you're a fan of becoming part of an adventure & experiencing two lost souls finding their place in the world, this story will bless you with a true feel of adventure unlike anything you've ever experienced before. 
Easily a --/--. 
Art (-/--): 
And yet another consistent part of 'Dororo' (although there are only some incredibly minor inconsistencies) that cosies the ironic serenity of the story in an airtight container; the perpetual unknowingness seeps through the fixated rain clouds & breaks through as our two companions seek enlightenment. What a heartwarming & wholesome way to give an already wholesome story a platform... 
But yes, we do need to talk about the inconsistencies - one scene in particular which is just ridiculous and I hope whoever lazily animated it was fired immediately. Alas, it should not further taint an intentionally tainted story: 'Dororo's' art style is a visual symphony of horrors, glistened by the gory, rage-filled blades of Hyakkimaru. -/--. 
Sound (--/--): 
Giiivveee meeee fiyyaaarrrrr!!! Wow, what a unique OP huh? Was not expecting a rap verse at all, but it worked and unironically suits Hyakkimaru's personality. Of course, it was met with yet another brilliant OP and therefore I cannot feel too much melancholy over no longer screaming along with the first OP and thus giving myself a sore throat. 
And if you thought the OP was too ""op"", you should hear the endings... I much, much prefer the first ending due to how brisk yet warming it is and it sunk in with the closure of every episode. The latest one carries a different beauty that befits the latter half of Dororo. 
As for the voice acting, Hyakkimaru has one of the best VAs I've ever heard. It fulfils the premise of his character fair better than his previous portrayal in the --s production, but that's to be expected. --/-- for me! 
Character (-/--): 
After refusing to pull several punches, you sort of ""get it"" with 'Dororo'. It's not going to let anyone off the hook and it certainly established that motif for me. But that's what made me, not only adore it, but mentally worship it. Worship it, because it is different and it completely owns it. You darn kids want to see some sort of ""Mario rescues Princess Peach from the castle"", well guess what: 'Dororo' will stab her through every artery in her body, roast her in lava, have her get ground-pounded by Bowser and let Mario discover her burnt, boneless corpse. That's 'Dororo' & that is how quickly a character can go from breathing to bleeding. 
Hyakkimaru & Dororo are the most ironically innocent and compelling duo, they were fated to meet by destiny it seems and their adventure was already set in motion from the moment they were born. Hyakkimaru is certainly a unique character, as after all he is the focus here. I use ""unique character"" elusively here, as he is a samurai and he is well-versed in sword fighting as you'd expect, but he is so brutal, he is so unrelenting. You can feel the fire burning in his polysterine heart and while he can't feel anything on the outside, he certainly can on the inside. And that is what distinguishes Hyakkimaru from other samurai characters: he refuses to let his disability define him and rather he takes full esteem of it. Excellent character, excellent development and excellent portrayal. As for Dororo, she needn't change all too much... the adventure was her's after all, and she developed with it. 
While the upsides overwhelm the downsides, there is one lingering thing I cannot get over: how does Hyakkimaru learn to talk properly right away? He couldn't hear anyone, he cannot possibly have learned it overnight... the lack of clarifaction there is what prevents me from giving it a --/--. So that means it's a -/--! 
Enjoyment (--/--): 
Easily a --/--. I always keep a watch of countdowns to when a new episode would air on Amazon Prime & get even more excited after being reimmersed into the gorgeously gloomy world of 'Dororo'. The ambience surrounding the careful brew of adventure, action and tragedy is what allows this anime to thrive in my heart while leaving wakes of sorrow. The intensity from fight scenes showed no signs of limits and the animators definitely had a lot of fun displaying Hyakkimaru's exceptional fighting capabilities. Absolutely loved how overwhelmingly destructive he is with his swords, very much reminds me of Gintama's brutality and gore in fight scenes. 
'Dororo' left a welt in the centre of my chest & let it overgrow with roses and tulips. Bittersweet is one way to describe it, however I would love to again revisit how consistent this anime is. Perhaps it was the adventure aspects followed by the linear quest of Hyakkimaru, but it felt so raw in a way where you don't really know who to empathise with. It never forgot the story it was portraying nor did it leave behind the important values of the two main characters. They grow together, they evolve together; they try to escape the cradle of fate and repaint the land with a fresh coat of red paint. 
If it's not the unrelenting gore of 'Dororo' that carves its name in your heart, then it'll be Dororo's wholesome smile that will transform your screen into a mirror. And for that reason, I have to give this absolute masterpiece a --. 
Remember to always look forward & persevere together! Just like these two.

My only problem with Alicization is that the anime is just so poorly made. I am a SAO fan since the beginning, and the Chinese community(which is my community)have a generally positive attitude towards SAO, so I never found any problems with it. I've seen the mangas, I've read the novels, and I have to admit; the Alicization novel is a masterpiece. We all know that the author of SAO wrote the first few novels to win a competition, and due to the length requirement, there was not much detail description or character developments. He wrote the Alicization novel years later with obviously better writing and anyone who've seen it will call it a masterpiece even they did not like the series. All the problems with the anime is never a problem in the novel. The pacing feels great, and the story is comparable to the good stories such as Erase(which I just watched a few days ago). The character development and etc are amazing, you just can't find much fault with it. But the anime was a mess, I did not enjoy it as much as the novel AT ALL. It has the same problems as The Rising of the Shield Hero, which I've also read the novel, the first few episodes are amazing. Especially the hour-long first episode for both. But as the story advances obvious mistakes were made. Such as characters out of shape or bad(and often) scene divisions. The Scene divisions is a total mess and the fighting quality drops, etc. The thrill the novel can give me never occurs a single bit in the anime. For people who think the anime is bad, you are correct but do not forget that the story itself has no fault with it. A-- once again ruined a masterpiece. Congrads.

Have you ever thought of how your choices may change your whole life? This show explores this wonderful possibility in changing one's choices. 
First of all the story was taken from an entirely new perspective which was unexpected of till the --th episode. This show tells us the different pathways a young college student takes. It took my breath away in the first episode. The Intro to climax to the ending of each episode was enjoyable. The pacing was well done. The ending of each episode left me craving for more 
The comedy aspect of this show was spot on. To the subtle background humour to the main jokes used. The personification of things was genius. The art style is Unique and is the most appealing part of this show. Many of my friends told me it was what put them off but once you see it you will love it. 
The character development was splendid. It is shown slightly through each recall. But it hits you hard in the face near the ending. The intended message on the desire for more in everyday life was well conveyed.Point is life has no right answer, every life has pro's and cons. All in all its a must watch. I wish I had seen this earlier.--/-- will recommend to everyone.

Have you ever taken a shit in your pants while in a public place before? Or walk into a Red Lobster bathroom to find a couple awkwardly fucking each other on the mildew infested tiles?  
That's kind of what it feels like watching this anime. You feel like you've just stumbled into or have unwittingly become part of an embarrassing situation and you're only options are either to slowly back out gracefully or watch it play out to it's illogical conclusion (that couple by the way, didn't really mind me being there, I just wanted a breath mint). ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" is an anime that dares you to sit through every single one of it's episodes while you brutally suppress the urge to go watch something better.  
The story, that seems to have been begrudgingly inserted into this anime is that the world is on the verge of peak magic with mercenaries, pirates and George W Bush roaming the countryside looking for that next fix to fuel their oversized killing-machine vehicles. The only people who have possession of that sweet, sweet merlin juice are the elves (who of course are all female) which are made apparent by the tattoos on their body. And how do those groups find out if they have these tattoos? By ripping their clothes off of course. Yeah, because giving perhaps a monetary incentive for the elves to come forward or maybe just asking would be too simple. In fact that's how most of this anime plays out: The characters running around the countryside ripping the clothes off of every elf and Vulcan cosplayer in sight. 
The characters who I won't bother mentioning because lets face it: you wouldn't give a shit anyway because you want to see some elf T&A and that torrented hentai copy of ""Viper"" isn't playing on your computer. All you need to know is that their is a buff dude who instigates most of the sexual assaults in this anime and probably by the end of it has a rap sheet long enough to serve life sentences of every criminal in the U.S prison system. A woman who's fond of swords and suffers from an eating disorder. A girl who fires long range assault rifles while in a school uniform (I suppose because she couldn't afford to drop the extra cash on body armor). And a talking panda bear (who is obviously there to help close the diversity gap which this anime badly needed to do) who I couldn't help but call toilet-paper-panda throughout the series the drunker I got watching this shit show. This crack team of idiots in every episode basically drive around in a tank fighting the Street Sharks and hurling elves Team Rocket style into the sun while their clothes rip off so they can get more of that merlin jizz. *sigh* just...just roll with it okay? 
So, why does this quad-squad of crap go through the motions of collecting all this magic? Because they're actually trying to use it to get back to Japan. They're all stuck in this weird ass parallel universe and the only way they can get back is ripping the clothes off elves to find tattoos to collect magic dust so they can snort it up and wake up from an acid-trip coma and be back in the real world again. Directed By M Night Shaymalan.

Is there anything worse than bad-looking fanservice? If you said bad-looking fanservice padded with -- episodes of inexplicable story, you'd be right, and this brings us to Popotan, an early --'s vehicle for breasts and panty shots very loosely inspired by an erotic visual novel by the same name. 
I had very low expectations and ample warning for this show, expecting only said breasts and panty shots with a modicum of light storytelling to carry them. Unfortunately I was to be disappointed even in these very qualified expectations. 
What Popotan is about doesn't matter - the show makes this very clear early on. Yes, there's a larger story about connecting with others which is given undue seriousness for such a light piece of entertainment, but what underpins it is a plot so half-baked you're risking salmonella poisoning by watching it. It's not even clear that the characters are time travelers until about halfway in, but by that point you've likely learned to take the show's storytelling in stride (or better yet dropped it). However, things just get more confusing from then on, with dramatic scenes falling laughably alongside gratuitous nudity for some extra tonal dissonance. Where did these characters come from? Who is the person they're looking for? Why do only two of them appear to be able to use magic? Why does Mai try so hard to befriend an anti-social girl when she knows that she's going to disappear and leave this girl alone, repeating the exact thing she now deeply regrets from a previous point in history? None of these and more will be answered. 
Sadly, for those who can suffer a terrible story for some decent fanservice, the art of Popotan does its best to disappoint here as well. While the character designs themselves are distinct and cute, in motion here they're mediocre at best and sometimes reduced to blocky geometric shapes. Certainly some of the best animation is reserved for the frequent bath scenes, but even here the show fails to deliver consistently. On a side note - it's somewhat remarkable that for such a brazen work that features all of the characters with detailed upper-body nudity in every episode (often more than once) it's surprisingly skimpy when it comes to Mii. 
As for positives? First and foremost is likely the capable voicework of Momoi Haruko as Mii, who is just as nauseatingly (enchantingly?) cute as you'd expect. You also get some nice early --'s atmosphere and a decent soundtrack. The fanservice is also decent when it wants to be, but is probably not worth the price of admission.

Another entry in the ""trapped in a videogame"" premise with a much more literal and sarcastic take on the trend. Without much plot or world-building, Konosuba lacks a cohesive structure and relies heavily on comedy to stay interesting. A little too much fanservice and not enough writing, each episode can become a slog of obvious and drawn-out jokes that somehow always end up with a female character humiliating herself. 
The first two episodes are strong, with lots of unexpected twists and a story build-up that promises a wacky comedy-adventure featuring a cast of quirky, unique characters going on quests and exploring this fantasy world while searching for a way to defeat the evil Demon King. Unfortunately, all plot gets side-barred in the name of endless wish-fulfillment fanservice and obvious jokes that try to convince you they're self-aware and deconstructive by being transparently self-indulgent. 
Kazuma checks off all the boxes of a self-insert main character: apathetic, plain, otaku, social recluse, smarter than average, inexplicably never romantically interested in anyone, and completely essential to the survival of a bunch of powerful girls. He accumulates the usual harem, each with her own quirk that usually manifests as a fetish and who views Kazuma as her leader for no particular reason. They are all walking the edge between living-stereotype and actual-person, with --% of their behavior conforming to a single gimmick and small slices of personality and motivation. 
The characters show flashes of personality and life, when they aren't constantly reinforcing their identities as ""girl who always does that one stupid thing"", and the clashing personalities occasionally make for some great humor. KonoSuba tries to stay self-aware and subvert all the cliches of the shonen-harem-videogame-anime, but it lacks the self-respect to not dump minutes worth of pointless fanservice into every episode while playing the exact same jokes over and over again. It feels just like every other trashy harem anime, instead of the parody of one that it's supposed to be. Rather than being a story about strong characters growing together as a group, developing themselves and exploring their world in true JRPG style, all the while bouncing personalities off each other's and poking fun at videogame tropes, most of the screen time is devoted to showing off insecure girls embarrassing themselves in front of Kazuma and inevitably begging him for help.  
There's a distinct lack of detail that destroys all credibility of the premise. Concepts are constantly brought up and never expanded on, power-levels and abilities are completely arbitrary and inconsistent, random factions and countries are brought in and out of existence for plot-convenience, no one has a backstory, and nothing external to the plot of each episode ever happens. Every quest is stand-alone and insignificant, and the characters never change at all or improve their relationships in the slightest. None of the characters seem to even speak to anyone but Kazuma after they are introduced, unless they are talking about Kazuma, and they don't have any sense of familiarity with one another at all. 
There are a dozen better comedy ecchi shows that have everything KonoSuba has, plus realistic relationships and some level of progression throughout the series, and - frankly - better fanservice. There are some good jokes and cute moments sprinkled throughout, but they aren't worth the ---episode slog of the same harem garbage from every bad anime over and over again.  Good voice acting though

One of the most stupid, illogical and nonsensical anime series ever made. Ever. 
Characters are just puppets in creators hands, they are absolutely shallow. If you are here for a good plot or story, character development, even a little bit of seriousness, then forget about this absurd, called ""Kill la Kill"". However if you want the most infantile show, then 'stay awhile and listen', feel free to watch it. 
Highest imbecility level. If you want even something serious, forget about it, drop it right here right now. Absolute trash and waste of time. That's it.

Spectacular. Simply brilliant. This show says more in -- episodes than others could do in -- seasons. It has this aura that has the watcher questioning so many different things the whole way through. From the characters to the plot, the show asks questions that really make the viewer think. Many of those questions are answered throughout the show, but those answers usually seem flimsy (in a good way). This show has a lot of room for interpretation and it has true philosophical value. That, and it was quite enjoyable and exciting to watch. 
I wanted to leave a fairly short review, because I don't really feel like going too in-depth with this. The show is brilliant, it deserves to be watched. MyAnimeList demands I write a longer review though, so here I am. Watch the show, it's a diamond in the ruff.  
Shinichirō Watanabe is by far the best, most creative, and most intelligent anime director. Everything he makes seems to speak depth and value. From Samurai Champloo to Cowboy Bebop to Death Parade, everything he makes seems to be outstanding.

I've dropped it  
To summarize it: it is an anime with nice visuals, that is ruined by a very badly written story. It is possible to figure out the rough idea of what is going on in the first - minutes of the first episode, and slightly adjust information in the second. 
Detailed breakdown below: 
Story: -/-- 
The story writing is exceptionally poor, and the main issue is that the story writer did not have a good idea about presenting new events. So, when the story needs to introduce you to some sort of idea, characters sit down in a circle and talk for -- minutes. Sometimes they invent ""theories"" out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted. Everything between fights is incredibly dull, and characters - all of them - act almost in the same fashion. Once again, we have ""spineless male protagonist in glasses"", and even though this is not a harem, this kind of character is incredibly annoying. There's ONE surprisingly well done character of a magical girl, but she doesn't get enough screen time. 
Also, dramatic and tragic scenes are handled in surprisingly poor and tasteless fashion.  
In general - huge number of dull scenes, or scenes where somebody explains something for a very long time, plus interactions between characters are incredibly awkward. 
Art: -/--: 
The art is actually fairly good and characters have decent design. There some noticeable instances of CG use, and characters could use a bit more detail, but overall it is decent. 
Sound: -/--: 
Thoroughly mediocre soundtrack, that sometimes gets annoying. The anime features annoying ""jester-type"" villain and when that one was talking on several occasions I've felt disconnect between words and character.  This doesn't happen often in anime, but happened in this case. 
Characters: -/--: 
There's amazingly well done a character of a naive magical girl in the series, who looks genuine in every scene she arrives, and is incredibly sympathetic. However, everybody else is pretty much a carton cutout, and either act in completely stupid way, or follows some sort of cliched role. Interactions between characters are neither believable nor interesting most of the time. ""Protagonist"" is unlikeable, and is a classic ""shy spineless otaku school boy in glasses"" (I hoped this stereotype has died, but guess not). 
Enjoyment: -/--: 
This is a disappointment. The potential of the main idea was high, but poor execution and bad storywriting ultimately ruined it. 
Overall: -/--: 
The best idea is to skip it. Aside from one well done character, there's little reason to watch it. If you're bored out of your mind, perhaps you you'll enjoy fights (plenty of those), but the dull character interactions and very long talking sequences are very likely to kill the fun.

Continuing from where the last movie leaves off, Guts leaves the Band of the Hawk and Griffith is captured. It is now a year later and Guts has returned to save Griffith who is now only beyond a mere shell of his former glory self. Anyway, I say this has been the best movie of the trilogy so far. In context to story, the beginning is very rushed and some scenes are taken out from the original manga and some are properly rearranged. But it doesn't really hurt the flow for the story in relation to the movie. It works in its own way, but I will admit as a manga purist, idealistically, I wish it followed the manga ---% to a t, but that's just me. This movie is now - hours so it allows more content, though I wish all the movies were - hours.  
The controversial CG in my humble opinion, has improved but still has its problems. I say the frame rate is more even and the frame size in proportion to the characters and foreground appropriately accommodates it. It still comes across as ""gamey,"" but it is an improvement, but by no means perfect. The action is very violent and lives up to its bad ass title. There will be plenty of blood and gore. Even though Guts is the main character and a bad ass, I will admit when this guy fights, he scares me and this movie does a good job of making me scared of the main character. There's nothing to fear, but fear itself, but fear fears Guts. On a list of top anime bad asses, Guts has to be on that list no doubt.  
I say what defines the art and animation is how it sets the atmosphere and brings you into the emotions. You feel Griffith's fragility. Even though you don't see him unmasked, the detail to the art on whatever you see of his face is enough to give you an idea of what he would look like if unmasked. You see the hesitation of Guts on whether or not he should leave the Hawks again. You feel Casca's frustrations. I feel that the raw emotions bring a sense of substance in conjunction to its R---+ (the equivalent to an NC--- in America) rating.  
The voice acting, as I have admitted in previous reviews, has been an issue for me. I will admit that Guts' new actor has shown improvement and shown instances that he can capture the character. But I will openly admit as a purist and fanboy that Nobutoshi Canna is still Guts to me while Michael Bell will always be his English voice to me. The guy who plays Jedau does an ok imitation of the character's original voice actor, Ishida Akira. Maybe for people not familiar with the previous anime series and the games will not find this to be an issue and may like the voice actors. 
Like the second movie, the soundtrack is more acoustics and orchestrated. My thoughts on that carry onto this movie as well. It suits the time period very well and knows how to suit the atmosphere. The orchestra in the ending credits was very impressive. Susumu Hirakawa still does the opening theme and is my favorite part of the soundtrack. Still, like the newer voice cast, fans new to Berserk who had not seen the previous anime series or played the games will probably not think of this as an issue.   
The closest thing to a spoiler I can give is that after the ending credits, there is a post credits scene which isn't much for some people, but after that is over, there is a message in clear English that says ""This is only the beginning"" meaning we will get new Berserk movies. I say its only natural with the easter eggs in previous movies, this series deserves its shot where it really shines. For those not familiar with the Berserk manga, this new trilogy is a mere fraction of what Berserk has to offer. So I hope we hear more news soon if a new Berserk movie will come out this year or not.  
After that, we get a bonus music video!!! So fans will most likely enjoy this.

At first I was baffled what kind of anime is S&amp;W and would it leave an impression on me when I watched it. Happily enough, it did and with a fresh genre that it introduced for today's generation. 
Story: --/-- 
Making a breakthrough using &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;trade&quot; as the main theme, it is a fresh approach that was injected to the mostly underrated medieval theme anime series without the fancy mahou or sword-and-damsels-in-distress approach. The story would be slow at first but will pick-up for most -st time watchers. 
Art: -/-- 
IMAGIN studio did a great work in making this series to suit a medieval atmosphere for the viewer. The graphic and art is very good with the golden fields of wheat to the dark forests of the countryside that makes one to be fully absorbed into it. 
Sound: -/-- 
As I expected, orchestral music was used to simulate the theme for the anime and it was very good although it was a bit tedious that they would re-use them most of the time as the series progresses. The OP and ED theme fitted the theme and gives you a mellow and warm feeling. 
Character: -/-- 
HORO~! Well, who could love or hate her? Lawrence too and some of the other characters in the series. Although character development was not much of a factor, their expressions and attitude are enough to entice us to either love OR hate them in a way. ^__^ 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
I rarely enjoy a SHORT anime series such as S&amp;W but it did for me. Most of the feeling comes from Lawrence and Horo arguing to each other and of course the trades of being a merchant. What lacks maybe is more romanticism since medieval themed ones like this is all about romance. 
Overall: -/-- 
A great series BUT TOO DAMN SHORT, Spice and Wolf is definitely a very good series to watch not because of its exquisite art or marketing, but how the author was able to create a fresh genre of &quot;economic anime&quot; that would surprise even for me who watches them for a long time.

So I just finished Mirai Nikki today, I was bored and searching for a good anime, and find Mirai Nikki. I already heard of this anime before, but doesn't know what it is about. So I looked about it, and turns out it's about a survival game and I like that kind of genre so I try watching it without looking at everyone reviews. 
( Spoiler ahead, and don't hate this is just my opinion ) 
The first episode was okay, it's kinda like hunger games where there will only be - person who survive in the end. Hunger games was pretty cool so I thought Mirai Nikki will be good. 
Well it's not...... The story is about Yukiteru and Yuno be friend and then he hates her, and then he forgive her and then hates her again. REALLY?! Like can you not, the girl is psycho how can you be so stupid, okay I want to continue this review later. 
[ STORY ]  - 
Average for me, the plot was good but the end was bad in my opinion. Well except that everyone had a happy ending ( I meant people in the third world, people in the other world died so... ) I almost cried when I watch the ending, but the scene when Yukiteru is in the God's world? I don't know where he is, well he was looking at his phone and reading his diary, this scene made the ending disappointing, I mean just show that everyone is happy in the end and just end the anime already.

I don't have anything to say, the art is good. So I'm giving it an -.

I don't like both opening lol, I don't hate it, it's just not good in my opinion. The ending was not bad tho. 
[ CHARACTER ]  - 
Okay where do I start.. 
Amano Yukiteru 
I kinda hate him honestly. Especially the part where he shot Hinata, Akise and the others. Like what the hell dude, they were honest with you, BUT no you are just a selfish piece of shit who only believe in Yuno till the end. Other than that part he was okay lol. 
Yuno Gasai 
She's a psycho. I know.. her mother treat her bad and Yukiteru died in the first world, maybe it's too much for her. BUT seriously? she's creepy as hell. I don't get why Yukiteru still want to be near her after everything she has done. I don't think any guy want to be with a girl like her, I mean she's scary man. I don't hate her tho, she's just weird... 
Uryuu Minene 
One of my favorite definitely, my favorite girl character in Mirai Nikki. I don't really like her in her first apperance, but after that she was really dope! And a tsundere too lol makes her interesting, I really ship her with Nishijima lol, when she first met him I was like really excited. She's probably one of the reason I still continue watching this anime. 
Akise Aru 
My favorite character and THE ONLY reason why I watched Mirai Nikki till the end. First of all, c'mon how can you not like him? He's really cool and smart, and turns out to be a nice guy who's (gay?) lol I meant who wants to help his friend Yukiteru. 
[ ENJOYMENT ]  - 
I was just curious about the story, like who's the third body that Yuno killed and what's the ending gonna be like. Don't really enjoy the anime, although I REALLY enjoy Uryuu x Nishijima scene. 
[OVERALL ]  - 
Don't know.. I don't really like this anime, definitely not worth watching twice. Don't want to recommend people to watch it too. I don't hate it, it's just sucks. 
This is my first review, sorry if it sucks or made you mad if you think Mirai Nikki is good. Well people have different opinion and this is mine.

I started watching the series because it sounded similar to a story idea that I had previous to hearing about the series. Honestly, if it had turned out to be exactly the same as what I had imagined I might've enjoyed it more, but as it seems they were two very different ideas. The concept of a friendly ghost within a series is always pretty intriguing as it can be used as a very good way to flesh out a character who feels ""haunted"" or perhaps literally is haunted. Anohana was the latter, and the protagonist was being followed around by a childhood friend of his who, in case you haven't realized it, died when she was young. The girls name is Meiko and she has returned because she has unfinished business and needs help figuring out what needs to be done in order to grant her wish and let her enter the afterlife. The series must cover some pretty sensitive stuff and touch the audience's heart in a very emotionally connecting way, right? Not really. 
Anohana set itself up to fail as a series that makes Meiko out to be ""the girl that everyone loves"", ""every girl wants to be Meiko"", ""every boy wants to date Meiko"", among other ridiculous things. This wouldn't have been so bad if they had at least explained WHY everybody liked her so much or at least toned down a bit. It seems as if they assumed the audience wouldn't have been sad about a child dying unless they stress how popular she was, which isn't really true. A simple ""our childhood friend died and it all upset us because she was so young and we all cared about her"" would've sufficed instead of the dragged-on parade about how great she was and how jealous everybody was of this literal toddler.  
When a character like Meiko gets set up to be the greatest human to have ever lived, it's kind of like a pie in the face when you are actually introduced to her. She isn't that great, she is very annoying, and it is hard to feel bad for her when things go wrong because of these things. However, Meiko isn't exclusive to being the only annoying character in the series. All the other characters except for Tetsudou seem to be malicious for absolutely no reason. Like at worst if you bring up a dead loved one, the surrounding people will either get quiet, maybe get a bit angry or ask you to change the topic. No, these characters go as far as pranking the protagonist into thinking she is still alive by dressing up as her and wandering the woods for a few days JUST BECAUSE they are ""so angry"" with the protagonist for bringing her up after all those years. In case you happen to be new to this world, that is what we call ""over the top"" and ""not very believable"". Honestly the scene was supposed to be sad but I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it was. But it doesn't end there. 
Romance seems to be thrown into the series randomly which, not to be blunt, shouldn't have been a priority in a story that starts with a group of - year olds. In fact, the reason Meiko dies has something to do with romance that is once again hard to believe and not that sad. There is a subtle romance between every guy and Meiko, and a jealous fit between every girl and Meiko that I personally didn't care about. At all. The amount of times characters literally say ""I wanted to be her"" is unsettling and obsessive to a point where I can't really say I liked any of the characters. But referring back to my main point, the romance was wishy washy, pointless and I would've preferred literally anything else in its place. 
After an enormous amount of time getting the characters to all sit in one room together without explosive amounts of drama, they get together to accomplish the one wish that Meiko wants. It takes a lot of time, money, effort and quite a bit of screen time but they eventually finish it and find out that it wasn't what Meiko wanted. But luckily, the characters grew closer as friends because of the bond they rebuilt making this big waste of time and are now all friends again....WRONG. They once again go back to bickering. It kind of makes you wonder if they would've stayed friends anyway regardless of if Meiko had lived or not. I won't give spoilers but the series ends with everything all wrapped up and everything is fine again, but a lot of the series gives off the vibe of ""was this all worth the effort?"" to which the answer was usually ""no"". 
To wrap up a big review I'll just say this series, in my opinion, was much like Meiko. Advertised as the literal greatest thing to have ever walked the earth... but ended up being annoying and played out for too long.

First episode: -/-- (incredible for hentai) 
Second episode: -/-- (regular for hentai) 
Final score: -/-- (disappointing but worth checking) 
When I started the -st episode I expected porn. the premise seemed slightly interesting about a guy that works in a video store, has a rape fetish and meets a girl with supposed-magical-powers that can sense if other girls want to be raped. The whole idea of girls wanting to be raped (thus not making it rape), a boy that wants to ""rape"" (even if it might not be rape) and a sidekick GIRL that guides him through to get his desires all made an interesting premise to me but I wouldn't expect a common hentai to try and examine those ideas. 
Contrary to my expectations the whole -st episode was much more about characters, comedy and dialogue rather than sex. Even the climatic sex scene feels more about story and characters rather than just plain porn. I found Chidori, the main girl, to be interesting, stronger and smarter than the usual hentai girl and the whole question whether she really wants to be raped or not made the whole situation intriguing and on a higher level than the average hentai. 
I was expecting the second episode to further explore the characters and topics the first episode set up - does Ippei really want to ""rape""? Does it change anything to him knowing the girls want it as much as he does? Does the girls really want to get raped? Why?? Where does Sari got her powers from? Are they true?? How does the Chidori story arc ends? What did she do after the rape? What does she and Ippei feel for each other now?? 
Well none of those questions get any answers. In fact the second episode throws everything the first episode builds. Chidori does not even appear in the second episode! This is really annoying and strange since even Sakura, which was way weaker and less interesting as a character then Chidori appears in both episodes. 
It feels like the writers and director of the first episode left the production completely, the second episode is as average hentai as it can get and really does not fit as a sequel to the first one. Ippei even lacks his naive stress and anxiety which made him likable and he just comes off as a bad and hateful person. I think both episodes would've benefit had they been stand alone, but I think the -st episode really deserves a continuation which sadly we will not receive. 
As a hentai that felt more like a shounen romance with funny characters and somewhat taboo and intriguing subjects this pretty much could've been revolutionary, but the second episode holds it back from being so. perhaps in the future there would come a show which would be able to be hentai without neglecting its writing and characters.

This series is quite old, and yet no so much; it would seem vintage but it is only an apperance. 
The show itself you might say is progressing quite slowly and yet it would seem to be going in its own pace, not slow yet not brief and taken straight to the point. the combination of the music genre of blues and jass along the show, the lack of many flashy events and effects.. it has only made me to think that all of that was meant to make this a monument the these music genre, slow and quiet yet beautiful. 
This was defenitely one of the best animes i have ever watched, not the first but absolutely it owns its spot in one of the highest ranking along all of my exprience as an otaku.

The tragedy of Icarus, so artistically applied in this series, comes to mind whenever I think of"" Fullmetal Alchemist"". A series that broke away from the original story, and generated an eclipsing fan base, only to be smacked down by the steady hand of reality. You might hate me for saying this, but allow me to justify myself. 
Story: -/-- 
What might have been...the story was great, initially. It sought to take a story that was still in development, change it, and make something new out of it, in other words Alchemy! It is intriguing, inquisitive, full of great action, while not failing to lose track of it's philosophical motive of being... for the most part. 
Unfortunately this story has the same failing as ""the Matrix"" trilogy. The dilemma in the Matrix was if you know one world to be reality, then suddenly, that reality is pulled out from under your feet and you find a new reality, how can you ever be sure you are truly experiencing reality, since you couldn't tell before. Of course they were completely unable to answer such a question so they shifted to pure action and romance... 
The same thing happened with FMA. They asked What is Alchemy if the law of equivalent exchange can be bent, or even broken! Then similarly could not answer such a question so they shifted to pure  action and romance. The dilemma they proposed began to eat away at what was left of their plot, and there you have it, the tragedy of Icarus. 
Art: --/-- 
Outstanding art. The story truly bothered me but that didn't stop me from loving the animation and wonderful (especially considering the time) effects. The characters are well made and backgrounds are not at all constant. 
Sound: --/-- 
Both subbed and dubbed voices are good, I enjoyed the dubbed better. The Openings are both very enjoyable. The endings are so-so, but they make up for that with special endings. Such as plot changing events having their own special endings, very well done. The sound track is perfect for the series and fits everything well. 
Character: -/-- 
The brothers are done perfectly, splendid job on them. Winry and The old lady are done great as well. My problem lies with the Homunculi, their entire reason for bearing the name they do is cut out of the series, not to mention sloth is non existent, replaced by a homunculus who is definitely not slothful...- sins remember, not -. I don't mind them being changed around a bit, but I wish it was a bit more coherent. Another issue I have is Primary supports seem to simply disappear, and reappear whenever it seems most convenient, without even a plot device. What i really did appreciate in this series is the role of villain is spread far and wide, which is difficult to do, but they pulled it off well. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Despite all of the plot holes I really did enjoy watching this series. and admittedly I didn't see them until I watched Brotherhood. So despite all this criticism, it definitely is worth a watch if you like shonen, and are into science, a little. The majors like me should stay away, you'll end up picking out flaws like this and ruin the series for yourself. 
Truly a tragedy of a series...but know that I've graded it much harsher than I normally would, because of it's undeserved (in my opinion) rise to fame.

Dear Fellow Otaku and Anime lovers,  
I have seen a lot of harem animes but this one was just a little plain, the last episode was so boring I basically skipped through the whole episode. For me, it usually doesn't take me long to fall in love with an anime but this anime was just not exciting, it would good for anyone who likes fantasy video games, like sword art online, (I'm not talking shit about that anime) but it had the same theme, I felt like I never really got to know the characters. I'm not saying it was bad, I just prefer a grow character development. With this anime, I don't feel that. Would I watch this if I just wanted a good action anime sure but, nothing more.

INTRO 
================= 
It has always intrigued me how zombies or flesh eating humans has not made much of a presence in the anime industry. There were shows like Highschool of the Dead (and that turned into a fanservice horsecrap), Hellsing (mostly vampires but there was and an arc which featured great zombie actions), Sankarea (which mainly focuses on romance and hope), Ore was zombie desu ka (which was quite an oddity but its one of those shows that I can watch for pure stupid fun!), and a couple more. There was really no show in this genre that has truly captivated me; then came Tokyo Ghouls...at least I first thought it would. 
================= 
THE REVIEW 
================= 
The series started off great. You have this normal college student named Kaneki who has a crush on this girl who share the same interest as him. All is good and well when shit quickly hits the fan and he ended up becoming a zombie; not just an ordinary zombie but one that is self-aware and has an unrelenting appetite to human flesh. It was great how the series tries to explore the dilemmas that a ghoul has to go through in his everyday life and how the everything is not as it seems. 
The show was great until Ep - came. Everything just went so effin fast. The show introduced this psycho who wants to be more than friends with kaneki. The episode started off from exploring different character scenes and the psycho trying to woo kaneki over and within a couple of minutes they end in this arena slaughterhouse. It goes worse as the series went on and the last minutes of the final episode just puts that nail in the coffin. 
The pacing is just so terrible that it's hard to sympathize with the character's plight. The one saving grace this show had is the last episode where they showed Kaneki's inner monologue. Now that is great way to show a character's state of mind. It is a huge disappointment and a wasted potential as I feel that Tokyo Ghoul is one of those character study shows all the while showing some great action scenes. There is just so many things happening to coherently fit into a - cour show. It was only until Ep - that I found out that there was a manga. Reviews on it has been pretty positive and I have seen that it was also recently finished so I am going to start reading it soon. 
Let's not also forget the censorship. Oh GOD! THE CENSORSHIP!! There are freaking times when the screen gets cut in half or just fades to black and all you hear is the audio. For god's sake! Studio Pierrot knows that this is a mature show aimed at an adult audience so why the fuck are you guys doing this? I will not be surprised if they end up removing those in BR just to boost its sales and  that will be very underhanded, man. 
================= 
VERDICT 
================= 
The art style and premise got me intrigued; the direction of the show made me wince. So, to finally wrap things up I will now be giving a final score which comprises the built-in scoring system coupled with my personal bias and a fairly complicated process of wiping my lips clean with a tissue smeared with aromatic blood after taking a sip at a bloody testicle juice mixed  with a straw made from dried human intestines makes me want to give Tokyo Ghoul a score of.. 
-.-/--! 
A show with potential hampered by the production staff and dubious marketing strategies. Fans of the genre will be left hanging by the noose and is advised to look for their craving somewhere else. If you don't mind horrible pacing and extreme censorship you can stay for the action which is still pretty good.

Digimon is one of my guilty pleasure anime. Sure it has enough predictable elements: several children are on a journey where they see various monsters a la Pokemon, Digimon are beaten to the point of defeat until their owner finds the power within to give them a boost to beat their enemies like many past generic action titles, and the enemies are shallow villains with no redeemable qualities with a desire to rule either the Digital World and/ or the human world. The English dub for it is also laughably bad at many points with Saban peppering in enough cheesy lines and jokes in its silly attempts to make this series accessible to younger American audiences when it came out in the late ----s. 
What sets Digimon apart from Pokemon though is the depth given to the human characters and how this affects the relationships they share with both their friends and Digimon partners. All of these children have their own inner doubts and backgrounds that affect who they are and how they act in front of others. Throughout their journey, the children undergo their own coming-of-age experiences which allow them to come to terms with their inner doubts. This fares better than Pokemon which is focused too much on Satoshi/ Ash's neverending Pokemon master journey and the various relationships the trainers have with their Pokemon. 
Visually, Digimon Adventure --'s artwork isn't anything to scream out loud about. Character designs looked kind of plain and rather simple, especially with human characters. It's also pretty noticeable that there are reused animated clips now and then considering the long length of the series. 
Digimon's character depth stood out for me in the pool of anime titles used in promoting children's video or trading card games. It's not groundbreaking in anyway, but I wouldn't mind watching it now and then.

The anime is truly fantastic but it has the drawback that I felt made Hajime no Ippo just as frustrating... No matter how strong and powerful the main character gets they still act like a damn coward!!! They could be in a match -- episodes into the series with TONS of training and TONS of determination and then once the match starts they CRUMBLE like all they have worked hard for is forgotten and they SHRINK in their shells wishing for some shit to happen! It truly hurts these anime in my opinion. Of course the saving grace is the end where they ""recall a memory"" or they ""see the struggle of others around them trying their hardest"" and they eventually crawl out of their shell and help the team win. HOWEVER after seeing this same approach to every single damn match, as the viewer, you become upset when the main character said he would try his best the day before but when it comes to the start of the game they revert back to their cowardice ways. After -- episodes Sena needs to grow a pair of balls and run with the idea that he can't let his team down as their Ace!!! I don't mind him being timid and afraid as Sena but when that Eyeshield comes on he needs to become a man and lead his team to victory!

The battle tournament/ survival game genre is something that always catches my interest due to it's massive potential. It's a quick and sure-fire way to have epic battles, dynamic characters and a thrilling ride of suspense. Even an average writer could make a good survival story. A terrible writer, however, can only produce garbage. Hand shakers could very well be the worst anime to Grace this genre. 
Let's get straight to the elephant in the room: the art and animation. I don't understand how Gohands( what is it with Japan and weird names?) Could produce something as beautiful as k project then make this dumpster fire. The show tried so hard to be advant garde by combining -d and -d animation but the director hadn't the slightest clue what to do. The CG is painfully poorly rendered to the point there are ps- games with better graphics  There's also the poorly handled camera that just spins around without any real meaning. I'm guessing the director was going for a cinematic feel but it felt like the show was made by a child playing with his phone. Viewers are bombarded with oversaturated rainbow vomit colors you can find on a bad Wattpad faction cover. More colors don't mean better art If there's no rhyme or reason put into it. Some people even claimed to have gotten nauseous from these pathetic visuals. I'll admit the actual character designs were good and I liked the outfit worn by the mc. His jacket is chic and looks good enough to be sold in fashion retails. 
The soundtrack was completely dull. Not a single song stuck out to me and I forgot every piece of music as soon as it ended. I understand not every anime can get that Iwasaki Taku or Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack but at least have something noteworthy in the audio-visual department to distract viewers from the clusterf*ck story. I liked the voice acting in the English dub and I would've never watched this boring show with subtitles so that's one positive I guess. 
Time to finally get to the real meat of the show. Or maybe it's vegan meat cause it's completely bland boring and a utter waste of time.  
( Cue dramatic narration in the voice of Optimus Prime) 
Fierce opponents from all across Japan battle to enlist in a legendary tournament to own the right to talk to God. The battles are daunting and survival is not guaranteed. Only one boy and his basic bitch girlfriend may come out supreme. 
( End credits) 
And that's the entire show in one paragraph. Episodes either have bland mc and basic bitch go on a date or have them battling other fighters. Let's take a quick look at the setup.  Why are the weapons here called nimrods? I understand the old definition means mighty Hunter( I researched it so the show indirectly taught me a new meaning) most people would immediately think of an idiot. What's also idiotic is why the area these teens fight in is called a ziggurat. It's another biblical term that refers to a temple. These people are never in a temple so calling an empty space a ziggurat is stupid and pretentious. I just know the writers thought they were being clever with the naming. Anime has this weird fascination with using religious terms simply to look cool without any thought put into it. 
There isn't a lot to say about the story since this show is as superficial as it gets. It's utterly cluttered with archetypes and badly animated fights. Let's make a list of the cliches shall we 
• Emotionless quiet girl 
• quirky scientist 
• Laid back parents who don't question the obvious 
• sadist and masochist duo 
• pop idol 
• a loli who's actually an adult 
There's more but you get the point.  The dynamic between the characters felt drier than the devil's ass. Tazuna wants to protect hiyori cause she looks like his dead sister and hiyori wants......???????  Other contestants include a brocon sister who wants to be by her brother's side forever, a pop idol who wants to remain in fame and a businesswoman who wants to be taken seriously. With motives and personalities so boring, it's hard to care who wins and losses. 
What's worse is that the entire tournament was for nothing. Tazuma wins but he never talked to God.  Thanks for cementing your complete lack of skill dear writers. we never get to find out anything about this god and the show ends. 
I don't recommend watching hand shakers. You might have fun laughing at how bad it is but the atrocious visuals and lackluster cast make it hard to sit through.

Terror in Resonance: 
MINDSET: 
Explosions, derpy faces, amazing animation and overly hyped. Its devoid of realism and don't think outside the box... 
REVIEW: 
According to Collins dictionary terrorism is: 
The systematic use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends. 
By using this evidence, do I remember any casualties from innocent civilians? No. Even if You may think that there were at least some deaths during the show, they never had the courtesy to at least show some death sequences or just anyone dying as if everyone was plot armoured, and when we do gotten to do the point when people are dying, it felt cheap as if the writers never noticed they should even have casualties. 
So even the show that centres around “Terrorism” looks and centres more around just blowing sh*t up. It was obvious right from the get go that the two protagonists needed to launch a nuclear bomb at Tokyo, Consequently, right at the first few minutes of the Anime, we see them successfully stealing plutonium without getting caught and instead of even planning to create a nuclear bomb but all what they did was screw around with the police with riddles and demolishing a couple of skyscrapers without even killing anyone! 
Character motives are just way too value or feels like it happened for no reason at all. Like why are these people terrorists in the first place? Seriously, You cannot really link up why and how this whole terrorism thing even started! Their were characters who barely get any fleshing out and feel like backdrop. Like the police force who seem to have an important role to the plot yet the show has never really felt that these supporting roles have a larger meaning or have good character exploration for us to even care! The side cast was completely forgettable as one guy only speaks English in the most Asian way possible and who even cares about such people or anyone in that matter? 
Plot device characters are surprisingly everywhere in the Anime, but even if the role was there and the character is grasped well, how can we care? No one ever develops as if we were to show our sympathy at the end. Token girl of the two terrorists was unnecessary, she doesn’t have a role to the plot, she doesn’t even help out the characters emotionally or physically and we never even knew why she's so emo in the first place, since all what she does is look sad! Overall, the cast was an absolute train wreck. 
Sure before the unholy revival of the -th episode it did felt like a good show with how it handles the story. Of course society mass panicked from the extreme vandalism, the police was actually doing something. Though the riddles that the terrorists set up were just plain silly like trying to figure out some cryptic Greek myth to find some number that will lead the police force to enemy HQ  felt more hip and cool like a beta version of Death Note. Yes, characters were still terrible at that time, but it seem to contain more self-awareness any ways. 
When the show attempts to create some epic revelation twist as a pathetic attempt to blow everyone’s mind, it feels more like stuff being made up along the spot rather than something that feels organic. In this one moment when we reveal the master mind whose behind through most of the weird causes in the show we instead found that it was just one of the detectives friend who committed suicide... Yeah, epic revelation guys I sure had an asthma attack after that one... 
At this fifth episode we see the show completely collapsing  into itself when he reveal a psycho chick whose only personality is just to be a Yandere, but also: We some of the most asian and most downright cheesiest and the most unmoralistic use of “Engrish” in  a damn while! I know these people are meant to be American and this Asian Psycho has to speak English for them to understand, but its still a thousand times better just to leave all of those scenes in just Japanese; I can't help but to utterly face palm and feel ear raped every time I hear it!  
Though that is not the biggest of my issues, its when the show decided to hit the mind blow fest, and throw in a bunch of random details of the story that don't add up to anything, and even if it does somehow make sense, it still felt cheap or more importantly some random sh*t where supposed to care about, but ends up being pretentious. As if it was so cheap for the reason why psycho chick was psycho was because she was drugged in school. Can't I ever be more uncaring for such a plot device? 
Overall, for something that is meant to be some intense mystery thriller, its horrible, since we don't care about the characters and too many of them feeling like a plot device or just there for absolutely f**k all. The show is classified as “GOOD” until you pass episode -, and I did enjoy it for what its worth in a certain extent. Consequently, the show ends up not being bad, but another mediocrity because of that factor alone. 
Since I never cared about the show, fans were trying to speak at how this show has a “Political Message” yes, even if its excactly true on whatever the show tries to conceptualise, like how making a school for uber smart people so they can farm their genes that will save the needless problems in Japanese society, was presented  too subtlety! Yes they somehow vaguely explained it, but even if it was obvious, the reasons just don't really feel natural, and is more of a pretentious arse pull! And even if the message was handled well enough for us to get it, I still cant help but to not care, due to badly directed characters and story. 
MAPPA is one of those Animation companies that don't really make the best kind of Animation, well its either mediocre or above average, and they did Animated Hajime No Ippo for whatever that fighting show is worth. Any ways, it was very clear that MAPPA allowed there Animators some fun and creative freedom while still dumping cash bags of savings to make some of the most consistent and well made backgrounds. There is this feeling when there’s a lack of CGI, which is always a plus side and despite of them using a lot of greys, it does make a nift contradiction with some bright colours thrown in whenever someone is outside. The character designs still range to pretty good, or just plain cheap! Like one of the police men having massive eyes and how he's part of the supporting cast. However, most of them give this feeling to synchronize with the whole themes of the show regardless if it was presented badly. How the camera just moves a bit from time to time for no apparent reason is a nice touch, and there were moments like the Ferris Wheel scene when I just want to feel at least some emotion just because it was choreographed so well. Clearly, there has been a lot of thought put into this. 
The OST has a strange vibe to it feeling rather unfitting for this kind of show, but it somehow blends well with the whole terrorist thing with crazy visuals. They do use mainstream instruments like the guitar and piano to an extent, but my main issue is that its just too ambitous for me to gladly listen to on a structured basis. It is an OST that feels very odd, it gives You this bizarre, yet somewhat emotional impact. It is clearly one of those OST's that You need to listen by Yourself to get the gist of what people say about it. The OP, does fit in well with the OST, and sure it doesn’t get me excited, but the visual choreography is just a creative use for us to get into a weird mood. The ED is skip worthy, but it is very calm if You'd like to listen to it. 
LEGACY: 
Its always going to be the Animation of how people will remember such an over hyped mediocrity. Its always going to be the damn budget that I will forever remember on how aesthetically  pleasing it was. Even if everyone says that its good, I believe it won't be long until more and more people will cough up to downgrade the overall score... 
SCORES: 
-.-/-- – The characters have nothing but to fill a one or two dimensional personality, and some of them are complete plot devices or just there or no reason. 
-/-- – Its cool just to see the it until episode -, when the story being on of the redeeming factors collapses into itself. 
-.-/-- – A great mix of very creative choreography and a crazy budget that stays consistent. 
-/-- – The music is refreshing from the common OST, but its a bit too bizarre for me. 
FINALE: -.-/-- – Its a lousy piece of sh*t if it wasn’t for the budget.

So... this movie happened. And, as I had anticipated, I did not enjoy it. It's unfortunate because I love the Godzilla franchise, honestly. Even the goofy movies where he's doing wrestling moves. 
Story: -/-- 
So, the story is that a bunch of Kaiju popped up on Earth one day, forcing humanity to go into space to seek another planet. Eventually, the last of humanity decides to just return to Earth, believing that Godzilla and Co. would probably be dead by now (like a few thousand Earth years had passed by the time they decided to go back. All in all, it's not a very good story (which doesn't really affect the final score because Godzilla movie plots are deep as a kiddy pool, usually). It's little more than a vessel to move the plot and to allow for some Kaiju action. 
Art: -/-- 
This movie looks TERRIBLE! Outside of a select few ""passable"" looking Godzilla scenes, it looks like an unreleased PlayStation- game cinematic. The decision to make the entire thing CG was very poor. I don't expect it to look like something out of MadHouse, but good lord is it hard on the eyes. The sad thing is, the movie could have been redeemed if the art was halfway decent. I've seen better stuff animated in MMD. 
Sound: -/-- 
The sound is actually alright. I watched the dubbed version and it was above what you generally get. The music was also decent. Really gave off that godly vibe when the choir kicked in during the Godzilla scenes. Outside of Godzilla's atomic breath making a dubstep BWAAA noise, there isn't much to complain about when it comes to audio. 
Characters: -/-- 
The characters were fine, and you understood their motivations well enough. It's a shame the artstyle was so godawful I had genuine difficulty differentiating between them, at times. Otherwise, not a terrible cast of characters (just don't go in expecting them to be memorable).  
My overall enjoyment: -/-- 
At the end of the day, even if this is technically apart of a series I love, I can't look past the flaws. Even if everything is hovering around mediocrity, the animation just drags the whole thing down. In a visual medium like animation, a lot of the enjoyment comes out of the art, which is just awful here. Seriously, get a better studio to produce one of these next time. Not recommended.

There’s something that really grabbed me when I began watching samurai flamenco and I think it was its charming blend of humor and realism. But the charm just petered out when the show decided to do a ---% overhaul in tone and thought process. While the initial realism still can be seen fossilized in some of the satirical ideas and jokes throughout the series, they’re overall very thinly spread. I want to tell you that this is anime Kick-Ass but it’s just not. The show’s opportunity to be a brilliant satire or at least meta-commentary of superheroes is sprinkled throughout, but the end result of action and pointless, unfulfilling arcs soars over the simplicity that made the show good to begin with.  
The sound and the aesthetics of the show do their job as good as they can, but should be mentioned for doing an admirable job being there. SF suffers from being one of the shows that repeats background music as mercilessly as its bland villains. Interestingly enough the battle and villain music are repeated the most, making a lot of the fights seem more repetitive and grating given the repetition of the writing too. I will say both openers were appropriate given the rising action of the first half and the continued action of the second half. The openings do the best part of showcasing the character’s goals and dreams, honestly better than the rest of the show did. And while little breaks the mold in terms of art and story, the openings honestly did the best at showcasing the ideas and character design the creators wanted to happen in early, better thought out, and less rushed drafts of the entire project. 
The plot for sure rises and builds on itself, but its sequence of events is plotted like an erratic heart rate. Jesus Christ I felt like I should have called a doctor on episodes - and -- because the plotting was going into cardiac arrest. The shifts in what the show wants to do with its plotting are so janky they’re feats in and of themselves. Yes samurai flamenco goes to fight the forces of evil, but Masaoshi stops growing as a person when monsters start falling out of the sky and wreaking havoc. This again shows the unsure and lofty goals of the anime. Masaoshi grows and is a hyperbolic but interesting little soul, but never grows out of that, nor does his team. Goto’s subplot of lost love is by far the most interesting, but even the way the show explores it towards the end isn’t fully realized. The way he copes with his past is interesting and yanks on your heart strings without mercy. It’s something that could have been put throughout the show rather than squeezed in during the third arc of the series.  
The characters personality traits are more a rogue’s gallery of quirks that never really go anywhere or influence action or decision-making plot points in the show. I liked that in the beginning Goto immediately has a conflict of interest between his job and helping someone he saved. Mari’s conceited character became more so when she has a chance to hone it as the first of the flamenco girls and she grows in the beginning. But as soon as the show’s tone escalates from a contemporary setting to a larger-than-life superhero setting, the character development flatlines and doesn’t get better. Sure Masaoshi develops better bonds with the characters around him, but that gets him a spare tool from Jun that might work in one situation or moral support from Jouji in another. There’s not a lot of deep or complex staying power in the bonds that he develops with the other characters. The only time it happens is in the climax with Goto, and even then the resolution turns into a ridiculous naked joke. I wanted all of this to be better but it just tried to do so many things and missed all of its marks.

Picking up directly from The Egg of the King, the second part of the Golden Age Arc, The Battle of Doldrey notably ramps up the combat as compared to the first film, and also a serious amount of character development for the main three characters, most notably Guts and Casca. The CGI, however, still remains a mixed bag. 
On the topic of the CGI, there isn't much more to be said as compared to my last review - the CGI is still a very much mixed bag. However, it seems to have improved compared to the last film - it looks much better compared to the Egg of the King, as the CGI is very suited to the large-scaled, individual-heavy Battle of Doldrey. It, however, does not look as good for scenes such as Guts vs the --- Swordsmen. The -D animation, however, is still at a very, very high standard. 
Moving on to story, the film feels very much like the middle chapter of a trilogy. When it comes to the main story, not a huge amount happens. For the world of Berserk, a couple of important events happen, but what really shines is the development of the characters, namely of the main three. 
Casca, whilst still a major character in the first film, gets her background and mentality explored within the second film. We find out early on that she tries no matter what odds are against her to be Griffith's sword - despite her own femine aspects that hold her back. She falls to her own physiology early on, and it is clear, from her own mouth, that she detests the fact that she was born a woman. It's clear not only from her inability to be constantly at the peak of her power, but due to her backstory, where she was the almost-victim of a sexual assault. 
Guts, on the other hand, simply gets more development to continue the development from the first film - Griffith's words on 'true friends' continue to ring in his ears, and it's wonderful how the film potrays Guts' reaction to this. We constantly see Guts distracted, thinking of simply -why- he is fighting for the Band of the Hawk, and for Griffith, even during his battle against --- enemy swordsman. His 'duel' in the final act of the film is a fantastic scene of the film, as Guts decision is made clear, and how resolute Griffith is in 'keeping' Guts is - but what Griffith's intentions are, is not clear. 
Finally, we come to Griffith. At this point (I am yet to view the third film, The Advent) we really do not know what goes on in Griffith's mind. However, we see several scenes that provide us an insight to his mind; his discussion with the enemy General at the Battle of Doldrey shows that he is prepared to do anything to help the Band of the Hawk, and to further his own ambition. But we also gain some idea of his view of Guts. His reaction to Guts decision at the end of the film is extremely interesting, and leads us to wonder, why? Why does Griffith do something (trying to avoid spoilers) like he did, even though he has ambition on the line?  
Finally, it should be noted that the producers and writers upped the ante when it came to the brutality of not only the combat, but the explicit nature of the world of Berserk - scores of men die during the film, and Guts himself takes on around a hundred men by himself - limbs and heads and (hehe) guts line the forest after his battle. One man shreds four other men and their horses at the same time. Pretty crazy stuff. It's also surprising how the sexual content has been upped as well, but not in a titillating way. Casca is almost the victim of sexual assault several times, and there is an somewhat explicit sex scene at the end of the film.  
Of course, I know this is only the very tip of Berserk's mature content. 
Berserk, Golden Age Arc: The Battle for Doldrey is very much a better film then then it's predecessor; the CGI is better utilized, the characters are explored more, and the story is going in a very interesting direction. It is admitted that the CGI is not fantastic, and the core story did not have a lot going for it, but there is still one more film to go, and judging by the chilling preview, I've very much got something to look forward to.

Just appalling. Just an immense disappointment about how the story flowed through until the end. The story felt forced after episode --. I mean, don't get me wrong I would have rated this anime near the upper -'s if the entire anime hadn't changed so drastically. 
Here is the background to my decision.. 
The story begins with a boy in school. Nothing too special going on with his life, he just so happened to be at the wrong place at the right time. BOOM! His life changes one day when he goes to his favorite spot for lunch only to find a pop-star model at his secret spot.  
Okay, cool. These things can happen. Supernatural events ensue. Kind of surprised, but nothing unexpected of an anime.  
The story begins to evolve into a bit of a romance between characters, a little bit of mystery, and the promise for action. At this point in time, I am really enjoying this show. 
What happens after episode -- is disturbing and unworthy of appraisal. I had to force-feed my eyes to continue watching this anime just to knock it off my list. *phew* now it's over.  
After episode -- ( which by the way they did end it with credits as if it were an official season ending ) the story begins to evolve into one big filler. Afterwards, you realize that this is not a filler and actually the real story. The flow of events holds for awhile until nearing the end of the anime, where the entire anime turns bizarre. 
Story line : Dreadful 
Graphics : Decent modern graphics 
Sound : Intense at times. Not bad. 
Characters : Backstory is provided for the main characters in the anime. The backstory may be the best part of the show. 
Character voices : English voices held emotion and followed easily. 
Overall Score: - 
Recommended : Only if you plan on dropping the anime after episode --. Most people tend to like finishing anime. I guess that would mean NO.

One Punch Man!? Straight --'s across the board. Why!? Because it's awesome. I don't know how anyone couldn't like this anime honestly. 
Storyline: A hero that kills everything in one punch, but truly just wishes he could find an enemy who can take more then one punch from him? It's so simply and yet it's so enjoyable. 
Characters: All the characters are precious in their own way. Specially Saitama. 
Art & Sounds: The art... is absolutely insane. I can't even begin to describe how intense the fights are and how crazy the art is. Take - minutes to just watch one fight on youtube and you'll definitely be hooked. The sound is just as great, the publishers of this anime have done such an amazing job on the art and sound for this anime. 
My Final Conclusion: Everyone should see this anime, seriously. Not much else I can say. Go now... watch it and bask in it's glory.

Part of the long running 'Minna no Uta' program on NHK, which are two-minute long animated music videos. Meaning ""Songs for Everyone"", this has been a staple of the network for almost six decades, and usually the all-audiences songs are aimed at the younger viewers. Covering all types of songs and all types of animation styles, generally not very sophisticated artwork or animation, and not long enough to tell a real story. Just a couple minutes to fill in the broadcast until the next show.    
This is just another simple short video, this time about a boy who starts playing on an old piano, and then by the end he is playing in a concert hall.  Artwork and animation is very much like the ""Red Bull Gives You Wings"" commercials.

P: the placeholder is a show that put too many eggs in one basket and wasn’t able to properly handle it. The show has two plot lines with one being a mystery police procedural and the second falling more in the line of urban fantasy and both being interconnected by the antagonistic group. The plot isn’t bad per se as it tries to keep the viewers on its toes with its many plot twists and having insignificant plot points being more than it seems. The problem is that the characters are underwhelming. Everyone just comes of as underdeveloped, even the side characters who really don’t need that much development or depth in the first place. This also affects the way the plot twists are handled because they really don’t have that much weight to them to a show that heavily relies on them. The only character that is in any sort of way compelling is Lily and that’s many due to her personality and not by her depth or complexity. They all just come off as plot devices, placeholders that someone forgot to properly write in. this is also a “netflix original series” and the production value is really good, but not much else. 
I wish i would have written more, but i just don’t care much about this show emotionally to go on further. There’s a sequel to this and i wished i wrote this ahead of time so i would have jokingly called the second season M: the middle and the third E: the ending.

Self portrait is a simple short film.  Its definitely not something you will regret seeing, but it doesn't really leave much of an impact.  The story is simple, a sculptor creates a demon that comes to life and the demon attempts to become the creator by sculpting the creator.  That is really it, no real characterization or story (granted it is a short film).   
On the other hand the stop motion animation looks great.  As someone who tried stop motion animation and knows at least what goes into it, it was great seeing a complex piece of art .  Its also rare to see stop motion animation and actually seeing it is rather cool (even if it is rather old).  The music itself is okay sets the mood I guess. 
Overall, its a decent piece of animation that hopefully you will not regret seeing if you do decide to see it.

Short, simple and sweet never could have been more apt! The story was slow, short, easy to predict yet really heart warming and beautiful. The writer managed to touch all our hearts by writing a story revolving around love that is simply pure and deep! I felt the music at the beginning was off and a bit a weird but later  it really sank in with the anime and was smooth and perfect! The characters were simple, light and a tad bit premature(hotaru, age--, in my opinion) but they were all elegant at the end. I have never seen a movie so short and so touching at the same time! I would suggest this movie to people who love the feeling of love and being loved(just for the feeling), which is pretty much everyone!!!

I am commenting this as a person who expected a Sengoku Basara/Historical Seinen anime out of this and not a romance-themed one. Just so you know. This is also why I decided to write a review, since I don't do that much... I just thought people should have my two cents on this as  someone who is not interested in the anime at all, but will see it in its entirety. 
Pathetic. That was the word I was looking for my review's main theme. I am very thankful to MAL for putting it as the -'s title. If you're looking for a seinen, historical, samurai/ninja anime with a lot of battles - this is not for you. It's pure shoujo (otome games type) in my eyes (I watch the aforementioned genres a lot). 
Following MAL's list of characteristics, I will try to be as informative as possible: 
Story: there is a story line, yes. But it is so fragile and broken that it makes no sense at all. Yes, it is normal for a ---episode anime to lack in this field, but this is absurd. There is a the main story of Izanami and her temple, which gets forgotten near the middle of the series. The second plot-line we follow is one we don't know about until the middle of the series - the Unity of the --, that Sanada Yukimura-sama explains near the end of the show. 
Art: I agree, it has good artwork and the movements of the character sis nicely done. Background are excellent and where the staff wanted us to believe something, we would, if it weren't for the squeaky little shoujo (Izanami) 
Sound: What? It had music? Really? I don't think so or even if it did - I can't even point a single moment I have heard it. That, I think, tells you a lot about how 'well' it is chosen and performed. 
Character development: this is where I am stricken with a high fever. What characters and what development? We watch tons of people who we don't know anything about. I couldn't feel for any of the characters since the very beginning and up until now (I have seen all -- episodes for now and will finish the anime till the end). We don't know anything about side-charatcers such as Date Masamune even. I mean, okay, you're telling a story of the Sengoku and we are supposed to know what it's about... or are we? I began loving historical anime because of the Shinsengumi and Sengoku characters in other anime and I am grateful for them, but this one would've made me sick to the stomach from the period if it was my first.The only character who is developed during the series is Izanami, the priestess/diety, who is the only character I couldn't care less about. 
Enjoyment: An advice for the fans of Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing and more similar anime: This is as shoujo as the Sengoku can Get. We have the priestess wimpy kid who is talking all  about how Saizou is her love, her light and her blah-blah, she is even aided by the plot and other characters (which is probably more agitating than her own reactions). She is always there when the main male character fights and it drives me crazy. Just when I get to see some action (- times with Hattori Hanzo and Saizou)she interrupts it with her crying moe eyes and her squeaks of displeasure ""Saizou, leave me! Run away!"" I don't know how many such characters you've seen, but I am feeling a gutty feeling it is not much since it just doesn't quite suit the genre of the Sengoku... Actually, it can be funny, yes, but it is not regarded as such, it is the main story line and she is a the main character.  
Overall: If you're expecting an anime that would feel like  Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing or another such one, don't see this. It reminds me more of Neo Angelique Abyss,  and Hakuouki (though even Hakuouki is better, but I have another story with it - watched only the first season, so don't mark my words as much).

I honestly didn't even know this anime was even suppose to be a detective anime, all I heard from others was that was a drama/romance anime and had really good visual's, (Like most Kyoto-ani productions do.) So the ""detective"" aspect came as a surprise to me, a good surprise nonetheless as I do love mystery and detective games, however unlike the other detective games and anime I've watched and loved (Such as Danganronpa) it didn't have as nearly as heavy of a tone with it's mysteries.  
Unlike something like Danganronpa that chooses crazy characters and extreme-over-the-top murders to be it's ""selling point."" Hyouka takes a more laid-back set of characters approach and more believable crimes and mysteries they have to solve. Nothing they solve is extremely unbelievable and i'd go as far as saying the first mystery they solve is the craziest they will get. It's something normal high school students might actually solve within their daily lives. It was nice seeing this more laid back tone within a detective/mystery style show as most detective works, (Such as Ace Attorney or Danganronpa) go for a more over-the-top approach. There's nothing wrong with over the top, it's just enjoyable to see some more believable mysteries every once and a while. 
As stated at the beginning of the review, the anime has the ""gorgeous artwork"" Kyoto-ani is known for with a fun cast of memorable characters. While all these characters stand out in their own right I really wanted to highlight the main ""detective"" Hotaro Oreki. Typically I don't find myself loving the main character however I gotta say this is one of my all time favorite protagonists. His ""laid-back energy conservation lifestyle"" is one of the best main character traits I've seen, really embodies most anime viewers personalities. I never once really found myself yelling ""HOW CAN YOU BE SO DENSE"" well watching him like most ""in love"" main characters and I actually quite enjoyed most of the scenes he was in, even when any of the other ""more interesting"" main characters aren't supporting him on screen, he was still interesting to watch and had some good comedic moments. I don't highlight the main character a whole lot in reviews however I did feel some importance in highlighting Oreki, as he's one of my favorite main protagonists of all time. 
A little side note, the music was absolutely one of my favorites parts of the anime. I don't know much about music so i'm not gonna go into it, but when they started working on a mystery and that soundtrack kicked in, god was I hooked. 
All in all I loved this anime, it got boring at certain times and a few of the mysteries were extremely hollow or just dragged out for too long and stuffed with filler but I still managed to enjoyed my timel watching this anime, even if you're not a huge fan of the mystery genre, the characters and animation and even comedy are enough to be worth giving it a watch.

Introduction: 
Gintama... One of the top-rated anime that come out here on this website. At first when I saw Gintama on this website, having -+/-- ratings on almost every show of it, I persuaded myself to watch all of the seasons even if its really hard due to my schedule. ---+ Episodes? Seriously. I can't even finish Bleach which is also ---+ episodes. So I recklessly tried Gintama from the beginning last summer and I, in fact, one of those who rated every Gintama a --/-- with one pure reason. Comedy plus Values. Thats how I summarized Gintama. Now this season, the new Gintama came out and it is the ""Slip Arc"". 
Story: 
As stated in the first episode, this arc will present some comedic material throughout the series and after it, will begin the final arc which is the ""Silver Soul"" arc. Now I don't have a problems with this thing because more Gintama meaning more laughter that I really need in my life. If I'm going to review the story of Gintama, then you already know it is hard because... Gintama is meant to be random, though it is full of arcs and side stories. On this season of Gintama, we are presented by ""Slip Arc"", that also have side stories. For example, the story of Nishi Ikumatsu (Katsura's crush who makes ramen for him), who we saw how she was longing to see that one person who was keep on coming to her shack.  Then comes Gin and Kankou (Umibouzou) father issues with the Titans. And also the scabbards' romantic story. Those were funny but there is still some value hidden within it. Like the story of Terakado Tsu (Otsu-chan), who was fallen to the streets again but rose up due to the help of her fans (this was a very funny two episodes). Slip Arc presented us variety of laughable side stories with simple values. Though -- episodes is really not enough. Lack of executions or content is one of the issue of this arc though it is also an advantage to the author to go ahead with the final arc. What I can describe to it accurately is that this Gintama is like the mini-version of the first season of Gintama. Bite-sized. Let me tell you this. Compare a bite-size Oreo (the mini ones) to the original Oreo cookie. What Oreo have the more milk and chocolate? What Oreo have more taste? Obviously, its the original one although, the bite-size one are made for the ones who are lazy? or who wants to eat it like chips. The ""Porori-hen"" (Slip Arc) offered us what the original Gintama can do although the original have more variety. 
Characters: 
Ahh yes.. They are back at it again... First minute of the first episode of this anime showed us already that Gintama is basically the king of all parodies. With the references on top even on the following episodes, its safe to say that all of the characters stick to their attitude and motives since when they appeared in the other seasons. Also, we get to learn more stories about other characters and what can they do like Musashi, Tetsuko (the blacksmith) and Ikumatsu. 
Art: 
Art is simply Gintama and nothing changed. Though I love how the opening gave us so much colors and when it goes to the chorus, it shows the characters running and the background is full of past scenes from past episodes, which gives a good signifance to it. 
Sound: 
The opening gives us hype and thats all we need for every Gintama episode. While the ending gives us like good sets of girls dressed up in bride dress. Not to mention, the soundtrack and other sounds (like when Katsura enters and when someone fails) gives us a Gintama element to it. 
Overall thoughts and Enjoyment: 
This Gintama is one of the highest rated anime that was currently aired and yes it deserves to be one of the highest. Enjoyment was top-notch and it is safe to say that this Gintama is like a taste-test (or bite size lol) to the original Gintama. I, honestly, recommend you to watch it before the final arc of Gintama comes so that we will be having smiles before we end Gintama (even though I dont want it to end).

Forget about the basket anime or the volleyball anime, try AMERICAN FOOTBALL anime because you know, why not? Out of all sports that you watch, it has to be american football. Some of you right now probably lives in America and kinda knows nothing about american football.  
Eyeshield -- is an under rated sports anime because it is a pretty old sport anime and it is american football. Not that many people even knows about this sport unless you live in america, but Eyeshield -- did this sport an amazing job on making it interesting and enjoyable. 
Story: (-/--) 
The protagonist, Sena, isn't your usual hot headed guy but a weakling, who grows as a person quietly but also strongly and together with his newly and weak formed team, they work hard to win the Christmas Bowl, a championship game for American Football. All under the alias, Eyeshield -- 
Eyeshield -- did a very good job with pacing for every game is never feels like it ended to abruptly and allows us to know our opponents, showing us that they are just like our main team, all working hard to win the championship and should not be dismissed for their losses are real and painful to them.  
Eyeshield -- doesn't just use the fact that their opponents are stronger than them, but use the factor of how small the team is with no reserve, stamina, and time. They use time so well because you, the watchers are aware of how little the time is and it makes your hearts beat fast as you try to think of what can happen next because with so little time this is probably the end for our main team. It uses all these factors very well on making you be on the edge of your seat. 
Eyeshield -- started strong and goes on strong but ended with an abrupt ending though, but the kind that you can allow to pass because of how good all of the story are with it's suspenseful matches with heartfelt characters, opponents included, and witty and comedic moments.  
Art (-) and Sound (-): 
The sounds is nothing spectacular, with pretty catchy opening song and one soundtrack that stands out more than other, it is nothing of praise but not to be hate either. But the voice acting are just perfect. 
The art though, Eyeshield -- is a manga drawn by Yusuke Murata, who I considered a God of art. Though at first in his manga, the art is drawn averagely, Yusuke Murata grow as an artist and his art flourished like flowers in spring time. Eyeshield -- anime did a poor job to capture that beauty of an art but still enjoyable to watch, and the animation can be something to be cried over. Compared to the sports anime of today's time (like kuroko no basket or haikyuu) it is poor with overused scenes. I recommend on watching this first before reading the manga, because if this is the first thing you watch, the art and animation can still enjoyable before reading the manga and realizing what an awful job they did with the animation and art. 
Characters (-/--): 
Sena is through and through a scaredy cat but Sena's moments being one gets  shorter and shorter because he grows up. He still gets scared yes, but his need of thrill and curiosity of fighting against someone stronger get a hold of him and he rises up, with a straight back and kind heart. His new and empty phone slowly gets filled up for with every matches, the opponents don't stay as opponents but also a friend and a companion in American Football and his team mates stays with him though thick and thin. That's what makes him a fleshed out protaganist, still being him and not changing but growing with a kind personality but is not a pushover. 
The most memorable character is Hiruma, the team's captain, but each of the characters, both in team and the opponents, aren't just a theme but a character, some more well rounded than others, that knows the feeling such as being in the bottom and not being able to be the best they are or something else that is also complex and heartfelt. They are relatable with good character designs, they aren't the characters that you will easily forget. 
Overall (-/--): 
If it weren't for the so-so music, the could-be-better animation and its abrupt ending, people would fawn over it much more, I think. But this anime is a must watch for it's good pacing, well rounded characters and humors. Also, it's american football, the sport itself is pretty interesting.

If you want and anime with great characters, exiting plot twists and a amazing story i suggest you avoid this at all cost. 
bleach began as a very enjoyable anime... then lost it all. 
after about episode -- is fails to show anything new.(this includes everything ive seen to around ep ---). the battles become dull and uninspired and the characters stay the same(just like Naruto).

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the perfect example on how a shounen series must be. 
First I have to say that I'm an avid animanga goer. I have seen quite some series with different genres, and I also have other favorite titles. But among all of those favorite titles of mine, FMA:B stands gallantly, as it was the only one with such intelligence and perfection I was completely at loss for words when finishing it. 
Story - The best part that shines the brightest in the series as whole. FMA:B, just like the manga, focuses on the Elric brothers as they embark upon a journey to get their original bodies back. Everything -- and by everything I mean from their backstories, the little arc, the wonderful climax and the satisfying conclusion -- is very well-thought, well-done. Everything about the alchemy thing and the (minor spoilers maybe) Homunculus thing, they completely blew my mind. The story was so brilliant and even though it started off with so many questions and so many confusions, the expanding story and the resolution answered them all for us. This story is what I would call, smart. It is complex, but not insane. The way we gradually understand the things happening inside the FMA:B universe is thanks to this anime's gratifying explanations. We are not too dumb to understand the story, and we aren't that smart to guess where the story is going either. All the ideas are very wonderful and magnificent. You don't usually find something this clever in an anime series... 
As an additional note, I really loved the ending. It was totally -- out of --. No spoilers from me, though. 
Art - The art is cool as well. They are the usual Hiromu Arakawa style, not too detailed but pleasant to the eyes. I especially liked the alchemy effects and the symbols, they are super cool. 
Sound - WELL WELL. I have the entire opening & ending songs. From again until Rain. From Uso until Ray of Shine. I have the entire anime soundtracks, composed by the brilliant Senju Akira, the three discs of magnificence. I listen to them over and over again. I have to tell you the sound is very diverse and beautiful. The voice actors and actresses are also brilliant. Romi Paku, oh gosh, you guys know how well she voices people. Ed is no exception. The sound effects, voice acting, BGMs, and opening-ending themes are all beautiful, what else to say man? 
Character - There are a lot of characters here. From our main characters to the enemies. The 'gray' characters as it was initially unclear where they belonged with. Suspicions and betrayals, enemies who turn allies. These characters are blessed with distinguishable characteristics and each one of them are unique. Even the characters who only appeared for little time can be very memorable to you (I'm talking about a certain character). There aren't any useless characters. 
Enjoyment - I TOTALLY enjoyed this show. It was astounding. Breathtakingly awesome. This is not the series you could marathon in a day as you will go insane... though I doubt you can wait for the next episode til the next day. The series is very smart, and though there are some tragedies, it's still sweet, beautiful, and heartwarming. The ending doe. 
Overall, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as I had stated before and I will have to state it again now, is a perfect example on how a shounen series must be. Looking for a series with depth and complexity? The perfect series for you. Looking for some laughs? This series also have it, but don't blame me if you get caught up in this marvelous series, even though you didn't mean to. 
You will get caught up anyway.

Having finally finished ""Clockwork Planet"" I can finally reach a conclusion. Overall this does have a nice number of things going for it. Some good background music, an interesting world, and some great character back and forths.... 
However execution is key and at numerous times throughout the series events feel so rushed and characters seem to be arbitrarily stupified.  
The main problem.over everything else is certainly in the character designs. Everyone looks - or - yo. Which really intensifies the awkwardness of some of the scenes dialogue or visuals. I can honestly imagine Sora from No Game No Life saying certain lines from the shows main character and them working. But on account of a child saying them they just seem shoved in his mouth rather than part of his character.  
If these characters had been aged properly I can guarantee that everything else remaining equal this show would be succeeded among a larger audience. As it stands presently... idk go listen to the ost on YouTube. 
I can't give it a recommendation for anyone considering it. This is average for the most part and it's character designs only emphasize that. All in all I give it a -/--

I'll start by saying that after watching - episodes I was compelled to write my first review for an anime on this site.  
It's true certain aspects of a show can appeal more favourably to people depending on what they value. In saying that, I will focus on what this show does so well for me and why I consider it one of the best I've seen. 
Story:  
The introduction of Violet can understandably come across as odd due to the monotone way in which she addresses other characters. This may be off putting to viewers as I've noticed in some other reviews, but this set up is to a soon to be deeper story is just that: a set up. From what seems to be an ordinary show with a simple premise, rises one with humanity and heartfelt emotion. The character Violet is the canvas and each one of her encounters adds another layer of life to her story. I respect the writers for having the capacity to create these memorable moments through subtle recalling of other plot points that makes the show feel tied together. On top of that the dialogue has this poetic nature to it, whereby it doesn't attempt to add unnecessary complexity but simply lays bare the message it wishes to communicate. 
Sound: 
There is so much I would like to say about the music of this show but I will keep it to a minimum. What music should do well in any show is add to the emotion the story is trying to communicate. VE does this exceedingly well, providing a different variety of sounds depending on the situation. There are those intimate moments where it's often accompanied by one or two instruments, and there are more intense moments accompanied by orchestra. Overall there's a large variety of well written melodious music, and it has to go down as one of the best anime soundtracks I have heard to date. 
Art: 
You only have to watch the first episode to understand the quality of the visuals, and I would have to put this anime in my number one spot for that department because it is truly beautiful. It's only after watching VE have I realised the full extent in which visuals and sound can make the watching experience better. The colours are vibrant and there is a consistency of detail in every scene which keeps your eyes fixated on the screen in awe. Detailed facial expressions make the heartfelt moments of the show much more impactful. There is also this tendency to cut to exquisite detailed sceneries whether it be the backdrop of a starry sky or a field of flowers. But it doesn't stop there because these moments are scattered across every scene, with the environment, objects and camera perspectives adding unbridled levels of detail. If I didn't like the story, I would still be looking forward to seeing VE because of how aesthetically pleasing it is for the viewer. I applaud the artists of this show for the work they have done, as you can see the amount of love and effort they have put into it. This show is an artistic masterpiece in it's own right and I have no problem making that claim to anyone. 
Character: 
I can't say too much without giving away plot points but the focus of the show is almost entirely on Violet, with additional characterisation given to those that appear from episode to episode. I have invested in this journey Violet is on, as I can see how her character grows each week as she experiences more of a beautiful world she has never seen. I believe that everyone who watches the show will relate to Violet in some way as we have all seen the world through the lens of beauty or wonder at some point, and we are all on a similar path of discovery. Episode - is a particularly memorable episode and is a contained story featuring just Violet and two other characters. Minimal characters and concise well-written stories allow this show to shine and provide something that many anime's take several episodes to build up towards. It is a bold attempt at providing viewers a sense of fulfilment in just over -- minutes, and I can say that it has given me that almost every week. When I began VE I thought of it as something that was 'pretty' and had potential, but now I look forward every week to see where it will go next. 
Overall: 
The scores I am giving are based on what I have seen to date. If I was to review the first - or - episodes, certain scores would have been lower. Story for example, picks up significantly from about episode - and is now consistently outstanding in my opinion.

I know you will think that it is kind of generous when to give --/-- but this anime deserves it. Nobody is perfect but this is so far the nearest to be a perfect anime.  
Story. It strikes me with an interesting plot where - different persons switch places and do their daily life as another person. 
Art. The art is was VERY BEAUTIFUL very very beautiful. It is like a painting that can bring happiness same as heartwarming feeling to our hearts. The art express how humans really should be grateful about their surroundings because everyone has their own perspective. 
Sounds. The background music always fit with the current scenes. It also uplift emotions. it strikes me with ""You can be happy, but look around you and you should be grateful!"" which always makes me emotional.  
The only bad thing by watching it for the first time. 
The story about how they are changing places and how they act as another person is kinda rush and also after the -/- of the story I felt a distance between the character's friends and the main characters. I never felt so lonely before. 
Conclusion: There's always somebody out there see the world like yourself. That's thought this movie give me. A masterpiece on its own and very friendly movie with a mixed feelings. Very entertaining movie. 
PS: I've been waiting for this kind of movie about switching bodies because I really like to compare what others think of another person based on their actions. What if I was him what will he think about her? what if I was her what would I think about him? something like that.. The way of thinking of Makoto Shinkai is a masterpiece and he just explained it but making this movie. For the whole -- years of my life this movie was the one I was waiting for. --/-- should watch this movie..

This is a masterpiece. Every single bit of it. Easily my favorite anime of all time and the first one I recommend to people. They are always hooked when I explain the beginning of the plot, which I feel like isn't explained well enough in the summary page (but for good reason, as it does give away the first few episodes). You really need to make it in about six episodes to fully understand what's going on and get hooked.  
The characters are so beautifully drawn and complex. There are no two characters that look alike. You can gleam a lot about a character's personality just by their face, eyes, stance, and expression. How many other animes can you say that about? Very careful and precise care was taken designing these characters. You can even tell what beautiful characters have ugly or cold souls just by looking at the way their eyes are drawn. The attention to detail is the best I've ever seen in any anime. None of that ""every character looks the same except for the hair."" 
The plot is complex and compelling. The mystery gets darker and more complex the further it goes. The protagonist gets more and more jaded as the story goes on. His appearance changes subtly. The clothes he wears, his facial hair, his eyes, his hair, everything. He starts out so innocent and nice and he slowly changes to the point where if you put the picture of before and after next to each other, they look like different people. It is subtle, but incredible that the creator managed to do that. 
If you're a fan of dark, serious animes, this is for you. It uses no cheap tricks to terrify you. Gore is pretty minimal. It's mostly psychological and I think that is so much scarier.

The Isekai genre has a problem. 
It's a problem that has been going on ever since ---- with the release of Konosuba and Re:Zero. It is also a problem that more often or not ruins the industry image from outsiders as many people from other mediums would say that the anime medium is vapid shit that has no substance base on the self insert/waifu pandering that were shown by various Isekai anime. 
Wise Man's Grandchild is the embodiment of this as it's not only a horrendously made anime that is void of passion and creativity it also shamelessly represents everything that is wrong with this genre. 
The plot centres around a self insert Gary Sue named Shin Walford who is reincarnated as a baby in a fantasy world after getting ran over and killed by truck kun in his previous life. He is soon adopted by an old wander named Merlin Walford and soaked up Merlin's teachings, earning him some shocking powers and abilities; however when he turned -- Merlin realised that he forgot to teach him quote ""Common sense and social skills'. Unquote. I wish I joking. 
Anyway with the help of Merlin's friend Shin enrols into Shin into a prestigious magic academy where he can not only socialise with people but to also hone his skills and abilities. Thus he's adventures begin. 
If I had to describe the story in one world is lazy. You know when you have that one -- year old in class that constantly shares their bad anime fanfics to you. 
That's what this show is. It's a collection of generic anime cliches and fantasy isekai story elements that don't mesh well together thanks to the shows vomit including writing which I will get to in a bit. 
There are no stakes whatsoever as the protagonist would overpowered the villains at any time. The setting is a generic boring setting before. There's no world-building to speak as the show rather spends it's time on sick self insert pandering. 
It wouldn't be so bad if the writing was so trash. You cannot watch a single episode of Wise Man's Grandchild without face slamming your head on a iron table. 
This is only enhanced by the ---year-old tier fan fiction dialogue which was downright painful to watch on screen. 
The worst thing about Wise Man Grandchild is how lazy it is. I know I just described the story as lazy but this is only the thick of it as it not only rips off plots from other isekai/fantasy anime it also reuses locations with little to no changes. 
My favourite being Kazuma's Mansion as despite being slighting brighter as well-having adding and removing a couple of outdoor mansion decoration the mansion is the bloody same. I understand that drawing hundreds of backgrounds for an anime is hard, especially on a tight deadline and budget but nobody has been stupid enough to recuse background scenery from other isekai animes as plan B. It's like I'm watching a anime equivalent of a asset flip of steam. 
The asset flip and poorly written story is made worse with the soulless characters are a void of personality. 
Shin is a boring Gary Sue who is overpowered and has no flaws. 
He has a personality of a brick and he has no motivations other to project his friends and city because plot reasons. 
The supporting characters are just a collection of bland anime stereotypes that you have all seen before. 
You have the shy blue hair girl with big boobs, the tsundere red hard girl, the yellow hair kindhearted best friend boy and couple of old farts. How lazy and uninspired can you get. 
Finally we have villains and to be honest the less I speak about them the better because you can tell what type of villains they are going to be based on the amateur hour poster that was done in Photoshop. 
The presentation is a mixed bag. While the animation is subpar and fight choreography at times is laughable the character designs, background scenery and lightning were pretty solid minus the stock images. 
The soundtrack had as much passion as the plot and characters. It uses various generic fantasy tracks that don't keep the viewer interested due to how bland they are. 
This is only made worse by poor direction as various times it doesn't know how to properly place it's own tracks to create tension to the fights and narrative. 
Both the opening and ending themes are generic pop songs with meaningless lyrics. 
The voice acting for both languages is alright but nothing too special. 
Wise Man's Grandchild.exe has stopped working. 
Wise Man's Grandchild is what happens when you have no creativity and passion. It is an infuriating garbage fire that relays on cliches and tropes just to please the lowest common denominator of anime fans with it's cringely dialogue and fan fiction writing. 
Wise Man's Grandchild may decent production values and voice acting but it ultimately don't matter if your plot and characters were at the bottom of the barrel. 
The only thing that you should do as Wise Man's Grandchild is concerned is to stay as far away from it as possible as this is just another Isekai anime that has no soul and passion.  
Avoid the series like the plague and watch That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or Konosuba instead.

ONE OF THE WORST ANIME I'VE WATCHED. 
I'm being serious here. Basically it's about the journey of our mc and the heroine to collect -- swords (- episode=- sword). So what makes it terrible in my opinion? First off let's start with the action, even though it's an action anime it's actually --% dialogue -% action, are you hoping for an epic fight? then you shouldn't watch this anime because it doesn't exist here, the enemies got defeated very easily (sometimes it doesn't even shown on screen, yes it's that ridiculous). 
But I might still be able to accept that (since I really liked Zetsuen no Tempest which in some episodes is even ---% dialogue). What makes it the worse is that I can't even connect to the story, I found it hard to have any emotional attachment to it since the mc is abstain from having human emotions (even though he developed later on I still can't relate to him). It also failed to make me interested enough to the side characters (the maniwani is so BS they served almost no purpose to the story) and I doesn't even care what happens to them. 
Romance? Can't feel it either. The relationship between the characters feel so weak and unnatural. The only good thing about this anime is the interesting designs of the characters. 
Now let's move on to the worst part, it's the ending which is SO FREAKING TERRIBLE, I won't give spoilers but you would feel like what you felt after finishing episode -, ""it ends just like that?"", ""what's even the purpose of the story"" ,""I wasted my time"" is what I thought after finishing the last episode. Still can't understand how this anime got such high ratings on MAL, their high rating is what kept me going on (since I thought something good would happen later on) even though I'm on the verge of dropping it . This is the first time I give a rating much lower than on MAL (usually it's pretty close) and I'm soo disappointed (feels like the good reviews were just trolls).

I'll be blunt in saying this anime was such a major disappointment. 
Story: -/-- 
-Episode - started very well. I actually really liked episode -, and the whole world-building aspect is done very well by Jun Maeda. However, the quality of the show is super inconsistent. It starts off well, and then just falls apart at episode -. It slightly picks itself up at episode -,but then the series just tapers off to being absolutely terrible. 
-Romance feels extremely forced, and there are many times in the storyline where the decisions made by the characters are just not common sense or realistic in any way. 
-Key is known for the ""feels"". Nothing here. 
Art: -/-- 
-Great job here. No complaints. Characters move very well and look good. 
Sound: -/-- 
-Meh. Key has produced better stuff. I would like to direct your attention to Rewrite's OST. Compared to all other anime, the sound is still just meh. 
-The opening is alright, but nowhere close to other stuff by Key again. Ending is alright in the same respects. 
Character: -/-- 
-The problem with this anime is that none of the characters seem to show any character development, and there are too many characters to full feel a connection to any of them. Yu is incredibly inconsistent in his behaviour, and Nao, although would be my favourite key main heroine on paper, does not have sufficient backstory, development, or meaningful screentime. Really, the anime should not have just stuck with the five characters it began with. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
-I guess if you wanted to see an easy plot and good art that it would be slightly enjoyable. But no, this was just plain boring. 
Overall: -/-- 
-Very hard to watch. Would not recommend. If you want Jun Maeda, turn to Kanon, Air, or Clannad, which at least are successful in tearing you up. This just makes you go wtf.

While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, bizarre as it may sound, of Christopher Nolan and his style of movie-making. You know, complex stories with multiple twists that try to intrigue you up until the end credits (and sometimes beyond). For the most part, they succeed, yet my problem  with his movies is a consistent lack of believable, living characters, all I see are puppets who are there for the sole purpose of letting the puppeteer tell his story. 
Well, Wolf Children is a complete opposite of Nolan's style. The story is very basic with but one unusual twist to it which is revealed even in the title. This anime, however, features a whole cast of characters who are practically leaping out of the screen. Some may consider it a flaw; personally, I don't require a sophisticated story to make the experience enjoyable for me. And, you know, since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies are considered classics despite having the most basic plots imaginable, I believe it's true for a lot of people.  
This anime is a perfect proof that sometimes you don't need to make up a story, you don't really need to force conflicts. There are even no antagonists here. What I consider this title to be is a genuine representation of life. And it is really all you need: life has conflicts, life is difficult as it is. You don't really need to invent anything else, you just have to make it feel real. 
This movie manages to do just that, in no small part thanks to its pacing. It has a very unique feeling to it, despite covering a big period of time, it still manages to take its time. There are a lot of still and slow scenes, sometimes silent or practically silent to allow the atmosphere really sink in. I tend to admire movies that successfully utilize this storytelling tool since it really shows the advantages of visual media. Yes, i am a confident proponent of the ""show, don't tell"" idea. 
Speaking of ""show"", the art was kind of a mixed bag for me. The movie looks a bit like a sketch, yet it stays consistent with its style. In the end, it doesn't come out as lazy artwork but instead as a choice to make the atmosphere soft. It took a bit for me to get used to it but it was never able to take me out of the experience. I guess that's just my personal attraction to detailed and perfect art instead of the hand-made feeling the creators are going for here. 
The music is often absent, it only comes in at truly dramatic moments to make sure they leave a desired impression. It's not used to reflect the characters' feelings, this title uses it only to supplement its narrative, not to replace it. For what it's worth, it's adequate. The voice acting was, again, adequate. Just your standard set of good actors doing a good job. 
Talking about characters themselves would mean spoiling the show, since its narrative mostly has to do with exploring their personality, so I'm not going to do this. I'm just going to say that they all feel like real alive people, and are very relatable; especially the mother, she is just all around a wonder of a human being.  
Overall, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, mostly because of its tone being not for everyone and the artistic choice but it's definitely great and one of my favorite anime movies from now on.

KonoSuba or *insert full name here* is one of the few light novel adaptations that doesn't immediately make me lose interest. The first impressions was good and made me go ""Hey, I want more of this kind of comedy."" That was pure gold. 
Judging by its looks, KonoSuba is one of THOSE fantasy, trapped in a game/world/whatever action anime, which is one of the growing trends these days. However, KonoSuba isn't an show where people are to take it seriously. That itself was evident, after watching its first episode. Following the protagonist, Kazuma who is resurrected and sent to the fantasy world, he's given one task: to defeat the so-called ""Devil King"". But there's just barely any progression in its plot. All of the episodes just have him and his party completing quests; majority are trivial and a few ""compulsary"" ones. 
So, where's all the fun? 
KonoSuba's saving grace is its comedy. Unfortunately, its strength is also its own Achilles' heel. Why? it delivers only about HALF of the time. Let's start off by mentioning a few okay ones: Kazuma's stealing ability. Megumin's single use per day spell. Darkness's masochistic personality. All these are funny, yes, but it quickly gets dull when recycled over and over. Even the best jokes only made me crack a smile. Alas, when the humor fails, well, I just cringe. Living cabbages that attack people!!...HAHAHA...nope. Just stop. 
The characters are merely just comedic versions of existing stereotypes, so they aren't special. First off, there's Kazuma. Despite being a shut-in and Otaku he's the most rational, in comparison to his other three members who conveniently, are all females. At least, he isn't a complete beta male. Nonetheless, he's still generic. 
The other three members are: Megumin the mage, ""Darkness"" the crusader, and lastly Aqua, a Goddess whose attitude is identical to that of a spoiled child. Her role in the show is be a constant irritation. Obviously, her whining is supposedly meant for entertainment purposes, for me its nothing but infuriating. Megumin is like-able, but my interests for her just disappeared about halfway in the series. Supporting characters such as Wiz(a gorgeous big-breasted waifu) and Chris had some potential but having only meager amount of screen time, I didn't particularly care that much about them. Wiz is definitely hot, don't get me wrong. But like I said, she needed more screen time for me to actually start caring for her. All in all, most of the characters were simply boring. 
KonoSuba's animation by current standards, barely holds up. The backgrounds are great, but animation of characters are so-so. Not the best, not the worst either. 
Not much to criticise about the sound aspect; decent voiceacting, okay soundtracks/OP/ED. Although, Aqua's voice would make my ears bleed. 
Ultimately, both of KonoSuba's major strengths and weaknesses lie within its own comedy and humor. There's also lack of story progression, so it just ends up as a slice of life/comedy anime. KonoSuba is passable, at best. Not sure if I should recommend this or not, but perhaps to fans of comedy anime with slice of life elements. Despite that, I cannot guarantee they will have an enjoyable experience. Some people can fully appreciate this anime, while others will loathe it.

At first i didn't want to write it, but...i just had to. Cant stay silent when someone butchers a legendary series with a cheap cash-grab. 
Not sure where to start so..i'll start with positives, as its whole -/-- so got to have some, right? Ok. Positives: opening. End of positives. 
Really. It looks ok, music isnt terrible... 
Problems begin when the opening ends and show starts. Its one of the ugliest series i've seen in YEARS. It looks worse than DB, DBZ ang GT. Can't stop wondering why - dragon ball shits golden eggs for years, so i expected level of FSN: UBW, Naruto Shippuden, One Punch Man and other fighting series we see nowadays. Actually, i'd be happy even with the quality presented in the opening.  But this is straight bad. Characters, backgrounds, effects... everything looks cheap and amateur. Cut-scenes in DB games look better.  
Let's continue. Story. It's on a whole different level of bullshit than GT. First of all, its inconsistent with regular DBZ. Examples? Beerus popping out of nowhere, then its further explained that if kaioshins die, he vanishes too. Where was he when Buu was butchering kaioshins? Or in latest events of buu saga when last - kaioshins could be annihilated any second? OK, lets say he could pop in a second and -shot buu...i wont even start with golden freeza, and those random characters with random abilities in tournament, the most unfitting characters in DB World. The future trunks saga is when it totally breaks any logic that was introduced in DBZ. Trunks going back in time created alternative future, events splitted. In - continuum goku lives, in other he's dead for good. Then how the heck this joke-of-a-kaioshin from trunks continuum got to know goku and create black in his image, if goku died of disease before anyone knew about beerus and other universes, so if he was dead i guess he couldnt visit the other universe. But fck logic, right? And more problems popup with every episode. 
I dont really know japanese, so cant talk about dubbing. Characters sound ok, i like beerus voiceactor.  
I kept watching hoping for improvement, end with each episode it was only getting worse and worse and worse and worse....i finally gave up and wont be trying it again. Better to rewatch DBZ remaster next time...

after watching it through the end all that leave is:  
well at least the animation art are great. 
for you who actually a digimon fans will found it a total rip-off of war game movies, then i can't help the digimon version seems more like.. better.. 
perhaps it's because 'it's the work of the same staff' thing then why would they made are freakin similar theme just to make it more fancy with unrealistic wierd family drama.. i just.. dissapointed.  
but for you that haven't watch the digimon version might think it's pretty much interesting theme 
i can't find the protagonist stand out that great except he's just being a math smartass and all. the heroine is just plain to the point that for the first half movie i just see her as a horrible girl 
the seiyuus sound unnatural or perhaps the drama itself is unnatural in the first place that makes the seiyuus sounds bad(?) i'm not sure.. 
in the end i totally can't help to be biased by digimon because every plot just too similar in different character and visual.. 
well but if you bored and have some free time, it's pretty much alright

A-- Pictures has been a hit and miss anime productions studio. They have given us gems like Your Lie in April, The Flower We Saw That Day, Space Brothers, Gate Thus the JSDF Fought There!, Ao No Exorcist and arguably SAO. But they have also given us duds like  Denpa Kyoushi, SAO II, Occult Academy, Fractale, Uta no Prince Sama and sadly Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. While the list of A-- anime is varied, the one thing that you can generally expect from an A-- Pictures anime is good towards excellent art and animation. However every season the question you always have to ask is if the premise, plot and characters live up to that same standard.  
Story 
Let me first start of by addressing a certain problem I hope does not become a trend in anime. Before going into this anime it is important to note that there is a second season due out in April ----. In this same season we got the second season of the harem series Shinmai Maou no Testament. The first season ended at this boss fight and the main crux of the story was never resolved. I haven’t watched the second season but I’ll assume it gets closer to having a real ending. In the past there have been harem anime with sequels. I’m thinking of Highschool DxD, Zero no Tsukaima, Rosario no Vampire, Heaven’s Lost Property, The World God Only Knows, Sekirei, Date A Live. Say what you will about these anime but the one thing I personally can say about them is that I feel as though they can stand on their own without needing a sequel.  
Unfortunately Asterisk feels like a - legged chair, incomplete and uncomfortably so. From the premise I was under the impression that this would be a tournament style anime. There is a tournament called The Phoenix Festa but that only begins on episode - out of --. Therefore I assume season - will be all about this tournament and mostly all of season - was really just set up for it. There are - girls in the harem so really the first - episodes was just about getting to know the girls as well as learning more about the protagonist. There were also the standard harem cliches which felt like a checklist of things that had to be in there. I do wonder if it would have been smarter for the tournament to begin earlier and we could have somehow learned more about the girls as the tournament went on. I get that the purpose was so that we would feel more for the characters when the tournament began, but to be honest the matches in season - are only the preliminary rounds so I felt no sense of danger for any of the characters. In comparison to Maou no Testament the last episode didn’t even feel like a boss battle, it felt like a normal episode. So what we are left with is a action anime season where the audience feels nothing because there is no sense of stakes and there has so far been no real sense of danger to the characters. It really does feel as though season - should have been part of season -. I really hope harem anime splitting into - seasons and having the -nd season released - months later doesn’t become a trend. If Shakespeare can write plays without a needed intermission I’m sure a tournament style harem doesn’t need one either.  
Characters 
You got the main tsundere girl who's a princess, the shy/timid girl, the flat chested stoic girl and the voluptuous older blonde president. So yes everyone is a trope and to be honest I wasn’t interested in anyone except the blond president Claudia who is obviously not the main girl. To me good characters have to be more than one note, they can’t be - dimensional characters (pun intended). Yes every girl has this spontaneous and unexplained love for the protagonist but with Claudia there were these moments where you can just tell that there is more than meets the eye. That this girl is suffering and her cheerfulness is just a facade to hide the darkness inside her. Perhaps her interest in the protagonist is more out of a need to have someone to confide in. The problem is that season - didn’t really explain any of it but just gave hints about it. I might watch season - just to learn more about her. The female main love interest seems honorable and noble (again pun intended because she’s princess), but in no way is she interesting but simply transparent. In many ways she is Claudia’s foil, where the main girl is usually on screen while Claudia rarely is. Finally about the male protagonist, I get that some people find him annoying and say he’s the typical harem lead. However i would say that a typical harem lead is oblivious, that is something I wouldn’t say of this protagonist. You can tell by the subtle ways the protagonist interacts with the girls that he thinks of some as love interests but others as friends or the little sister type. Also he isn’t dumb either, in battle he is shown to be quite strategic and level headed. He isn’t overpowered due to a concept known as a “limiter” (which hasn’t been fully explained) where his power is restricted. Therefore I would say he is a decent towards good harem protagonist. The only issue I have so far is that as with many other harem protagonists, he as person is not very interesting and always does the right thing. In many ways both the male and female leads of the show are similar in a most uninteresting way.  
Art/Animation/Sound 
This is probably the one reason to watch the show. Just watch the opening and listen to the ending of the show to get an idea on the art, sound and animation. Everything is just so bright and vibrant, crisp and clean. The score of this anime is very fitting for whatever scene it is in. It uses subtle sound effects in certain places to enhances certain sensations which affects how you feel and interpret a scene. You have minor arpeggio scales on the piano for mystery or suspense, upbeat synth tracks that fit the setting of this high tech world, a snazzy jazz track for some humour. In fact it is rare to have empty spaces where there is no background music in a scene. I feel like it’s important to talk about the battles in this anime. They are by no means the best I’ve ever seen in terms of strategy but they sure are impressive to look at. In a battle there is not just one battle theme, the anime uses different tracks depending on the situation in battle. In battle there were some tracks that sounded like they were from final fantasy, but my favorites were the ones that used synths and techno beats. In terms of visuals, the action flows effortlessly with no drops in frame rate. I was particularly impressed by the use of lighting which made certain sequences seem to glow in surrounding darkness affecting the tone of battle. With the change in lighting they even made sure to effectively include shadow in battle. A scene that comes to mind was when a character is about to meet their end and you see their shadow against the ground representing their doom. There is so much detail, you see sparks, light particles change in air dynamics. I find it amazing that they were able to put so much detail in battle without sacrificing the overall look of the rest of the show. Lastly I want to talk about the weapons in the show. By the end of the series you realize that the weapons themselves are characters in their own right. The weapons are representative of it’s wielder. There is particular care and thought placed into the weapons from their design, colour, sound effects, even the angle at which they are drawn in. Early on I found the scene when the protagonist first obtains his weapon to be downright scary. The vibrating sounds the weapon made were menacing and dangerous like hearing an electric saw inches away from your head. You begin the realize that the weapons themselves seem to harbour certain feelings, they can be joyous or noble, but others can be malice or evil. I commend the anime for using the art and animation to enhance the story. 
Final Thoughts 
Story: -/-- 
Characters: -/-- 
Art/Animation: -/-- 
Sound: -/-- 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Overall -/-- (Note I deducted a -.- due to the lacklustre ending) 
Four episodes into the anime I gave it a -.-/--. In my impressions I wrote  
“In recent years similar shows to this series are decent and fine at best but this series could actually be good. I wonder if this concept has been rehashed to such a degree that the imperfections have diminished. Analogous to a chemist purifying or concentrating a certain solution. Perhaps so, perhaps not.”  
Looking back I’m not sure why I was so optimistic, perhaps I was blinded by the gorgeous visuals and didn’t put enough weight onto the characters. I was enamored by the setting and wanted to learn more about the high tech society. However by the ending of this season I have not really learned anything new about the world itself. Infact I have more questions now then I did at the start. That is the frustrating thing about this anime, there was opportunity to be better than it is. However the story is told in such an uninteresting way with mostly bland characters. I continuously have to ask and remind myself what the stakes of this anime were. Sure characters have their own motives for winning the tournament, purpose, money, reputation, discovery. The problem is that many of these motives/stakes are glossed over and we are never reminded of the stakes until the very end. The anime fails to follow up on the motives and fails to explain why these motives exist which limits the world building of the show. This makes the anime less engaging. The lack of interesting characters hurts the harem aspect of the show and the lack of emphasis on the stakes hurts the storytelling. So what you are left with is mindless action. However the tournament doesn’t begin until episode -. So for - episodes you have an anime that doesn’t really excel at anything save for the few action sequences and some moe/kawaii scenes if that’s what interests you. This is what I call popcorn anime, anime that is pretty to look at but serves little to no other function. If you are a fan of harems you may be able to get over the tropes and may even fall in love with some of the girls. Personally I’m one of these fans, I come home from school and just want to mindlessly watch something that’s cute, sometimes funny, and pretty to look at while I eat dinner. But for non harem fans, it is a waste of time, equivalent to staring at dynamic/animated wallpaper for a few hours. But hey, at least it’s not static wallpaper.

The show itself is pretty hard to follow. It's got text out the butt, faster than that of the Monogatari series, and the story of reliving your college years over and over again can be quite boring. But I think they're trying to show that any small change in your life can lead to a drastically different outcome and a very different journey. This show definitely proves that anime is not a genre, but a medium that can really make people think and tell a great story/make a point. It's definitely a wild ride that isn't very easy to keep up with but once you've made it on (after the first couple of episodes and you're used to the pace) I'd say it's a worthwhile one.  
The art style is very different which makes it interesting. At first it feels crude and like a simple cartoon but once it starts using mixed media and its varities of seemingly random color, it feels refreshing as its totally different from most all anime. I could see a lot of people calling it pretentious, but that's typically an honor, to be so innovative that traditional anime watchers think you're trying too hard. The music was very fitting. Pretentious shows must have pretentious music such as classical orchestral pieces but the OP and ED are just absolutely fantastic. The OP has a happy go lucky vibe to it, just as younger people should look towards their future, and the ED has a more cool, inquisitive feeling that makes you think of introspection and finding yourself. 
The series is of many metaphors and takes a lot more thinking than your typical show. Shows that do this typically seem pretentious but in reality they're just trying to break the social norm of anime and prove anime not to be a genre of generic tropes and childish motifs. Tatami Galaxy's themes and setting are very adult so this show shouldn't make sense for a younger audience and should be enjoyed by older/intellectual people. Not saying younger people shouldn't try watching this show, it just probably won't suit them as it's very introspective and symbollic. There's no tsunderes, no fanservice, nothing from the bible of anime tropes that most anime have to follow to have success which makes it very refreshing and unique. Of course it's not the first show to do this and have the themes of hardships and finding your place in the world, but it still manages to feel very unique. I don't think any casual anime watcher should watch this show because you can't just turn off your brain and accept the plot. You have to really dig deep to obtain value from most episodes as it doesn't have comedy to push you through and it's not straightforward. I would highly suggest this show to people who search for depth of meaning in media.

I have two issues with this anime and they bothered me so much I often found I couldn't enjoy what I was watching.  
**No Plot Spoilers Ahead** 
My major issues  
-. They consistently sexualize the protagonists throughout the series. This is a common trope in many anime's, but the problem is that the protagonists are CHILDREN!!! These kids are around the ages of ----- and are consistently shown naked or in sexual situations.  
This is both gross and unnecessary. It made me as a viewer feel uncomfortable and added nothing to the plot. If it wasn't for the ability to skip past these scenes I would have quit watching. 
-. The protagonists are children doing things that would kill most adults. Throughout watching this I just kept thinking how making the kids --- years older would fix this show. Imagine a child scaling Mount Everest...that's what this show feels like sometimes.  
Story 
-. Sometimes it gets lost in what it is trying to accomplish, but it keeps you coming back for more. 
Art & Sound 
-. Probably the two best aspects of the show. It is one of the most beautiful anime's i've ever seen. 
Character 
-. Not gonna lie sometimes the characters in this show do things that just don't make any sense.

This is one of the rare anime out there which exudes poetic brilliance. It is very disheartening to see when people talk about anime, they think mostly action/shounen. I think the slice of life genre is much more bountiful and enjoyable than those popular shounen anime that people watch. And this anime reiterated that view. 
While I rate an anime the order of rating is Animation, Music, Story, Characters, Enjoyment. There is a reason behind that order. It is in this order that an anime catches my attention. And it is in the reverse order that an anime ""continues"" to catch my attention. Nagi no Asakura caught my attention due to its out of the world visuals. They are nothing like I had seen before in any ""completed"" anime. I realized it had huge similarities to Glasslip, a currently airing show and I was right. They are from the same studio. However contrary to Glasslip, this anime is not slow and the fantasy elements are interwoven with the story beautifully. The opening music is beautiful, the in-anime music captivating, both of them caught my attention while watching the first episode. But by the end of the -st episode the animation and music took a back seat in my mind, it was the story and lovely characters that stole the show, as it should be. This is a story where ""fantasy meets reality"" was portrayed at its best. Clannad after story was a better as a story but the fantasy part was not portrayed very clearly and that led to many complaints. However this story does not pretend to an ordinary slice of life. It starts off underwater with clear indications it is more of a fantasy story. However there are subtle elements of real life that make it rise above a children's fairy tale. Hints of class divide, the changing environment of earth due to human activities, the fundamental difference between childhood and adulthood and coping with the everchanging surroundings are magnificently and subtly included in the fantastic plot. The plot features a time leap as well and the social difficulties arising from it is shown in a very beautiful way. All said and done, its the characters that stole the show. They may be slightly stereotyped but that does not make them less lovable. The complexities of adolescence of kids are included in the character traits of each character and you feel you have seen them before somewhere in real life. However the greatest feature of this anime is the climax which occurs at the very last episode. You go through all the emotions of joy, sorrow,hopelessness, optimistic, despair and end up with happiness. When bad things happen you seem to be always hoping against hope that in the end it will be alright. However at the very end of the -nd last episode I had honestly almost given up, but then the ending tied everything so beautifully that I was amazed. It was the most heartwarming ending I have seen in any anime, ever. People complain that status quo was reverted but for me the ending showed how people moved on with their lives in spite of all the difficulties. 
Verdict- My longest review should tell you by now how influenced I was with this one. It is the best Slice of Life I have seen in the last few months after Usagi drop. Everybody will thoroughly enjoy this one, thats a gurantee. 
Rating? Well lets see, I am a bit overwhelmed but still.. Animation---/--, Music--, Story--, Characters--, Enjoyment--- (--/--) which puts it in my top --.

Overall, this has been a positive year so far. Lots of really strong series, nothing too bad. Obviously, that had to change at some point. Which is why we find ourselves looking at the follow up to Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan, a terrible anime from Hal film maker about an angel who beats her love interest to death, brings him back to life and that's basically the big joke that we kept getting. I'm not looking forward to this one, but let's move in and see how many more gruesome domestic abuse scenes they can cram in and treat as humorous.  
Story: 
We pick up where the last series left off. Sakura is living with the angel sisters, Dokuro and Zakuro.  He's trying to live a normal life and get the attention of the girl he likes at his school but that's consistently ruined by Dokuro torturing and murdering him, but it's okay because she brings him back to life afterwards and that makes it funny because... people dying horribly and gruesomely is hilarious according to this series.  
The humour is much the same kind of thing that the first series offered. We have gross out humour with the over the top gore effects and perverted humour that's really used more as an excuse to show Dokuro and Zakuro in skimpy outfits than it is for actual comedic attempts. This is one of those series that seems to be based firmly on the idea that sex and violence sell and you don't need any charm or clever witticisms. After all, even semi-clever jokes would have interfered with this OVA's mission to route your blood flow away from the brain. The humour is also quite repetitive with Dokuro getting angry and mutilating or murdering Sakura with little or no provocation. It really shouldn't be possible for a joke to get stale with less than an hour of content, but they manage. So, does this one have any legitimately funny moments at all? Personally, I thought that Corpse Party did the over the top violent humour much better and it wasn't trying to be funny.  
Characters: 
This cast of characters is pretty horrendous. I'll give comedic series some leeway when it comes to character complexity since they really only need to play off of each other well for comedic purposes, but this cast doesn't even have that much going for them. We get the same few unfunny pay-off reactions repeated.   
Art: 
The artwork is pretty lazy with fountains of blood gore effects, really basic character designs and minimal backgrounds. The most effort they put in is for the tacky fan-service scenes. Which shouldn't be surprising after the first series.  
Sound: 
Like the first series, the theme tune is easily the best aspect of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan -. However, it is weakened a bit by being a pretty lazy remix of the first series' theme tune. Rather like Toei did with Futari Wa Precure: Max Heart. The acting is either obnoxiously exaggerated or emotionless and dull, depending on which character is speaking. Which is a pity since there are some really good actresses here. Chiba Saeko, to give an example, voiced Nina in Code Geass, Azmaria in Chrno Ctrusade & Natsuki in Mai-Hime/Otome. She can give such strong performances. It just doesn't happen here because there's nothing to work with.  
Ho-yay: 
There are some “jokes” that imply that Zansu is romantically interested in Sakura. Aside from that, there's really not any.  
Final Thoughts: 
This series is not good, at all. It's crude, tacky and generally tasteless with the same basic jokes the first OVA had. So, if you're a fan of the gross out/ fan-servicey humour, you might get a kick out of it otherwise, I would stay far away. For myself, I was not amused. I was quickly annoyed by the series and tired of its nonsense. I give Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan - a -/--.  Next week we'll move away from sequels and talk about Charlotte.

How do I describe Non Non Biyori? It's one of the few animes, in my opinion, that are truly flawless. I'm a very picky person about what anime I enjoy. Upon pursuing watching this anime per the recommendations of another fellow MAL user, I was quickly gripped by this anime. If you're looking for an action packed brawler anime, this one's not for you. But if you're looking for a stress free and heart warming anime that follows the simple things in life, then this is an anime for you. I've laughed aloud, I've smiled, I've cried at happy points and at sad points. This is one of few anime I confidently stand by the belief is without any flaw to it. From the beautiful art, the tranquil and mood appropriate music to the heart warming dialogue of characters, this anime has my heart gushing with warm emotions and I strongly recommend this anime to anyone looking for an anime that speaks to the heart. 
Update: 
Since I've finished this series, I can now give my own comprehensive review of the series: 
After finishing all -- episodes, I can safely say my opinion of the series has not dropped, a flawless ten all the way. 
Story: The story overall is wonderful and simple. There's no attempts at complex story hooks instead favouring emotional tie ins and expands on characters lives. Without writing spoilers, the episodes are fairly self-contained and can be watched independently. 
Art: The artwork is simply awe inspiring. The characters are well written and scenery is so beautifully drawn and coloured in it really left a sense of warmth in my heart when queued with the OST of Non Non Biyori. 
Sound: The voices, sound effects and music are really what builds this anime. The voices are all unique and distinctive, the sound effects like the locusts chirping in the background really sets a feeling of oneness with yourself when watching it. This is only strengthened by the very appropriate soundtrack from gentle piano, sweet recorder music or upbeat tracks in happy moments. It's a great soundtrack in every respect and it really helps draw you in. 
Characters: The characters are all distinctive personalities. From the tsundere Kaede, the sleepy headed Kazuho to the inquisitive and sweet Renge. Every single character displays a diverse personality that makes each one memorable in their own way. 
Enjoyment: As you can tell from this gushing with nothing but praise review, I have enjoyed this anime and it really sparked me into an appreciation for the Slice of Life genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it to you. From moments of hectic scenes and silly scenes to serious heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, this anime will keep your heart pumping with diverse emotions.

In theory canibalism, rape, breasts (well not really--why not watch porn instead?) and violence might be okay (good?) to see in a  movie. But this is fucking awful. The way it is presented makes it completely unenjoyable. If you have ever seen an action movie before...well, it doesn't matter, there isn't even any real action here. ...So Boring... 
The voice acting in this show is easily the worst I have ever heard. It is probably humanly impossible to be as unenthused as the voice actors on the english dub. Though, this may have been one of the few pros of the movie: I might've laughed at some of incredibly bad parts if I weren't so tired and bored. Well, probably not. I'm just being nice. None of it was that funny.  
Avoid.  
--- 
Edit: Sorry, I don't think I said how much this sucks, strongly enough. How is this rated so high? Mars of Destruction is more offensive than this??? Not really. 
There is no reason to rate this even moderately high. This is not filling some kind of void. Similar, enjoyable, ""more extreme"" movies already exist. Just Google Search: 'Category III' ..... 
Making a boring drama is one thing but a boring action short-movie. God. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Steins;Gate throws so many curveballs that it was a little difficult for me to keep track.  This was especially the case for the first episode (I had even considered rewatching this episode in particular just to wrap my head around the story and ease my mind, but the answers came in due time).  Nonetheless, these curveballs and plot twists were all what made the show so thrilling to watch.  I was at the edge of my seat for the first several episodes and for the last three, but the middle section had lost some of it's bite because it had seemed somewhat repetitive to me.  I'm not sure if it was because I can be dense at times or because I didn't pay too much attention to love interests, but I was a little shocked by one specific curveball:  a romantic pairing.  Throughout Steins;Gate, it was hinted that Okabe had feelings for two of the female main characters with heavy emphasis on one more than the other (most especially in the opening).  From the several scenes that exhibit these feelings, I thought to myself that either of the female characters would make a good pair with Okabe, but I assumed the that the one with more emphasis would be the one he ended up with.  But, in true Steins;Gate fashion, unbeknownst to me, a curveball was thrown my way.

I dunno why I waited so long to write a review but this is definitely worth reviewing. I gave Demon Slayer a -- when it ended but thinking about it for this review a - feels better because some things could've been better. These are all just little nitpicks tho I totally adore this show. 
I think instead of waiting until the final episode to go deeper into Muzan's character he should've been developed a little earlier. The show could've been more intense if we knew how bad Kibitsuji was from early on. But seeing his evilness at the end makes the future of Demon Slayer more interesting so I see why it was done that way.  
Also this show was a little too episodic for me to call it a masterpiece. That's probably the main reason im rating - instead of --. I like shows more when everything ties together a bit more. Giving every villain an innocent back story got kind of old as well. There's no reason to make us feel bad for every bad guy. 
Obviously the animation and art is amazing I enjoyed looking at every moment. There is some CGI but it's done right where you barely notice it and it's not during big moments. This show is a great example of how CGI should be done. No complaints there. I usually don't mention voice acting but it was definitely good. 
Hopefully we don't have to wait too long to get some more of this because this could turn into an all-time great if the mangaka can keep building on it. Sometimes the hype dies down when we have to wait too long like Attack on Titan.

*THE RATINGS FOR THIS ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PART, BUT THE REVIEW IS FOR THE OVERALL SERIES* 
[STORY: --/--] 
The Monogatiri series comes together well to create a masterpiece of a story. This show is much deeper than alot of people think. It is filled to the brim with philosophical arguments and great storytelling. The focus isn't mainly on action, though it does have some visually stunning action scenes. Alot of the time, it will just be conversations between characters, but this is the blood that keeps this series alive and flourishing. Without it, you'd have a normal show with above average production. This type of show isn't for everyone, but I personally love it. 
[ART: --/--] 
The animators went all out animating this show, as detail and flamboyance embody the artistic direction of this show. Each character's design and set piece is carefully planned out, and it shows.  
[SOUND: --/--] 
The voice actors become their characters when they act them out, that's how into them they get. They really care about their role, you can tell. And sound effects are well done as well, nothing seems off in that department. 
[CHARACTER: --/--] 
Most every character is important to the main plot of the story and if they aren't a main character, the style of the show makes it seem as if they don't even exist. Whether they be designed as set pieces or outlines, the show really puts emphasis on those we really care about. These characters are no joke either, pretty much none of them are one-dimensional wastes of time, which is very appeciated. 
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: --/--] 
Though some parts of the series are better than others, the series as a whole is truly an amazing body of work that I consider a masterpiece. This story is filled to the brim with beautifully crafted characters, artwork, sound design, and an amazing story that philosophically challenges the observer to think. A masterful work by Isin Nisio.

I was -- years old when i first started watching Naruto. I originally started watching it hesitantly because i thought anime was stupid but the minute I watched it I was like okay episode - was okay, episode - was a little bit better and so on so forth. My only problem really with the original Naruto is the Art and Sound but that mainly has to do with the how old the show was and what I was used to as a kid growing up in the ----'s. The story is original and I can sympathize with anyone who had to wait two long years for the Sequel. If you really like shows that have to do with massive character development Naruto is for you. Plus the music is pretty good. Anybody with time should definitely watch Naruto.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
Well, when I got intro this series people promised me it will be dark, brutal, evil... 
- eps into this and I felt bored af, quit this anime a few times, never could make it to the end. People were saying ""Yo dude, wait for ep-. That shit is one of most gruesome evil shit bla bla bla"". And what do I get? Dissapoinment. I was like ""eh? That's it? What???"" Enough talking about it. 
Story: Story so far is pathetic. Leaked conversation between producers and other people:  
""Let's put some cute girls to make people think show is cute and than add some 'dark' moments in the show so everyone will talk about it, cause they will think this was supposed to be cute"" 
""Yeah, let people think it will be the most gruesome thing ever, let them think that hehAHEAHEHAEHH""  
""Let's kill one of characters that we made up just for that moment with some poor 'witch'"" 
And so on.... I kept watching only cause it seemed promising cause of people's reviews, but NO, it's bad and you will want to quit after episode -. I barely managed to watch it till episode -. I dropped this anime - times till then. -/-- 
Art: Well, did you ever have an acid trip, or you were bored in class so you started drawing random creepy/dumb things? Well, this is exactly it. Almost got epilepsy and my eyes are hurting as hell. Not to mention that characters look like a fucking plate. -/-- 
Sound: Well, this is only thing I kinda liked in this show. Only outro, cause it sounded nice with good rhythm, but lyrics are bad, so it's -/--. 
Character: This is one of the worst characters I ever saw with no character development or anything. Just girls randomly talking and ""killing witches"". Not to mention putting a supportive character just so you could kill it and change the main character's mind and will. And there is that one character (I even forgot her name) that is childish, playing hot and cold games, like ""Oh I see you - together talking so that means you love each other and now I will run away so you will feel sorry for me."" 
Enjoyment: As I said I dropped this anime - times till finishing episode -, and even the strongest wall can break sometimes, so I quit. I got so surprised at how boring and dumb this overrated anime was, so I had to write this review. 
Overall: This was one of the worst show I ever saw, cause of influence of everybody saying ""Yo look at this shit, it's lit/bad/evil/cute..."" 
NO, just no. You will just waste your time if you start watching this. This is how I learned to never trust people on internet talking about which anime is good and which isn't.

To put it bluntly Heavy object is scattered.  
The story in itself, character design, mood, art etc all isn't that bad alone but overall it just doesn't feel whole. This is strongly emphasized by the setting of military states battling each other with massive ""object"" war machines that require crews of hundred people to maintain, large home bases to set up and billions of units of cash to create then being contrasted with a duo being assigned time and time again to work together (this should never happen), single pilot being assigned to this war machine (common mecha trope, but makes even less sense in Heavy objects setting), just plain makes so many odd simplifications about warfare while trying to have grim serious world it is weird (Seriously, the objects main guns can easily destroy other objects but satellites/long range missile systems with the ability haven't been developed what??)  
All this boils down to a world that feels very unreal and like it is a mosaic of pieces that don't really fit together.  
Things I liked: 
- Milinda Brantini, she was cute, I liked the pilot suit designs overall, very lovable girl.  
- The The sexy secretary girls aka every high ranking female officer in the series. More or less just fan service, though. There could be something said for Froylatia and some others but in the end I don't really think that any female character is really well done as a character in the series. They are all more or less male fantasy tropes, in the end. (Not to say they don't have good moments.) 
- The objects themselves were quite cool.  
- The fire fights were cool time to time.  
As you can see good points pretty much come down to fan service and flashy animation. Considering my favorite parts about the show were Milinda's and Qwenthurs baby love it tells a lot. (But there sadly wasn't a lot of it.) It pretty much isn't worth the watch unless you are coming from the manga or novel and liked those a lot, or you just have the free time to watch endless number or B-grade anime.

This season of Haikyuu was consistent in terms of the qualities Haikyuu has presented so far. 
But I'd also like to note that due to its length and enviroments being pretty much stuck in one place due to this season consisting of a really long match, this season of Haikyuu will feel more like a long high budget OVA than a new season. It is a continuation of where it has left off previously, with the finals between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa, the match taking the entire length of this season. There's no new story elements, and the character development that the characters got is now presented in how the characters evolved, especially a specific character. And just like the other matches of Haikyuu, it focuses on presenting the opponents as well, with the series taking time to explain the motivation and strengths of most key characters in the team. The third season is pretty much the culmination of the character development the characters went through, as well as the presentation of the team of Shiratorizawa, and that's pretty much why the series is so long, and also why it feels like an OVA. It doesn't serve anything new or unexpected, but presents the facets of the series that its fans enjoyed, which is what I think the ideal OVA should be. And as a result of such I consider this season to be good, because it seems well aware of what works in well in Haikyuu. 
The match itself is fun, it presents Karasuno's versatility and willingness to try new things against a team that has honed their skills in a strong and consistent style to overpower their opponents. While this may make Shiratorizawa sound like a boring team, since this means that mostly Karasuno's players will try to make interesting outlandish plays, Shiratorizawa's team players all have different skills and capabilities, and its the presentation of those skills that is the entertainment value coming from that team, as the team also values individual talent and the ability to score, over necesarily having strong teamplay. So you'll have a player who's a very strong spiker, one who's a very strong blocker, and other such examples. 
In terms of drama, I still think Haikyuu is a tad ridiculous, but it didn't really have the opportunity to be overlydramatic this season, because its main focus was a more subdued character in terms of presenting his development and that behaviour helping in relieving a bit of the overcompetitiveness that kinda bothers me in Haikyuu. The overlycompetitive nature of Haikyuu is mostly an issue of the former seasons, so I won't go on talking about it. 
The animation is consistent and looks as good as it always did, but I assume the fact that they didn't really animate any other locations than two places is due to budget constraints. However, the animation didn't go on a downwards spiral in terms of quality, it's just as fluid and detailed as always. The OST from what I heard was recycled, so there shouldn't be any changes that should unnerve you. Even if there were changes and I'm wrong, I couldn't notice it, and as such, the OST is at least very similar in style and there shouldn't be any problem caused since it's the same thing.  
To end things, I still think its likely that if you enjoyed Haikyuu, you will enjoy this season, and if you didn't, this season won't change your mind. I don't believe that Haikyuu has either risen or declined in quality, and the reason it is well received is because its fans are being delivered the things it has had set up and the things it has prepared it for. Which any good series should know how to do and Haikyuu did. Just be aware of how much you've enjoyed the series so far before starting this season.

Pupa is BY NO MEANS perfect. However, i don't believe it deserves the flack it is getting. 
I watched this immediately after watching Corpse Party. (I was in the mood for some violence) I am saying this to tell you that when i sat down to watch Pupa i was wanting and expecting violence. 
STORY 
POSITIVES 
I thought it was genuinely sweet how the brother and the sister cared so much for eachother. If you watch the last episode first, it shows this pretty well. 
I also think that their relationship with each other was an interesting take on the disease they both had and how they dealt with it. 
STORY 
NEGATIVES 
There were many aspects of the story that were . . . . inconsistent or missing. Firstly, both of them have the disease but only one of them shows the symptom of craving human flesh. 
Next, the dog at the very beginning of the show was never explained. The little girl had the disease since birth so what was the relevance of the dog? Why did THAT trigger what it did? 
Also, these siblings had been together through thick and thin. They had abusive parents and led a very harsh life. So why is it that neither of them had realised they had regenerative abilities until they were in highschool. Why did neither of them seem to eat people before the start of the show? 
Just the fact that everything starts when it does is just convenient to the plot. 
Moving away from the siblings, another one of the main plots involving the witch is never followed up on! I genuinely wanted to know where that was going! Maybe to know to witches backstory too! Maybe if the show was -, -- minute OVAs and not --, - minute mini-sodes, it wouldve been better in that aspect. 
ART 
POSITIVES 
Any show that has very little / no censorship gains bonus points with me as well because when i watch a horror, i want to see the blood and gore. Good job Pupa! 
ART 
NEGATIVES 
The art style is pretty un-inspired and alot of looping of animations was used to cut costs. 
SOUND 
POSITIVES 
Nothing special.

NEGATIVES

CHARACTER 
POSITIVES 
Some people may think that the overly devoted siblings troph are un-inspired and annoying. I think its sweet especially with the last episode. 
CHARACTER 
NEGATIVES 
The characters relationship means very little unless you watch the last episode and even then, it still may not satisfy many viewers. 
ENJOYMENT 
POSITIVES 
I went in wanting violence and really didnt care much about the story. 
ENJOYMENT 
NEGATIVES 
I was still left disappointed at the end. I wish there was more really. 
OVERALL 
Pupa is something you may watch if you are looking for excessive violence, into cannibalization in your shows, don't care much about story, and/or want a very fast show to watch. I fell under every single on of those categories so i enjoyed it enough. Im glad i watched it but i won't be watching it again. If there was more to it, i would've given it a much higher rating. Too bad they leave you hanging on so much. 
If you like this review, check out some of my others! Tell me what you think! ^_^

Before the start of the fall anime season, Junni Taisen was one of the animes that caught my eye. The reason why is because it had the term Novel on what material it was adapted from. As in it wasn’t a light novel series or a regular novel series, but rather it was one single novel. As in all it needed to do has been done, and all that’s left is to adapt it to animation that has an ending in sight that will leave little to no loose ends. What started as mild intrigue was quickly overtaken with dissatisfaction as the first two episodes rolled around.  
Juuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best “warriors” in the world. The gimmick in this story is that each the the contenders is representative of each of the chinese zodiac. Add on top of that a desolate city where the contenders can do whatever they want, and you have a formula for some fun. It may not be the most smartest of stories, but it has the ability to bring many great fighting scenes which sadly never becomes the case. 
Backstories and their utilization 
One of the most noticeable aspects of this show, mostly because of how much time it takes from the show, is that it has a lot of backstories. Almost every episode has a backstory for one of the characters which is fine, I mean there are -- characters and only -- episodes worth of screen time for them. The problem is that each backstory is too long, and even worse is that it's the only shreds of characterization that we have for almost all the characters. I mean i’m fine with backstories as a way to develop a character and give them more depth, but it should be used as the base not the entirety of the character. It’s because of this that all the characters feel shallow, and it’s difficult to get engaged with them which in turn removes a lot of tension that could have been given to the anime.  
It’s also because of the overuse of backstory that during my time watching I began to wonder, how are backstories are used in a story? One of the answers i came to is the one i used a paragraph above, as a way to develop a character and give them some depth while serving as a base and point of reference for how far they have or haven’t changed through the course of the story. It could as be used as a way for characters to interact as a way to sympathize or persuade each other, as well as the characters and readers getting a chance to know the characters. Now how are they are inserted into the story? Well as stated above it could be through character interaction, but another way is through characters reminiscing over their past. A majority of Junni Taisen’s implementation of backstory is through reminiscing, which also becomes another of its faults. Reminiscing over your past is better used during the low points in the story when there is not much conflict and characters are allowed time to think about things without interruption. However since Junni taisen is mostly conflict it seems unreasonable for characters to think about their past, since they should be more busy thinking of strategy plans. It’s only used properly twice and that’s because it was before and after the battle royal, which is basically the low point, and it also does backstory via character interaction maybe once. All  other backstories feel hamfisted into the story as a way to give the characters some form of depth. They should have also thrown in a record scratch and a freeze frame before delving into their backstories because at least that would give them some value even if comedic. Even worse is what comes after each backstories that turn the show into a bore which leads to.  
Character focus and the wheel of predictability 
Junni Taisen doesn’t really have a central that the story focuses on, but insteads puts focus on almost the entire cast, with each given an episode each. It did comes as quite the surprise during the first episode when only one character was given the most focus to, as well as a backstory, to the point that it was made to believe that they were the main character. Of course that thought was dashed away as they died in the very same episode. It was a nice subversion of expectations, but the problem is that it didn't go anywhere with this. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again with each character. If they are the main focus of the episode, and are given a backstory than they are likely to die soon. It may not be in the same episode, but they still die in a certain manner that holding back their death for an episode or - didn’t really matter. Another thing to add on top of that is the order that the characters die. All you need to do is look at the chinese zodiac wheel and after the death of the three contenders, it’s easy to see how the show is going to play out. 
It seems that the people of the show were aware of the predictability of the show, and made heavy hints on how it will play out via the ending title, and the name of each episode. Even so it really adds nothing to the show. The show tells you what it’s going to do and does it, and does nothing else. It’s fine but leaves nothing for the viewers imagination, and removes even more tension from the show. With a predictable story and shallow characters, it’s hard to see the point in the story as it drags on. 
the fuckery of the junni taisen world 
The world of juuni taisen doesn’t make any fuckin sense. At first there wasn’t much to the world other than a group of assassins wearing costumes corresponding to their zodiac animal meeting in the middle of a desolate city to duke it out in order to have their wishes granted by the host. Gimmicky and simple sure, but it allows for things to be straightforward and brush of things that are never explained such as, how are they able to fight in a city that seemed to be abandoned recently? Well if they are able to gather the best killers in the world than they must be stinkin rich which also could explain how they are able to grant a wish and have people evacuate the city, via money and power. However in the same first episode near the end magic is also introduced through the use of necromancy. So that leaves questions that weren’t questioned now difficult to explain because now the wish and the the abandoned city could have been explained with magic or money, but it seems the writers weren’t bothered now to actually explain it. 
So now you have a world where there is some sort of magic in the world and the contenders are able to use them, but it seems that one ability is restricted to one character each. It’s never explained why only one ability or how abilities such as theirs play in the world outside of people being assassins. It also leads to a power imbalance as it could be possible for one of the characters to have an op ability that can beat the rest of the contenders.  
I think the thing that bothered me more was the entire point of junni taisen was that it served as a proxy war so that unknown people can make bets to take counties, and the whole thing is just dumb. There’s been enough flashbacks from the series to show us that there is still war between nations and fighting over land outside the battle royal. Is there going to be a change of government are borders going to be redrawn especially for something that happens every -- years. Even then it’s not like the citizens will be happy which can lead to civil unrest and rebellion. 
I was also going to go into the -- families and the happenstance of the character aesthetics to their respective zodiac, but at this point it’s too much. Basically as more about the juuni taisen world is shown the more convoluted and contradictory it really is. It looks like a bunch of things slapped together with not much thought in the big picture.  
Production Value and other final thoughts 
The production value during the beginning was fine to say the least. I liked the character designs of the warriors mostly because of how gimmicky they are just so they can be identifiable to their zodiac. Although backstory boars combat outfit looked nice as it had a metal gear look to it. The animation was smooth although it had a rough looked to it which i personally liked even some of the cg animation was good. But that’s just the beginning as the quality in terms of both art and animation go down. Animation starts to look jagged and cg is used even though the characters are standing around which looks ridiculous. In terms of sound there’s nothing to harp about as most of it was forgettable. Characters sound like how they’re supposed to sound, and music play when it’s suppose to, but nothing truly stands out. 
Going into this show i was at least expecting some action shlock, but it seems that wasn't the case. There were interesting things in the show for sure such as the backstories which themselves could make interesting stories, but they are confined to this one. There was also some “witty” writing when it came to the characters and what they represent, but nothing mind blowing. This is a show that said it will do a thing, did it, and nothing more.

for anyone who enjoys season -, would definitely enjoy season - as well. 
i personally don't really enjoy the first season and thinking back, i could not remember much about the first season except the girl kept on having someone falls in love/have a crush on/confessed to her and the story development almost made me drop the series (it made me think ''ahh..is this another anime that had one girl surrounded by lots of guys and everyone liking her..blablabla.."") but i continued because the anime had humour and the characters expressions were funny.. 
and so it took me this long to actually start watching and recently finished watching season -. season - is great in my opinion because of the back story and thus showing characters development. this also exudes a promising -rd season with all the stories the series have yet to tell and offer. not to mention, despite being only a -- episode anime series, there are several events that happened in the series so you will not find the flow of the series mundane. the excitement andhumour does not wears off and you should be able to watch the series continuously. 
in short, the story is good and have great art with easy to your ears soundtracks..the characters also shows a lot of development and i want to know what will happen to them in the future. i enjoy the series enough to make me write a review (just because it changed my perception from the previous season) and would recommend this to anyone seeking that cute 'kyaa!' or 'awww, so sweet...' moment..

After watching Pupa, I thought can there be something even worse. Then I found this Anime. 
First of all your just thrown into the world without any real introduction and you're wondering what this is all about. I think the main idea could be something fine. But it seems like they are trying to cramp as much information as possible in this one episode. Most likely because the animation was so bad that they first had no chance to get the permission for continuing the series. Anyway, it must be said that the Dub was OK but not the best I've ever heard. But, I was pretty annoyed by the distorted sound every time there were someones voice coming out a speaker. 
After watching this Anime I'm not sure if the source material is that bad too or if just the attempt creating an Anime has just gone that wrong.

This review will include spoilers! 
I'll admit, Reverse Harem anime's are my guilty pleasure and every so often I watch one on a whim and I usually walk away feeling disappointed, both in the show and in myself but sometimes the feelings I'm left with are anger and disgust.  
Amnesia is the latter. So let's break this down.  
Story: -/--  
The story is honestly one of the more disappointing aspects of this show. The premise is interesting and the caveat of the protagonist having to try and figure out which new timeline she's in in order to avoid completely messing everything up is probably better utilized in the original game as here it simply results in her looking confused --% of the time and being totally useless the other -- percent.  
None of the individual time lines are fleshed out before the protagonist invariably finds herself near death and in a new universe again.  
There are many much better Time Travel/Alternate Universe hopping anime out there.  
There was only really one relationship covered in the show that felt rewarding or good at all and it ends well before it reaches any sort of satisfying... well anything.  
Art: -/--  
The Art is pretty but nothing to write home about, the boys are inevitably attractive enough. Really nothing to report here. The only aspect that stands out at all is that the female protagonist's design is at least marginally different from most generic otome game girls.  
Sound: -/--  
Again nothing to write home about, honestly I don't remember much of anything about the music or sound design, which can only mean it wasn't horrible enough to warrant remembering.  
Character: -/--  
The characters are bad, worse than usual reverse harem fair. Our protagonist is generic, has no personality so you can project yourself onto her, reverse Harem girl. A trope I wish, quite frankly would die. She's also useless, helpless and probably going to die by stupidity.  
The main boys are, frankly, horrible. Only one of them (Kent) seemed to care at all about what the protagonist wanted and was willing to work with her to better their relationship and his is the shortest story line.  
The least offensive of the remaining boys are boring at best, and irritating at worst. They include a boy with a fan club that he just lets harass main girl, in Ikki and Shin who is a childhood friend and is protective but mostly leaves our protagonist to her own devices to die by literally everything. (Unlike his older brother whom I will touch on in a moment.) 
The other two are, well, abusive. This is a trope I see gaining lots of traction in Reverse Harem/Otome game animes and it's frankly angering and very very terrifying. These boys are never called out on it and indeed garner their own fanbases.  
Toma (Shin's older brother) Literally locks our protagonist in a cage, against her will, for her protection. But not before he drugs her into sleeping for two weeks straight. AND THE PROTAGONIST IS A-OKAY WITH ALL OF THIS!  
Ukyo is the last of the potential love interests and unfortunately the one the anime tries to convince us is the best choice in boyfriend. Ukyo suffers from split personality disorder, that he gave himself, by dying multiple times over trying to save our protagonist. This second personality tries to kill our protagonist at literally every turn. Which is (warning, incoming sarcasm) soooo romantic.  
Orion is the only remotely interesting character and he gets sidelined so often  the show just gives up on ever doing anything with him.  
In summary: Amnesia is bad, it's worse than bad, it's disgusting, pro-abuse, and definitely harmful to young girls. The only thing it made me feel for any of the boys is how much I wish the anime was about her and Kent only.  
Skip it, and for the love of god, don't glorify Toma!

Akira is known to be a masterpiece that changed anime as it is today, and where I can agree that it definitely did change anime I just can't see why. Akira has an interesting plot but the execution is done poorly in my opinion. Now for those of you that are mad that I'm bashing on Akira calm down, I enjoyed the movie and saw why it is popular, I just didn't see why it was so popular. The movie has some parts I really liked about it, the main character Kaneda, the battle between Tetsuo and Kaneda, the fluid animation, the ending, etc. The animation was fantastic but, seeing every character have the same face really destroyed the credibility of the animation in my eyes. The sound was nice and the editing was great, but when it comes to a soundtrack there wasn't really anything that stood out to me. When it comes to the story it was good, but not great, I found myself being lost in the movies confusing pacing. But by the last hour of the movie I figured everything out and was sincerely enjoying it. I loved the ending I think it ended perfectly and I think the ending alone pushed the movie up to a - for me. In conclusion Akira is good movie, but that's all I got from it, I didn't see why it should be in talks for greatest anime movie and I didn't see why it was so influential

Lovers of all things anime will appreciate everything the art form has to offer and will not only rejoice when a series is absolutely stunning, but will also prepare themselves to derail and destroy the series that are absolutely dreadful. Of course, I'm being subjective, because whether you've seen every anime ever or maybe one type of anime, you are an anime lover. If you've seen this anime, you are a disappointed anime lover... 
*SIGH* Enough brooding. One of the worst anime original home videos that exists in my opinion is Lily C.A.T.  
Lily C.A.T. is a science fiction/horror anime OVA from the ripe age of horrible anime like this one. The film follows the spaceship on a ---year mission. Under the instructions of an unknown force (that remains unknown and is never address again throughput the entire anime) the ship's A.I. computer system accidentally introduces an alien bacterium into the ship while its human crew is in cryostasis. Naturally, both the ship and the unknown force want to eradicate the bacterium from the ship but also to cover up for this blunder. And that's what sets the plot into disarray. 
You have a misfit crew that doesn't get along at all and only wants to look out for their own selfish goals and they are attacked by man-killing bacteria that took over a cat. You can already see it coming. The story is typical horror; the mysterious, scary, evil pursuer picks off the crew one by one.  The alien wants the humans dead. But that's not too bad, it's mundane, but typical horror, but so can still keep watching. 
But when you look at the characters, things start to get much, much worse. My main gripe with the characters is that not one of them, except the obvious couple, Hiro and Nancy, get along. Not one of these idiots. It's as if the writers made them forget that a dangerous, life-erasing bacterium is gunning for them, and they need to work together to survive. Then there's Hamilton, who defines the meaning of determination so hard, it has to be seen to be believed. It's very... BAD! None of the characters were in their right mind. In my eyes, characters as simple-minded as the ones in Lily C.A.T. deserve to be food for bacteria. Hamilton chases Hiro for pride, Hiro comes out of the blue as a murderer without any evidence that he was beforehand, and a complete lack of any backstory to boot, Nancy acts like a schoolgirl for almost the entire anime, Hiro comes off as a bad stereotypical stoic, Carolyn is awful, and for one member of the crew, it's so obvious he's not gonna make it, you consider him dead meat right after his first speaking line. It's all pathetic. One more thing, Guy is the only black male in this crew. His position like other characters that weren’t the cop, the heroine or the lead males Hamilton and Hiro was debatable, and that says enough on its own. 
The sound is of a typical, outdated film type. The --'s muddled, low sound effects, the cheesy --'s music, even the characters wear clothes from the --'s IN A STORY SET -- YEARS IN THE --RD CENTURY. Damn.  The dub is awful as well. 
If it isn't a secret by now, Lily C.A.T. delivers a crushing, gut-wrenching, horrible experience for the viewer. It contains your fan service-like but action girl and the blood and guts that defined those ovas of the time, complete with a sub-par, but passable plot that is ruined by unsettled characters and holes that pop up in pivotal scenes (Pay attention to the background check interviews and Hamilton himself-- Believe me). To top it off, in order to screw with the viewer more there are two things from an actually good horror movie, Alien, that Lily C.A.T. adapts. Not going to spoil it or the ""ending"" as some might call it, but these elements that Lily C.A.T. graciously and proudly copies only complicate the story even more. It's almost a guaranteed re-watch to understand what is what and which is which, but this anime is not even worth the first time you see it-- it's a mediocre, gory, bloody, confusing mess. Its enjoyment factor is destroyed by its horridness and I'm dead serious. When Lily C.A.T. isn’t boring me in the opening, or disgusting me through the “jump scares” (they suck, really), it’s killing me throughout because it’s a painful, confusing and pointless mess. The characters even lampshade how pointless it is in the anime. I apologize for this drawn out review, but it’s better than wasting an hour watching the anime itself. Friends of mine have praised this series and call it a great horror anime. Some even claim it is an obscure buried treasure. The only place I want Lily C.A.T. buried is in the bottom of my crappy anime basket pile, never to see the light of day again. 
Creator_Kun's Score 
Story: The beef of my review;  The story is typical and even disoriented and confusing (-) 
Art: Nothing bad, nothing to get an eye-gasm over. Gore-galore. (-) 
Sound: Bad, but it was the late ----'s. This is the one area I can't rip Lily C.A.T. because it's not its fault. The English dub is god-awful  and poorly acted. (-) 
Characters: Gosh... (-) 
Enjoyment: I shake my head when I try to think of enjoyment an d Lily C.A.T. going together. (-) 
OVERALL: -- Bad.  I grace Lily C.A.T. with a blissful “-” rating. I recommend you stay away from this anime. If you really liked ""Alien"", give it a -. Otherwise, don't bother.

I Don't know who messed up in the info department, but this is not an anime! This would fall under Hentai/child porn (just because you say that a character is --- years old doesn't make it right) 
First thing you see is the main female in a swim suit then next thing you know it, she is striping! what does that tell you? 
Story -/-- 
There is no story. It is mostly Echi pics of the characters and some actual animation of the characters taking their close off and sexually getting on the main male. No intercourse is shown, but masturbation pics can be seen. 
Art  -/-- 
The art is decent. If there was a real good story put to the art style I'd watch it. 
Sound  -/-- 
When they made this they, clearly were not using a good mic. 
Character  -/-- 
The main female character is a several hundred year old fox who falls in love with a young teenage boy (boy is a loli so more pedo stuff their.)

Lol it's an F. I did not enjoy this at all. (It is because of the hentai/child porn.)

- months. That is how long it took me to actually get back into anime. I couldn't tell you why, but it took me forever to actually find an anime that would peak my interest to an extent in which I would appreciate the genre like I did before. Come mid-January, I saw one of my favorite YouTube anime reviewers (BlackCriticGuy) do a review on this very series here. I wondered to myself whether it could be that show that pushed to get back into the wonderful world of anime. 
I'll tell you what. It was. 
I had an absolute blast watching this show, and seeing all of the characters in the series interact with each other on such an emotional and captivating level. I had so much fun with this series, that watching scenes from the series again and again is practically a hobby of mine. I'm heavily planning on reading the manga and whatnot, as well as delving even more into the story. It's March, and I still can't get over this series. I love it. 
Huge props to TMS Entertainment, who did the phenomenal animation to this series. The character designs, while a bit basic and simple, were very interesting in their own way. I personally enjoyed seeing a mix between the chibi style of animation (which was occasionally used for comedic effect) and the regular animation, which would add more light-hearted moments to the story. 
The story of the series was absolutely lovely. Though the plot is heavily character-centric, the story itself does have a very unique tone to it that I cannot deny was incredible. The arcs, which generally delved into each of the characters in the main friends group, were each fascinating and captivating. I personally enjoyed learning about Kaizaki's past the most out of each of the characters, for his past was quite dark and heart-wrenching. Those scenes really touched me, as well as hurt me too. They were quite emotional for the characters and the viewers alike. I also enjoyed the arc concerning Rena Kariu and her role on the volleyball team. However, that arc was a bit long, which did annoy me a bit. 
Considering I'm talking so much about the characters, I guess I'll just start talking about them entirely. They were by far the best part of the series. I genuinely loved almost every character in the series (emphasis on almost), but I did have a few favorites. My personal favorite character in the entire series was easily Kaizaki Arata. I understand he's a generic main character who cares about each and every one of his friends and foes alike- I get that. But learning about him and what this poor man had to deal with before the ReLife experiment took over his life was absolutely awful to see. I really empathized with his character the most throughout anyone in the entire series. I also was a big fan of his love interest in the series, Hishiro Chizuru. I learned that a lot of people don't like her character, and though I do respect other people's opinions, I personally had so much fun learning about her as a person and how she ended up how she did. It was also really funny and cute to see her open up to people more. (Plus, the scenes in which she attempted to smile at people were really funny.) Finally, I would like to speak about Ryo Yoake, the man that gave Kaizaki the opportunity to work at ReLife in the first place. He was quite interesting, learning about why he chose Kaizaki to be his second experimental subject, and his relationship with another character (I would say, but that could possibly give away spoilers, just know that I find them to be cute together.) 
Though I had a blast with this series as a whole, a few problems did bother me throughout the series, which included a few characters, as well as a specific arc that I mentioned earlier. 
Do you remember earlier when I stated that I liked ALMOST every character in the series? Well, I personally didn't like the friends of Honoka, Rena's teammate. I don't even remember their names, which should simplify just how forgettable they were in the series. I don't hate them, it's just that we know absolutely nothing about them. 
I also did not appreciate how long Rena's volleyball arc was. I didn't hate it, but it was an issue that did need addressing. 
Regardless, I had a blast with this series, and if you have not seen this series yet, do yourself a favor. Check it out. I got back into something that I had avoided for - months because of this series, so if you are a hardcore fan that has not checked this series out yet, watch it. You will not regret it. 
I'm so glad that this was the first series that I had watched in forever. The little amount of nitpicks that I found with the series were so minuscule and superfluous that they barely do anything to ruin it. In fact, they weren't even that bad looking back on it now. They were quite okay, it's just that they could've been done much better. So yeah. I loved it. I really wish to see another anime like this in the coming months, so if you have, please reply to me and let me know what it is. I need to know. 
Considering that's all I have to say, I'm just going to end it here. 
Later!

There are -- existing reviews for this over-hyped anime so I don't really expect this review to be long lived and I'm quite happy that it will vanish into nothingness in -- hours at the most. 
I just need to vent some opinions I have about this anime. Did I mention it is over-hyped? Even for fanboys of this anime it must be over-hyped. With a fairly good story it tries to become a mecha version of Death Note and I suppose it succeeds to some extent, but not in a very intriguing manner really. The story has many twists and turns and it is quite entertaining at times, but the story can't save this anime from its characters. 
Every single character of this anime is bad, not even Lelouch is any good most of the time. Mostly because he's so overplayed. However Lelouch is nothing compared to Kurkrurururugi Suzaku. I was on the verge of dropping this anime at each and ever episode, even while watching the very last episode, because of Kurukgukgururui Suzaku, he was not fabulous to say the least. Apart from these two characters the rest of them were no catches either, I don't really feel like going through a list of bad characters so I'm just going to generalize and say they were the usual generic stereotypical blobs on screen fresh from the ""generic steretypical anime character factory"" that they copy and paste into their storyboard. 
Did you notice the CLAMP influences? Of course you did, I don't have anything against CLAMP, they've done XXXholic, but really? CLAMP in a shounen? No. 
In conclusion this animes screenplay is an abomination, which leaves character interaction between the incredibly boring characters wanting in such a terrible manner that it drags this entire anime down.

OreImo is back! Now with more fanservice and less fun! 
No but really, when I heard OreImo gets a second season I was pretty excited. I loved the first season, it was really entertaining and I had a blast with it. It wasn’t anything great but a good laugh and a lot of Otaku references. 
With season - though a lot of this changed. I’m not sure if it is me that changed or if A- Pictures is at fault, or even if the source material is not that good. But season - was the biggest disappointment of the year so far. 
Story/Content 
Kyouske and his sister Kirino are back, this time it revolved all around their relationship and more drama/romance as in contrast to the first season which had more comedy. 
It’s not that Season- didn’t have any comedy, but just not as much. 
The start is slow and not very good, it gets scattered episodes that are actually enjoyable only to mix in the ones that are bad. 
It just doesn’t work. The romance part of the show should a) not be with Kirino and her Brother and b) not so dramatic. 
Everything is just really unrealistic and over the top, you cannot make real drama seem appropriate in a show that is so nonsensical. It harmed the overall feel of the show big time and I was mostly at the verge of dropping it. 
Thank goodness the last episode was actually good, so I’m not writing this with fury but rather a calm disappointed aftertaste of what the show was in general. 
Characters 
While everyone was as they were in season -, it kinda felt like a magical reset. I know they want you to get into it again, but the feeling of starting from - was still there. 
We got some insight on other characters this time but nothing that had any impact on the show overall. 
I mean what was the point of a backdrop for Saori if she is missing most of the time? 
I mean nice to know what other people have as backdrop but in the end the focus was on Kirino. 
Even the hoped for romance between Kuroneko and Kyousuke was disappointing and went nowhere. 
And the worst of it all was Kirino, as she was a worse TSUNdere than ever. 
The focus was weak this season, everyone got a tiny bit only to be sacrificed by Kirino which pissed a lot of people off. 
Art and Animation 
The original was done by studio AIC, this time A- Picture did the job. 
Normally A- has pretty good production values, and it’s not like OreImo looked bad, but an average looking show can’t be helped. 
What we did get though were a lot of asses. 
I mean A- Pictures kinda needs to squeeze in a lot of Ass-Fanservice in every show they make, at least that’s what I see. 
It’s not really that it would ruin the show, since it is already not a serious show to begin with, so fanservice doesn’t ruin it. But the amount of it was definitely increased. 
The rest is the same, character designs look pretty bland, the sceneries are just as underwhelming, and animation is average stuff.   
Not the worst looking show of the season, but sure right in the middle of mediocre. 
Sound 
Even worse is the music in OreImo -. I can’t quite remember what it sounded like in season one, but I guess it wasn’t much better. 
The opening is cheezy and the general BGM just fitting but not great. 
Voice actors are you normal to good modern presentation. I mean we have Kana Hanazawa and Yuuichi Nakamura. They are all talented so yeah it’s good. 
Enjoyment 
Well apart from a few episodes or scenes season - was a let down. I sometimes even hated it and just wanted to throw my computer out the window on how bad it was. 
While the enjoyable episodes were good enough to fill my sparse free time with some good moments. 
The last episode really helped the show not to leave behind this image of the worst thing ever in my memory. 
But I guess this is it for me. If a season - comes out, nope thank you. It’s not worth it anymore and it lost its magic. 
Scores: 
Content -/-- 
Premise and Setting - (same as before, also not great)  
Genre Execution -- (compared to season - a failure) 
Dialogues and Cleverness - (not as funny as season - but had its moments) 
Interest keeping - (sometimes I thought I’d drop it, but then it saved it with a good episode) 
Characters -/-- 
Personality - (cliches but fun to watch) 
Behavior and Chemistry - (enjoyable from time to time) 
Development and Progression - (not really there) 
Motivation and Backdrop +- (we actually got some backdrop for some of the characters) 
Likability - (while some of them are very likable, Kirino is not) 
Art and Animation -/-- 
Artstyle - (generic) 
Quality - (okay) 
Background - (unremarkable) 
Character Designs -- (cheap looking) 
Visual Effects - (used not often) 
Sound -/-- 
Voice Acting +- (many talented people) 
Opening and Ending -- (waaaaay too cheesy) 
Soundtrack - (uninteresting) 
Sound Effects - (the usual) 
Enjoyment -/-- 
Art and Animation - (okay) 
Sound - (almost bad, but voice actors are good enough to enjoy it nonetheless) 
Story and Content -- (too many annoying episodes) 
Characters - (a different focus would have made it better) 
Value - (unlike season - I will hopefully forget about this one) 
Conclusion 
OreImo- is my disappointment of the year... It’s sad and it made me angry. Suddenly I focused too much on the bad aspects of the show and couldn’t enjoy myself like I used to in season -. 
While it ends not as terrible as it starts out, it still was just very bad overall.

Date A Live, a series that I never really took seriously to begin with. When it comes to harem based animes, they're either suppose to be funny, serious or romantic and Date A Live was none of that. There were no jokes to laugh at, the serious moments about Kotori and Origami's past were presented horribly and the romance was as good as a third grade stage play about Romeo and Juliet. I'll be honest, the only reason I actually decided to watch this series was because of Kurumi and Yoshino who have been added to my list of Favorite Psychopaths and Favorite Kawaii Characters. 
Date A Live attempts to be serious with the whole Spirits can destroy the world and everything but having to make them fall in love with them turns the situation into a horribly done comedy. After reading the synopsis, you may think this show has to either be funny or serious with comic relief but you're incredibly wrong. The only thing that actually stuck out in this series are the character designs and the weaponry used by the spirits. Date A Live has perfect cosplay material (for females anyway). The weaponry and powers of the spirits are each incredible but sadly their handlers are not. 
The characters are each pretty damn annoying except for Yushino who makes a great dandere and Kurumi who plays a great villain. Maybe that's just my bias but none of the characters are very memorable. The only time I found any enjoyment while watching this series was during the fight scenes. Everything else was pretty much needless and a boring wannabe romance.

--% of my review relates to the story and characters, so I'm going to skim through the rest of the categories first. 
Art -/- 
Average, nothing stands out and this ""magical"" world we see consists mostly of wooden towns and rocks. 
Sound -/- 
Serviceable, although forgettable enough that I don't actually remember if there *was* music. And a very weird detail they have is that the magic language of the world isn't so much a language, as just speeding up a bunch of sounds until the wizard sounds like a chipmunk. It looks and sounds stupid and I don't know whose fault it is. 
Enjoyment -/- 
Anecdote time! Slight spoiler warning, but it illustrates my point: Satou eventually meets another reincarnated person who talks about being born as a princess, ruling a kingdom, then being overthrown by treacherous royals and sold into slavery, where she survives by virtue of her psychic magic. The first thing I thought hearing that was ""Wow, I would give anything to be watching that story instead, right now"". 
Story -/- 
A lot of the arguments I've seen between critics and fans of this show are based around the defense that this is supposed to be a peaceful and cozy life in a fantasy world, not some action-packed RPG. Which is a perfectly fine pitch - I love slow road trip stories like Mushi-shi, and I've watched more purposefully cozy anime than I care to count. The problem here, being, -/- of Death March's episodes are devoted to Satou fighting monsters, demons, and evil wizards. It is barely the thing it claims to be! It takes -- episodes to leave the starting town, on this supposed journey. 
Now, I recognize that there is the angle of ""Satou doesn't want to be some great hero, but the war still finds him"". Nothing that happens seems to be related to an overarching story that I can identify, and even if it later turns out they are, all of it is so generic and uninspired that I'd rather rewatch a good show. 
I even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt - you know, maybe the novel was adapted poorly...but no, the pacing is just as bad. 
Characters -/- 
Alright, everybody has talked this point to death I'm sure, but...the slave girls. They're an anchor that drags this shit down. They have no personality. Oh sure, they individually have one or two character traits (mostly a shared trait called ""Loves Satou soooo much""), but there are so many of them that they just blend together into a homogeneous moe-blob. Usually, with a harem, you try to have a few personality types for variety, but with Death March, you only have two choices: an actual child, or block of wood. 
Satou is the real offender here though. He goes beyond/below being a self-insert isekai MC. He takes in all of these slaves under the pretense of ""I'll treat them well, so better they're with me than at risk of ending up with a bad person"", but he NEVER makes an attempt to free them or really treat them as equals. For Kami's sake, he gives the animal-girls literal pet names! 
I mean, if he was openly racist about it, that would at least be some sort of personality, but he has none. I remember a humorous point where he gets a skill called ""Poker Face"" when he's trying not to react to something, and all I could notice was that it was the exact same face he had been making up throughout the show so far. I think his expression changes a total of two or three times over the course of the entire show; mostly he just stares vacantly at a point slightly off-screen, which is probably what you'll be doing after watching this drudgery for any amount of time. 
Overall -/- 
On a technical level, Death March is serviceable. Heck, if you make an effort to avoid reading into things (and this is literally the first isekai you've ever watched), maybe you can enjoy it. At its core though, this is a lazily written harem show. The MC claims he loves and would never touch any of these girls, yet the show constantly goes out of its way to sexualize them (especially the underage ones). The show promises a magical world, but offers nothing imaginative beyond waving a D&D handbook in your face.  
Instead of slogging through -- episodes that MIGHT lead to something if this doubtfully gets a second season, your time would be better spent finding any other isekai. Even a bad one would have some value in the cringe factor; Death March doesn't even have the decency to be dumpster fire.

Making a game is never easy.  Especially due to the fact that the market for entertainment these days is so large, getting your name out there on a game and doing well is rather difficult.  So, what show tackles this wasteland of a market where only the strong will survive?!  KOUYA!  A show that will...ironically, end up into obscurity itself give it a couple of months... 
Story:  Buntarou is your average high school boy.  Well, not really average, but you get the idea.  He likes to help people with their problems, works hard to the pint that everyone knows him and has a good impression of him, and likes to write for the drama club to aid them in their productions.  However, on one faithful day, a beautiful but cold girl by the name of Kuroda asks Bunta on a date, assessing him before finally declaring him to be the writer of a new project of hers; making a galge.   
The main premise of Kouya is supposedly to 'make a visual novel game'.  I use the word supposedly because in all honesty, this show makes no effort to try and make that the central focus.  The general synopsis of any given episode starts with something going wrong with development and/or Kuroda having an issue with the people who are working and fulfilling her dream FOR FREE, the person she upsets and/or yells at subsequently leaves, Bunta and the rest of the cast spend most of the episode to try and get that person back, they reconcile, rinse and repeat.  And this is quite honestly the entire runtime of the show.  Throw in a few forced character developments, some forced story elements (like bullshit romance), and you have what is basically Kouya in a nutshell.   
The story itself is very stale because the entire series is based around internal conflicts within the group that sometimes make me wonder why these people even bother banding together in the first place, since many of them say ""I'm leaving and never coming back"", before coming back ready to work again, before leaving again.  It's repetitive and not really all that imaginative.  It also bears mention that because the show is stuck in this endless loop of arguments, anything else that the show tries to do end up either being very cliche, or are so underdeveloped that it doesn't even matter.  Have a problem with voice acting?  Well, with a few words of encouragement, she'll 'magically' do better.  Artist can't draw?  Well, console her and she'll 'magically' do better.  See the issue here?   
The attempt at comedy that the show does also doesn't do the show really any favors as well.  Most of the comedy bounces off of character retorts or over exaggerated moments that for the most part aren't really all that clever and/or imaginative.  Because the show feels so forced, they end up feeling more cringeworthy than anything and I honestly couldn't even laugh most of the time because of how they were presented.   
Overall, Kouya's story was full of forced character development, constant arguing, and some downright laughable attempts to make itself interesting.  While the show piqued my interest at first because it reminded me of a show with a similar concept called Saekano, there was in no way in hell that I would want to compare this piece of trash to that show.  Plus, the entire last episode is one big waste of time since they basically do nothing during its entire runtime. 
Overview: 
+ Interesting story concept 
- Terrible execution 
-  Entire runtime was a boring and sometimes irritating rinse and repeat setup 
-  Lots of cliches and unndeeded story elements to move the story along 
-  Ending episode was a complete waste of time 
Characters: Characters are also a big issue when it comes to the series as a whole due to the fact that really no one stands out as their own character. 
Rokushara, the small game company that's started by Kuroda, consists of our main protagonist Buntarou, his friends Atomu and Yuuka who hates normalfags and is energetic as all hell respectively, a fujoshi named Andou who CONSTANTLY fights with Kuroda, and Yuuki (Tori-chan) who despite her small and meek nature, aspires to be a hentai artist.  I grouped up the entire main cast of this series all up into one because quite honestly, that's all they really are.  Since all of the character development is forced and really doesn't add much to the characters at all, this is pretty much what we're left with.  All of them are just generic anime cliches that really don't have much substance to them as a whole.  Tropes aren't bad, and can be done tastefully, but in this case, Kouya focused way too hard on trying to create proper drama that it forgot to make its own characters interesting and made it even harder to root for them since they all have terrible personalities.   
Side characters are really nothing but plot devices in Kouya due to the fact that the show spends the majority of its time on its main characters.  Any character that isn't part of the Rokuhara group is really nothing more than someone used to fill up cast space.   
Overview: 
-  Generic, underdeveloped main character 
-  Plot device side characters 
Art:  The art for Kouya isn't anything special.  The animation is standard to what we see normally today in anime, and there's really nothing special in that regard.   
Sound:  Similar to art, the OST for Kouya really isn't anything to write home about.  The opening is a rock song that while yes, does have some aspect of memorabilia to it, it's...rather unfitting for the show despite its translation title being ""Girls from the Wasteland"", and the ED is rather bland and it's just this happy ditzy song that's completely skippable. 
Personal Enjoyment:  At first, I really thought that Kouya really had something going for it.  It was a show about making visual novels and given that a similar show called Saekano has basically the same premise, and did rather well, I thought that this would be a reflection of that, or would be similar in that regard.  But week after week all I got were the characters just arguing with each other, with only some snippets of progress.  Hell, they even stated themselves that they were on a tight schedule, and the fact that they were spending more screentime fighting and arguing than actually making the goddamn game.  Top it off with lackluster everything as we got closer and closer to the end, and we have ourselves an ironic failure. 
Did I enjoy this anime?   
No, no I didn't.  As the weeks progressed, I honestly started hating the show more and more because of how poor the writing and the progression actually was. 
What didn't I like about this anime?   
Personally, while I could say I just hate everything and be done with that, I want to get into specifics here.  Sayuki Kuroda is hands down one of the brutal and inhumane characters that I have ever seen in a school related anime.  She is the sole reason why everyone in this goddamn anime leaves.  She is a complete tyrant to the people who are trying to help her, and she put her writer on house arrest, prohibiting from allowing him to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, or spend any time on anything BUT writing just because they were behind schedule.  (This was an actual episode that happened.  It was the least funny thing I have ever seen in anime even though they played it off like a joke.)  Like actually, HOW in ANY WAY are we supposed to feel sorry or support a character who does all of this? 
Would I recommend this anime? 
Girls from the wasteland Kouya is an anime that should be left in the wasteland.  Any and all development from this show is forced and is only there to feign a sense of progress.  The show is revolved around constant bickering, spends only a small fraction of its time on any sort of actual game making, and to top it off, has one of the worst female leads that I have ever seen in a school related anime.  This is a show that deserves to be left out in the wasteland and be forgotten.

[Spoiler Warning] 
Let me just keep this short and sweet: 
The MC's stupidity, shallowness, short-sightedness, failure to understand the ramifications of what his actions are causing, coupled with his wimpy sounding voice actor (VA): Pisses. Me. Off. 
You might ask why am I sticking through this ordeal. Reason is simple: The books ended when the MC said to Lacia that he will not join her after learning she evolved to super-intelligent AI status. I'm simply curious on how the ending would turn out to be. 
The execution was a pile of hot mess as well. The cinematography, the art of the anime, the sound effects all felt cheap, generic, and overused. 
But it all boils down to this primary reason on why I'm rating this show a shiny score of ""-"": This pushover of a MC with his lack of critical thinking skills who enjoys being led around the nose by a pair of android tits, hands down the most pathetic anime MC I've ever witnessed. The studio also couldn't had done a better job of finding the most pathetic sounding VA to couple with this fool. 
Concept art was by Redjuice, which was awesome. Main reason why I checked this show out in the first place.

For a spoken review, click the link to the video review on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB-ZD-jHR_g 
It seems like, in the anime industry, the major problem people have with these School Comedy type shows is they are all the same. It just seems like the more of these shows are made, the more generic they get. Repeated scenarios, character archetypes, and so on. There are a number of things shows like these can do to separate themselves, but the question I pose today is what does Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, otherwise known as Haganai, do to make it worth your time to watch this show as opposed to any other shows of its genre? Let’s find out in the second review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February. So without further adeu, let’s continue ecchi month with my review of Haganai. 
Story: 
Every teenager has undergone the awkwardness of high school. Making new friends and trying to fit in. It's hard enough doing so under normal circumstances. Try doing so with blonde hair and a bad boy outward appearance in Japan. After transferring to a new school, Kodaka Hasegawa was instantaneously labelled a ""delinquent"" due to his eccentric appearance. Having classmates shiver in your presence is not a good way to start the school year. One day, Kodaka has a surprise encounter with a female classmate, Yozora, who just might be more of an outcast than him - she has both a bad temper and an imaginary friend. However, even outcasts desire companionship. The two decide to form the ""Neighbors' Club,"" specifically designed for people who don't have many friends. Kodaka, a lone wolf in the wild terrains of high school, had finally found his pack. But will this dysfunctional bunch be able to form normal relationships with each other? Or will their unique personalities collide? To answer my question from before, “What does Haganai do to give itself an original identity?” is very simple. Nothing. There really is no outliers in the story construction, the show sets up nothing new in its genre, and it really follows all the archetypes and scenarios shows of this caliber have set up. The story is a simple construction, with nothing new coming into play. A group of friends form a club revolved around making friends, somehow not realizing that, by making this club, they are all friends. Even once the whole gang is assembled, their goal is still to find friends, even though they all have their fellow club members. Not sure if that’s a fantastic use of irony or I should be tearing my hair out in frustration because they never come to that realization. Anyway, it’s a sad thing to say that this show offers nothing new. There are a number of things shows can do to make themselves stand out, such as in Saekano, Kato’s character took the show from good to great, but this show really doesn’t do anything of the sort. But that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it. As average as this show was, the scenarios that took place, and the antics of the characters were enough to put a smile on my face. As I said last week, shows like these cannot be judged in the same way as other shows and you have to have a different mindset when reviewing. But at the same time, as enjoyable as this show was, I could find this amount of enjoyment in almost any ecchi harem. Very little progression is made through the first season, and it really seemed like they started from square one at the end point of the show aside from adding new members. This show also thought it would be a good idea to add a conclusion at the end relating to the two main character’s backstory, alluring at it throughout the entire series with flashbacks and subtle hints. But, to me, this just seemed out of place. The show chose to go an ecchi harem comedy route throughout --% of its runtime, but then decided to take a turn towards a compelling backstory dealing with past friendships. With the comedic structure of the show, this seemed to me like a way to force the ending, and shove some character backstory in our faces just to show the main characters weren’t always friendless. This more serious moment really took away more than it added to me, feeling forced and out of place in a show that revolved almost entirely around comedic scenarios. So for the story of Haganai, it really doesn’t bring anything new to the table. An average setup, stereotypical scenarios, and nothing new to give this show its own identity. That’s not to say this show wasn’t enjoyable, because I did have a good time watching, but you could find almost the same amount of fun and enjoyment in --% of the anime in the same genres. Also, the ending felt forced with story devices that were predictable, out of place, and just plain not needed. Lastly, in terms of ecchi (because that’s what we’re all here for) the show was much lighter than I expected. There is very little nudity amongst characters who aren’t --, and the ecchi is mostly just a lot of fanservice, with swimsuits, boob jiggles and the like. To be honest, even in terms of ecchi, this show isn’t even that different. 
Characters: 
The characters for this show are incredibly weak, to say the least. The one thing I did like about these characters is that, despite them all being harem stereotypes, they were on the lesser seen side of archetypes. Like a Himidere, a perverted scientist, and a chuunibyou loli. But at the same time, these characters do not go beyond these archetypes, but we will get into that more as we go over each character. The first character, and the only male in the show, is Kodaka Hasegawa. Kodaka Hasegawa is the main protagonist of Haganai. He is the second member and co-founder of the Neighbors' club and was notorious for being a delinquent and bullying many of his peers. However, those claims are false and the reason why he has such a bad reputation is due to his hair; he is actually a very soft-spoken and polite individual. Aside from being exactly like the main character from Toradora, he really has no defining traits. Now, the fact that he is seen as a delinquent and is unable to make friends because of it is something that separates him from other harem protagonists, it’s about all he has. He has very little backstory, but the backstory he is given feels out of place given the style of the show, being used to force a conclusion to the show. The next character is Yozora Mikazuki.  Yozora Mikazuki is the female protagonist of Haganai. She is the founder, first member, and club president of the Neighbor's Club. Prideful and easily provoked by nature, Yozora detests ""normals"" but decided to make a club to make friends. The reason why Yozora doesn't have any friends is because she's a natural loner and dislikes ""normals"", preferring to have an ""air friend"", whom she calls ""Tomo-chan"". Yozora is a character I’m really not too fond of. Some of this is due to her personality, but a lot of it is the show’s portrayal of her. She starts of in a rivalry with Sena, butting heads very frequently. But as the show progressed, this rivalry became far more one-sided, resulting in Yozora coming across as a serious bully. This conflict would have been better if they kept it as a rivalry, but the fact that it shifted to a one-sided onslaught put a bad taste in my mouth mainly in regards to Yozora’s character. The character this bullying is focused on is best girl, Sena Kashiwazaki. Sena Kashiwazaki is the First member of the Good Neighbors club. Her wealth, beauty and outstanding academic and athletic performance has made her popular among male students, and likewise have made her an outcast among girls. Despite being constantly surrounded by boys (who, according to her, are ""doormats""), all she wants are true friends, which drives her to join the Neighbors' Club. Sena doesn't have any female friends because she is envied by other girls due to her good looks and popularity with the opposite sex. The only thing that I wished they would have changed about Sena is that she would be obsessed with Eroge as opposed to dating sims. It would have added a medium for more ecchi as well as giving her more to separate her character. Sena’s character is really only what you see at face value, but has enough to her personality to easily make her best girl. And by personality, I mean she has extremely large boobs. For the next characters, the sad thing about them is they have one defining trait that they are ruled by, and do not stray from this in any way. Maria Takayama is the supervising teacher and moderator of the Neighbor's Club somehow at the age of -- who’s character revolves around “Onii-chan’s” and poop jokes. And not the good kind of poop jokes, just repetition of the word ""poop."" Yukimura Kusunoki is a cross dressing maid (who’s gender is up for debate) that becomes Kodaka’s underling to try and become more manly. Rika Shiguma is a perverted scientist whose sole form of personality lies in her various sexual fantasies. And lastly is Kobato Hasegawa, Kodaka’s cosplaying sister. But she’s voiced my Kana Hanazawa and is absolutely adorable, so she’s fine just the way she is. The problem with all of these characters is that they are only what is seen at face value and their archetypes. They have no feelings, no emotions, and are left to just be shells of characters soley there for the sake of comedy. There is no insight into any of the characters of the show aside from Yozora and Sena, and the little that is given into them is so cliche and sparse that it's hard to separate Haganai from the thousands of other ecchi comedies. This makes the characters for Haganai one of its worst aspects. 
Art/Animation: 
Just like everything else in Haganai, the art and animation are completely average, but let’s be real, that’s not what you watch these shows for. And I guess it’s also par for the course. The art is really bland, with no real distinguishing things that give it any merit. The only thing that really made the show any different were the character designs, which I actually did enjoy. But, like I said, this really isn’t a type of anime that you watch for its artistic merit, so it never takes away from the enjoyment. 
Sound: 
As if I haven’t said this enough, the sound is yet another thing that really didn’t do anything for me by way of giving itself an original feel. While, yes, this is a show that doesn’t need an OST that emphasizes a certain atmosphere, a god soundtrack could have been what this show needed to stand out. But alas, there is nothing new here and nothing that really makes for a good standalone listen. The opening is quite catchy, however, and really fits the series well. The ending is good, and seeing that the voice actress for Yozora sings it is a nice touch, but even still isn’t enough to redeem the OST. The voice actors all played their roles very well, and did a good job at portraying each character's defining traits, which is good because that’s really all they have. And obviously the best voice actor of the show is Hanazawa Kana, who plays the Chuunibyou loli and Kodaka’s sister, Kobato Hasegawa. God, that woman can truly play any role. Can she just hurry up and marry me already? 
Overall: 
Haganai is a show that really suffers from the flaw of not doing anything to make itself stand out amongst anime of the genre, and for that reason I find it really hard to recommend you watch this show. I’m not going to go as far as to say you shouldn’t watch it because for an ecchi harem you really can’t go wrong with this one. For this show, it really just has to deal with your opinions on average. If you take everything you watch at face value and enjoy it no matter what, then I can see why you would like this show. While it doesn’t do anything different, it’s still an enjoyable show for those who like seeing antics of club attending high schoolers. But for those that want more, or for those who are tired of seeing the same ecchi harem setup and character archetypes, I can say with upmost certainty this show is not for you. The story is incredibly simple, with no interesting setups or dynamics that make is any different from other shows of its kind. the characters, while they are on the lesser used side, are all standard archetypes of ecchi harems, and are defined by their traits with no real emotions, and are just shells of characters used for the sake of comedy, aside from Sena, Yozora, and Kodaka. The art, animation, and sound do just enough to make the show work, but just like everything else, offer nothing new to be experienced. With the exception of Hanazawa Kana, of course. Even in terms of ecchi, there is nothing that stands out, mainly consisting of your standard beach bikini scene or lewd sexual fantasy. And, I believe this has to be said, but only one scene actually gave me a boner. Too much information? Sorry about that. In the end, I would say if you like these types of shows, go for it. You won’t be disappointed. And heck, even I had fun watching the antics of the characters. But if you’re looking for something new, or expect something that’s not ecchi harem stereotypes, you’ve come to the wrong place. As for alternate recommendations, I think you should check out My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu. SNAFU takes the concepts of Haganai and takes them to the next level by actually portraying the characters as humans through its dialogue. And you should also check out Absolute Duo for more ecchi harem goodness. Not really anything special here either, but if you liked Haganai, I’m sure you would like this too.

I know this anime is kinda infamous in the community, so I'm gonna try my best to explain how I saw this. 
Story: The plot seems pretty cool for the majority of the original light novel series (which is the original source material). There's an RPG online game called Sword Art Online. It's new. It's hot. And it uses a virtual reality helmet to control avatars with the players' minds. Seems pretty fun, right? Well, how about the creator trapping you in that said world until you can complete all --- levels of the game? Oh, and if you lose all your health, not only do you die there, you also die in the real world? The concept of being trapped in a game is nothing new, but when you have life or death on the line, that sounds like an anime to watch...I still have yet to read the original light novels, but when you get past the first arc of Sword Art, I almost forgot that was the case until halfway through the first season because of how fucking unsympathetic they are towards it. I guess it's considered my WTF towards the story, but without spoiling too much, let's just say that the second arc is a really a WTF moment. With that said, I would give this a -/--, and that may be just me being nice. 
Art: In my opinion, the art is pretty spot on as far as shonens go. However, there are times where whenever this is a battle scene the art doesn't do enough, which is quite a shame because this is called Sword Art Online, not a parody of a trapped inside of a video game anime. This is where you have to fight in order to survive, and I think it would've been a lot better if they did add some blood into the video games. However, that might be the original writer's choice, but at least make it look like it hurts! The scar marks on the characters are cool, but make the character reactions more realistic because this is a game where the player uses their mind to move and feel. So this would be rated -/-- for me. 
Sound: Even though I love the soundtrack to this anime, there are certain songs that annoyed me. First of all, why do people say that the first opening is catchy? Maybe it's my nitpick, but I don't like the artist who sings the first opening. Her voice is pretty nasally, and I can't stand it. The second opening though is so much better. It matches for what the arc was going for much better than the first one. I mean, the first one is not bad for matching I guess, but it just turns me off. When it comes to endings, the first ending is pretty top and matches the show when it comes to what circumstances Kirito is facing. The second ending is straight up boring. It kinda suffers the same problems that opening one faced, but what makes this more boring is that this is about Kirito's cousin. Why not make it about Asuna only? She's the only person that really matters to Kirito! I understand that Suguha becomes more important in the second half of this season, but I honestly can't stand the girl. She's just a distraction for what Kirito needs to accomplish. But song wise, it's just your generic ending that sounds more like a opening. Because of the one opening and one ending, the sound has to be downgraded to -/--. 
Character: There are a lot of characters that come out of this season, and unfortunately, we don't end up getting to know a lot of them personally except for a few. So character development...kinda sucks here. Of course, there's Kirito, our main character, and let's go over his one major flaw. The motherfucking plot armor. For those of you who don't know what that means (but if you're an anime fanatic, then you should know by now), plot armor is basically the trope of the main character cannot die for the sake of moving the plot along and he's basically the strongest character due to the fact he can't lose. This might not always be a bad thing, but because of Kirito's undeveloped personality, plot armor becomes more annoying by the second. One character I will compare to prove my case of how it can work is Natsu from Fairy Tail. At least with Natsu, we have a backstory that makes us sympathize and empathize with our main male lead, and because of how long the series is, we have the time to get to know this character besides his obvious tropes. We know almost nothing about Kirito until the second half of this season, but not even that's enough to actually like him. I find him sexy, but his deadpan personality throws me off. Asuna is the female lead that could've been the next ""Katniss Everdeen,"" but then she ends up being ""Bella Swan."" (Personally, I don't like Hunger Games either, but I digress.) We see her in the first few episodes with a bad ass personality and we thought she was gonna do something cool, but then she falls under the damsel in distress trope that pisses everyone off. She was downgraded to make Kirito ""look better,"" which does not work. Then, we have Klein. Personally, I love Klein. I wish there was more of him. He was funny, and he had the skills of leading a group in order to save everyone. We were introduced to him as the new guy in the first episode, but he progress so much. How come we don't get that in Kirito? That is so weird how the anime did that! Then, we have two characters that are basically pointless. Yui, who is...apparently Kirito and Asuna's pet now. Her only reason of existing is supposively to bring Kirito and Asuna together even more, but why? They were already ""in love"" by the time they met Yui. Then, of course, she's also the ""you need to learn how to believe in humanity again"" sort of person, but we should've established that in episodes before! Then, we get to the second arc and we meet...Leafa (aka Suguha's avatar). I hate this bitch. I cannot stand her. Her only purpose is to remind us that Kirito also has a harem. Why? She's his cousin! Why do we need this? All she basically is is a carbon copy of what Asuna was supposed to be. We don't need another Asuna! With that said, the score is pretty low in the character department of -/--. Extremely pathetic. 
Enjoyment: As you can see, the above factors do affect whether you might like this anime or not. I will be dead honest and say that despite these things, the enjoyment is a hit or miss because of backstories and moments that were either necessary to the anime or not. There are plenty of filler episodes in the first half, which are completely full of unnecessary characters, and whether you watch the dub or sub, it doesn't matter. The character interactions will straight up be unnatural even from a virtual reality RPG. You might have some emotional moments, and there will be times that your heart will pound, but it probably doesn't last that long. Score: -/-- 
Overall: Okay, I bitched and moaned enough. I'm just gonna go to the overall score, and that's a rounded -/--. So the infamous rumors might be true; however, I would recommend this anime to beginner watchers so you can see how anime was improved over time. If you are a veteran already, don't degrade yourself like I kinda did for this.

Black Lagoon is about a Japanese man who is tired of getting his ass kicked by his own boss at work, and he is kidnapped by a ""pirates"" (though in this case, a small group of badass people who do things just for money). The anime later shows what the Black Lagoon company does for a living such as stealing famous paintings or being involved in kidnappings.  
Let's begin with the story. 
Story: - - What I've said above is pretty much what the storyline of Black Lagoon is all about. There's not much of a ""story"" at all, just a lot of action-packed scenes, cursing, drinking, and most of all: smoking. There are short side-stories, but this anime is not about the story: it's about the action. 
Art: - - I don't watch anime because of what it looks like, but the art is very well done in this.  
Sound: -- - Best opening theme song ever. Well, in my opinion. It's very catchy (I put it on my iPod) and it fits the anime quite well. The ending theme is very mournful and doesn't seem to fit the anime at all.  
As for the voice acting, it's one of the best I've heard so far, both Japanese and English. But I would have to say, and it's very rare, that the English dub is a lot better than the Japanese. Not many anime have English voice actors that are superior to the Japanese dub, but in this anime, it is. There's no wincing when characters talk or yell or cry; it all sounds natural. 
Character: -- - I love EVERY character in this anime, even the antagonists! Sadly, though, the main character, Rock, is very wimpy and doesn't do any action at all besides this one (funny) part. If you're looking for an anime with a main character that does badass things, then this isn't for you. Even though Rock is a pussy, his character is likable and you can easily relate to him. He's the one who tries to talk things out as opposed to shooting a man in the face.  
Dutch is the captain of the Black Lagoon. He's only shown in a few episodes, along with his partner, Benny. Dutch is good with a gun (but not as good as Revy) and an awesome character. It's a pity his character isn't shown much as the anime progresses. 
Benny is the ""brains"" of the Black Lagoon. He prefers to stay out of violent situations and instead stay at his computer. 
And finally, probably the most liked character in the whole anime: Revy. 
Revy is a badass, short-tempered bitch. She does like all of the action in the anime, AND the cursing. You do NOT want to piss her off. Seriously. She's not nicknamed ""Two Hands"" for nothing: she's a pro when it comes to shooting. She is a little sadistic and bitter (okay, a LOT), but her smart remarks and short temper are what makes the anime enjoyable and fun to watch. 
There are other characters that are so worth mentioning, but I do not want to spoil anything.  
Enjoyment: -- - I watched both the first season and second in two days. I could've watched it non-stop, but had other things to do. This anime is so fun to watch because there's so much action in it. But if you're someone who is looking for an anime with a complex story, then you probably won't like Black Lagoon. 
Overall: - - I would say the lack of a storyline was the only thing that prevented me from giving this anime a --. It is an excellent anime, though.

Amazing.Absolutely amazing.A must watch for all martial arts fans but also for those who are not into martial arts(mostly if you are into character development).This anime got me into martial arts(shotokan karate) and I bet it will get other people into martial arts as well.Just finished the manga (-/--/---- exactly two years after the manga originally ended)and it was mind blowing.I highly suggest that after watching the anime  you read the manga.You can watch the OVA's too.I am astonished I never thought it would impact me in such a way.The story was very well done the characters are very loveable and original,especially Kenichi.His journey from zero to hero was beautiful.I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.I highly suggest you watch it.And by the way tell more people about this series I think that it deserves more popularity than it has.It was truly beautiful and life chancing.A masterpiece.

Art: Where to begin with how much the art sucks? The fact that a movie released in ---- somehow has worse -D graphics than a computer game released a decade early? The fact that the same fucking ""nameless soldier"" model is used for hundreds of soldiers in every fucking scene regardless of whether if it's action or not? The fact that the models are ugly and plain as fuck even when used for close-ups and still shots? The fact that the faces are completely flat and not even shaded --% of the time? Everything in the movie is undetailed, from the weapons, to the faces, to the armor, to the clothing - it's like everything was made out of Lego. The main point is that -DCG is shit. You don't get the motion blur that you get with -D hand drawn, meaning the action looks choppy as fuck. Where we would normally see the sword swing being blurred, in the movie it's presented as - discrete frames of the sword being in - different positions in air. It does not provide any illusion of movement. In the original ---- series there was motion blurring of the sword noticeably in the assassination escape scene. In the movie (I watched the scene frame by frame about -- times so I know exactly what I am talking about) there was exactly one frame that had a tiny fraction of the tip of the sword blurred. You can't even notice it. In the ---- anime this scene was so well animated it was easily OVA quality. You could easily see the exact path of the sword with clarity even though it was played out in real time. The camera angle of the ---- anime portrayed it perfectly, showing us exactly what happened. It was one of the few well animated bits of the series. In the movie we got a view from behind the two guards in front of Guts, so we got to see as little as possible of the actual action. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not but it's little things like these that add up to make me think the director had really no fucking clue what he was doing. Corkus' helmet design seems specifically to avoid having to animate his mouth because he talks a lot. When he said ""this bastard's the real deal"", he's is supposed to look surprised - he didn't. The soulless CG models made it impossible to show any emotions. This is the same as when the two soldiers saw Guts killing Adonis - they were supposed to be outraged but the soulless -DCG face just looked dumb. Adonis' death scene in the original ---- series was - billion times more emotional than the death scene in the movie, and I am not exaggerating. Those of you who think I'm exaggerating - go watch the original series right now. Episode --, --:--. The detail on the artwork is, as mentioned before, far, far superior to the artwork on the new Berserk movie, the animation in that particular scene also happened to be one of the best in the series. The raw emotion in that particular scene (again, not saying the ---- series was good, in fact it sucked, just that it had some good moments) is just incomparable to the soulless movie adaptation. You could actually feel the pain Adonis experienced, the guilt Guts felt, the guards' anger. It was all there. The movie adaptation was absolutely shite in this regard.  
Animation: The animation was on the whole, somewhat fluid. However, the -D movements looked wrong despite supposedly using motion-capture technology. I find it difficult to believe that people behave in such a jerky fashion during motion capture. Their limbs were constantly wobbling around and their heads constantly nodding about. Also during the fight scenes it looked like many of the soldiers were just waving their weapons around, not like they were actually fighting at all. If you can't be bothered to animate it properly because they weren't main characters, don't animate it at all because it looks fucking dumb. I can also go into how the depiction of the fights were not well done at all, not even compared to the ---- series which was a low-budget barely animated piece of shit. The original anime showed the axe cracking when it hits the helmet from the top in slow motion, making it very clear that axe cracked upon hitting the helmet, whilst the same scene in the movie was shot from behind the helmet and few frames were used thereby making it very difficult to discern what exactly happened. The fact that the original anime, which was a low-budget barely-animated piece of shit, is still better than this movie, shows just how much this movie sucks ass. It's worse than shit.  
Choreography: The choreography was a mixed bag. Let's start with the Bazuso scene. The movements of the guy who hired Guts for - silver coins' movements were completely bizarre and didn't look human at all. Bazuso's movements also looked completely ridiculous. There was too much unnecessary movement, Bazuso was bending his legs moving up and down, nodding his head back and forth for no reason apparently other than to show that this movie is, in fact, not very well choreographed. Guts' movement as he walked up to Bazuso was also fucked up, as in he looked like he was just shuffling and not really walking. His sword's movement also looked strange because the inertia was not portrayed well at all. A heavy sword like Guts' should have a ton of inertia and so cannot change direction like a plastic toy sword. When he swings the sword and abruptly stops it without slowing it down, that ruins the realism completely. 
I don't think I explained why the Guts vs Bazuso fight was so badly choreographed. Okay, let's do it. Firstly there is the issue that Guts was only bashing his sword against Bazuso's axe handle for --% of the fight. Why is this bad? Imagine someone is doing a downward vertical slash at you. That Bazuso, who is supposed to have slain -- men, does not know how to parry but only how to block, I find incredibly unrealistic and insulting. I also find it highly idiotic that Guts would do the exact same attack -- or -- times in a row, attacking the same place with the same swing every time. His actions resemble a blacksmith hammering a sword rather than that of a skilled swordsman.  
--------====Lengthy exposition on the physical and mechanical properties of Guts' sword and of plate armor begins====-------- 
Let's also leave aside the fact that Bazuso's axe must have been made of glass to shatter so easily, and that Guts bones must have been made of steel to withstand the enormous forces from accelerating what can only be called a slab of iron on a stick which must have weighed a ton.  
Don't believe me? Let's do the calculations on the mass of Guts' ""sword"". Assumptions: 
Density: - grams per cubic centimeter (steel).  
Length: ------- centimeters (the blade goes up to Guts' chest level) 
Thickness: - centimeters at thickest -/- of the blade, which means an average thickness of - centimeter for the other -/- of the blade, so the average thickness is -*-/- + -*-/- = -/- centimeters. (the blade is about -/- the thickness of Guts' arm at the elbow which we'll assume to be --cm) 
Width: ----- centimeters (the blade is as wide as the length of Guts' hand with fingers folded in) 
Minimum mass = - * --- * (-/-) * -- = ----- grams = --.-- kg 
Maximum mass = - * --- * (-/-) * -- = ----- grams = -- kg 
Swinging a sword that weighs between -- to -- kilograms is no mean feat. For comparison a heavy duty sledgehammer only weighs ---- kg. The main reason the sword is so heavy is because of the thickness. Quote from wikipedia: ""Frisian hero Pier Gerlofs Donia is reputed to have wielded a Zweihänder with such skill, strength and efficiency that he managed to behead multiple people with it in a single blow. The Zweihänder ascribed to him is, as of ----, on display in the Frisian museum. It has a length of --- cm (-- in) and a weight of about -.- kg"". So in fact Guts sword is remarkable not for its length but for its thickness. Anyone who thinks --kg is easy to handle should try swinging around a --kg olympic bar. It's impossible to swing around an object like that with any degree of control. ""B-b-but muh deadlifts!"" you exclaim. Lrn- leverage retard. It's easy to pick up a steel bar when you're holding two ends of it between your hands so that there is no turning moment and the center of mass is directly touching your line of gravity. You might find that medieval two-handed swords weighed a maximum of -kg and on average weighed -.-kg. There is a good reason for this - the center of gravity of a sword like Guts would have been -- inches from the hilt and would have felt like wielding - sledgehammers on each hand.  
Let's also not forget that medieval plate armor was designed to be impossible to cut with a sword and that people usually wore chainmail underneath plate armor which a sword also would not have been able to go through. In fact Miura showed that he understood this fact himself in Berserk chapter --- by having Gambino mention that the armor worn by aristocrats was ""impossible to penetrate"" and the only way to defeat it is to force the enemy down. This is not technically true. A rigid sword can penetrate plate armor if used to stab rather than cut. Here's a relevant quote from wikipedia: ""As armour improved, so did the methods of attacking the armour. It was quickly realized that cutting weapons were losing their effectiveness, so crushing weapons such as maces and axes were utilized. But thrusting weapons that could split the rings of mail, or find the joints and crevices of plate armour, were also employed. Long tapered swords could also be used as a lance once the lance was splintered. Thus was the estoc developed. The French word estoc translates to thrust."" Simply put, a sword being used to cut does not have the sectional density as the same sword used to stab. Relevant quotes: ""For illustration, a needle can penetrate a target medium with less force than a coin of the same mass. Similarly edge geometry comes into play- a steep angle at the cutting edge means that the sword has to displace material faster which 'bleeds off' energy more quickly as well- so a sword with 'bad' edge geometry will cut less well than a sword with 'good' edge geometry even if all other factors are equal."" The problem with Guts' sword is that the edge angle is too steep to cut effectively. The point of having a sword is to cut, making a sword really thick and heavy defeats the point. 
-----------====End of exposition====--------- 
But I digress. Let's move on to the next scene. Guts is fighting the man on horseback. The man on horseback attacks Guts. Guts deflects the sword and cuts the man by bring the sword over his head and then swinging from right to left. The action is hard to follow because it's too fast. The sword is depicted as bending severely under due to having to change direction from downwards to horizontal. Guts both stops the sword from swinging downwards and starts the sword swinging from right to left in what is essentially one frame of animation. That makes the action difficult to follow. But to say that it's badly choreographed would be stretching it. The idea of deflecting the horseman's sword is a good one, even if poorly executed. The main problem is that by the time Guts has deflected the horseman's sword, the horseman would have already passed Guts. The director apparently does not understand momentum. In the next scene the horseman with the spear throws it instead of stabs Guts with it for some reason. Guts moves to the side to block it and cuts the maceman's arm off. The arm should have continued to move forward due to momentum but it somehow stops in midair.  
It's concerns like these that spoil the realism. These should not even be concerns in a realistic series like Golden Age Berserk which was based, on the whole, in the medieval era. Physics should be the same. A horseman's arm should continue moving forward after being cut off. This is a fact of physics. Again, not saying the choreography is all bad. It's much better than the choreography in the ---- series, which was composed almost entirely of stills.  
Probably the choreographic highlight of the movie was the fight after the assassination scene. Surrounded by soldiers, movie Guts always happened to be fighting them one at a time when the soldier behind Guts could have easily attacked Guts whilst Guts was fighting another soldier. You could actually see in the movie that one of the soldiers had raised his sword and was about to strike Guts when Guts was fighting another soldier, then somehow the soldier who raised his sword put it down to wait for Guts to kill another soldier before finally making up his mind to attack Guts. In the ---- series, the anime avoided this problem by having Guts running from one side and the soldiers on the other side so that Guts avoided having to fight with enemies both in front and behind of him. Again, a small difference but it's the little things which add up. Also, when Guts jumped off the bridge, arrows were coming down from above his head at an angle which suggested that people from ANOTHER tower was firing at him from behind him, when the only crossbowmen shown thus far were on the same bridge as he was and therefore could not have possible fired from that angle. Again, extremely unrealistic and not present in the ---- anime.  
Conclusion: For a manga known by its great artwork, this anime adaptation was an extreme letdown. As I mentioned the -DCG was undetailed as fuck and absolutely not movie quality, not even TV or video game quality. Because of the terrible art the was action unclear and difficult to follow. The soulless -DCG created dumb flat-faced characters who looked retards and were incapable of expressing emotion. The choreography was probably better than the ---- series but ruined by the inexpressive featureless art, by unnecessary movements, random wobbling, excessive nodding and spastic movements, and just plain bad directing in the form of poor choice of camera angles.

I've watched the movie instanly after finish Ano Hana series... And it was a huge mistake. 
This movie show us a different point of view, because all characters at least have a moment when their own thoughts are showed. I guess that's the movie's point, the narrator is not only Jintan, all other main characters have something new to give us to understand a bit more the whole series. 
And... This give us a kind of decent ending to the series. 
But... I wouldn't recommend to watch this movie instantly after finished the series. 
The art is gorgeus, like in the series, main characters are a bit more developed. But I expepected more story development, because summary said it was one year after the end of series... If you like to watch the same story, but with a different point of view, this is your movie. If you expect something new... is not.

If you're reading this review, I'll assume you've seen Date A Live so I don't need to go into the details. I'll just write a simple review of this OVA 
Story -/--: 
Let's face it, we all love Kurumi Tokisaki, I mean, who doesn't. And this OVA gives the fans what they want. Kurumi on a date with Shido. Shido meets up with Kurumi at the Tanabata Festival and they go on a date which ends with them taking a wedding photograph together. A little plot twist at the ending is for you to see. 
Art -/--: 
Not as good as Date A Live - but still not bad. It was fairly good and pleasant to watch. 
Sound -/--: 
The opening and ending of the Date A Live II are used. 
Character -/--: 
We mostly see Kurumi and Shido in this OVA but a few minutes are also given to Tohka, Kotori and Yoshino. These are the characters shown in this OVA. 
Enjoyment --/--: 
I'm a big fan of Kurumi and I enjoyed this OVA from start to end. It's a really good watch. 
Overall, this was a really good OVA. Do watch it. Kurumi fans will especially love it.

This series is absolutely amazing. Deep, nuanced characters, subversive social critique, and a uniquely beautiful art style combine together to make possibly the most boring thing I have ever watched. There's no humor. There's no action. There's no drama. It defies all genre classification because it doesn't HAVE one. 
Despite all this, though, the series has yet to be truly BAD. There are no glaringly obnoxious characters, no plot holes, no rushed sequences of animation, no ridiculous assertions of the director's opinions. No needle that broke the camel's back. I simply continue to watch because I feel no reason not to. 
What makes this series amazing is exactly that. I don't think I have ever felt so NEUTRAL about anything in my life. If the director's intent was to create the single most uninteresting thing in all of history, he nailed it. The very definition of -/--.

Kodocha was the first anime ive watched, I watched it because it was in the public library. I was so sad it ended on a cliffhanger, but when i found the manga, i was more than happy. The anime catches the funny moments really well, maybe even better than in the Manga. I think near the end, the anime drifted from the original plot, so maybe thats why it ended. The art style isn't amAzing, but its neat since it was made in the --s. Im really glad i watched and finished, this anime first.  ANYWAYS, its incredible, made me cry, highly reccommend.

Looking at the synopsis, it is difficult not to inwardly groan at the premise that has been frankly done to death (and then some). So how does this ""cliché"" anime still manage to feel moderately fresh? In addition to a strong main cast and interesting dialogue, I believe the long and short of it is that Oregairu does not attempt to be anything more than it is. It rids itself of some of the annoying elements that other such shows tend to shoehorn in. That said, it is still by no means overly spectacular; it is merely a solid anime that depending on your tastes may very well be worth checking out. 
After the initial premise, Oregairu is a typical school comedy that as of yet does nothing to try and weave a narrative. This is unsurprising and generally expected of slice of life type anime, though in this particular case it kind of works to Oregairu's benefit. It allows focus to be drawn to character interactions without the distraction of a potentially haphazard plot. The show also lacks much in the way of drama, which is objectively neither a strength nor a fault; it honestly depends on your personal preferences. Personally, I tend to enjoy (well-crafted) melodrama in such slice of life shows, but interestingly did not miss it at all with this particular anime. 
The soundtrack here is unobtrusive yet not terribly remarkable. It gets the job done and you barely notice it, which can actually be a positive. The OP and ED in my opinion are mediocre: listenable but half of me feels like skipping them. Concerning sound design, I really do not have any complaints. In my estimation, the voice acting is the strongest point of this category. Every main character brings a fitting aura to their particular character, and combined with the fast-moving script it is certainly a job well done. 
The characters are where Oregairu really shines. You have Hikigaya Hachiman as the ironically apathetic and pessimistic loner of a main character, the silent and independent heroine portrayed by Yukinoshita Yukino, along with the ever cheerful and buoyant Yuigahama Yui as the second heroine. Although each of these character archetypes are easily recognizable, they all somehow feel fresh and charming as new, independent characters. This is mostly in thanks to the enjoyable fast-paced dialogue that the show offers. 
The aforementioned dialogue script is honestly the biggest strength of the anime in my opinion. It makes character interactions fun and engaging to witness and can usually bring a smile to your face. While nowhere near the wittiness of a show like Spice & Wolf, the script is a rank above a lot of the norm. The occasional dipping into analysis on societal norms with added focus to the loner syndrome is also a nice touch and easily relatable. Jokes are amusing and refreshingly downplayed; they are not overly obnoxious like many in anime are oft to be. That said, the series lacks much in the way of ""burst-out-laughing-while-holding-your-sides"" type moments, but that can certainly be forgiven. 
In summation, Oregairu is a surprisingly fresh and mildly enjoyable school comedy with strong characters and a good script. I recommend giving it at least a try, especially if you have a liking for toned down slice of life type series.

when it comes to slice of life anime you have to consider - things :  
-- how good the characters are. 
-- how real is their interactions. 
-- how entertaining the show is despite the first - things. 
now this show was bad in all -, first the characters were horrible. out of all the cast there were only - good characters: the guy with the computer (he was ok I guess), the teacher/dorm master and the mc's female friend. 
Other than those - the rest were very bad, for example:  
Misaki, if I had to state - reason out of the many many reasons this girl is in my top - most hated characters other than her having absolutely no pride is the fact that she was this, she found out the boy that she likes only used her sister as a way to release his sexual desire just to keep his relationship clean with misaki and also refused to go back to the sister when she asked him later, so when misaki heard all that she was happy because that means she had a chance. That has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen in an anime and people defend this saying ""Yes, he changed for her"", smh. 
Moving on to the mc who was pretty much a very annoying and selfish person, he didn't want happiness for anyone if he doesn't get it himself. 
His friend the guy that misaki likes also has some stupid logic that he uses just to keep going out with girls other than misaki to keep everything ""clean"". 
The rest were badly written but not as bad as those stated above like the foreigner girl that was in bed with all the characters for some unknown reason and kept annoying one of the few good characters in the anime till magic happened and now they love each other, she was badly written and all but not like the other - above. 
The -nd part is the interactions: were they good, did they feel real or anything like that?  
Nope, it looked like the author was trying to create a ""deep"" plot but it really never reached that point , it felt fake like he was trying to push anything into the story to reach the end which a lot of people fell for and now it is one of the most popular in the series but to be honest the only thing that I felt was pretty normal and actually thought about before writing was the job interview part because it was very nice to watch and was actually reasonable. 
The last part i want to talk about is the entertainment, now did i enjoy this anime?  
The answer is yes but only the first --- episodes, the anime was being introduced and i wasn't used to the characters and how good they actually were but after that, No i didn't enjoy it at all.  
To conclude: the anime was horrendous and i don't recommend it to anyone .

Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the ""genre stereotypes"" and then judging the anime around that? Just want to know if you should watch it? I've got you covered 
So I really enjoyed this anime for the most part. Good cast of characters, good animation, good typical plot line in an interesting setting (socially awkward genius girl tries to understand love in a forced pair up with an inexperienced ""lost direction"" boy). My problem was the lack of resolution for the MC's.  
The entire show was fun to watch. The middle of the season had some side plot that a lot of people didn't like, mostly because it puts the ""romance"" stuff mostly on hold, but I loved the amount of time the side characters and their romances got. Even the really brief stuff they did with a few of them gave just enough for you to care.  
The male MC is kind of infuriating at times, with his revealing inner monologue about his true feelings that he then does the opposite of, but the show moves along at a good pace. The story is fun, and there isn't too much stagnation.  
The end of the show is very cute and heart warming, but there is almost a dead stop for the MC's relationship. Even though the show seems to be trying to progress it still, annoying things (like a train going by and the sound drowning out the MC) prevent progress, and the show ends on a very mellow, anti-climactic note. 
Ironically some of the side characters and their romances get MORE and BETTER closure than the MC. 
It's still a good show though and I'm glad I watched it. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Good example of a typical romance anime plot, fun side characters and stories, good animation 
DISAPPOINTMENTS: Pacing in the middle of the season due to a side story that puts romance on hold for the MC's, annoying lack of progress and forced situational non-progress toward the end of the anime with regards to the MC's relationship.

I don't usually say negative stuff about the series that i watch, but I must say a few things about --if. 
I sound pretty mean and maybe i just didn't get the point and the plot, but this is what i have to say 
In the whole series I was confused as f*ck... 
- Episodes , and nothing important is explained so far. It's like watching spongebob with drugs and blood and don't make sense at all... 
And someone take the f*cking license of these drivers, they are all blind. 
Story:- 
It has some originallity but there are so many unexplained things that you get confused and lost. It's really slow and some episodes are boring. Also every episode has a different plot and don't follow the previous one...  
Characters:- 
There are only - characters that exist in every episode and they are all boring 
The main character finds everything normal and doesn't care at all. The girl isn't explained(I don't know if they will say what's the matter with her in the last episode, but so far they don't say anything).The cat is the best character from these - but he is still kinda boring. 
Art:- 
Now the art is actually original and interesting. It's just not my style, i find every character ugly.. 
The op is pretty good though 
Sound:- 
This is the best thing about this series. Nice op, different ending everytime, and nice soundtrack overall. Only the Voice acting was a bit out of place some times 
Enjoyment:- 
The best thing for me was the op, then i would get bored. 
Overall:- 
You can't make a good series with only good soundtracks and art styles... In the whole series i was bored and confused... I wouldn't recommend it but maybe i just didn't get it

Eve no Jikan tells the heartwarming story of segregation in a futuristic society and how a boy named Rikuo experiences both sides of the issue. It is reflective of our modern world as well as cultures from centuries before. I believe this short series would be one of my favorites if I wasn’t so perturbed by a detail that was never resolved. I can only describe it as a significant plot hole left behind by careless writing, and it distracted me for the entirety of my viewing. I will spoil a little of this anime, but let me explain; Rikuo’s connection to the android world is through his maid robot, whom he assumed had no sentience. Once he learned of her escapades, they develop a special understanding of each other. This bond combined with Rikuo’s obvious attraction to her should indicate a romantic undertone, right? Actually, their relationship never sprouts out of the ground. I know for a fact that the maid robot has sex functionality since she pretty much mirrors a female in every way. It wouldn’t be a realistic future if you couldn’t bang your life-like Roombas. So why didn’t they go the obvious route and contrive a taboo romance between Rikuo and the android? Although this complaint seems like a nitpick, it is exceedingly frustrating to watch such a low-hanging fruit never be harvested. It is apparent that the writers intended Eve no Jukan to be a love story, so I’m not sure why they scrapped it at the last second. Regardless, this is an enjoyable watch. The protagonist and his robot slave may not have hot metallic sex, but they stand alone as solid characters. They live in a city where robots, although possessing many human traits, are treated as objects and abused (though not sexually for some reason). It is fascinating to see the different perspectives in their society and how Rikuo learns to accept the right thing.  
Would have rated it -/-- if they kissed and -/-- if they smashed, but Rikuo and his virgin sexbot get a -/--. This ONA made me think deeply about its qualities and I hope I could provide an in-depth review to express that much.

This is one of the most shallow, frivolous anime I have ever watched. It has exactly two good points: Art and cutesy moments (which is at least --% art, the rest voice acting and atmosphere). But outside of that there is nothing I can even find remotely redeemable about this anime.  
A quick list of some of the very obvious problems with this anime:  
- SHALLOW characters: Yamada is literally just the insecure, innocent, shy girl. That's everything about her character. She loves Kase, because she is nice? She gardens because why not give her a random hobby. The friend, while being my favorite character, is still basically just the stereotypical spunky friend, with glasses because why not. Kase doesn't even have a personality, she just runs fast, is popular, and loves Yamada because why not. The only personality traits she exhibits is that she is ""nice"" and she is dense as a brick when it comes to their relationship (although that is obviously just plot reasons).  
- SHALLOW, STUPID, PREDICTABLE story: Shy girl loves the popular girl. Jealous of the attention she gets. Acts shy. Other girl has a misunderstanding, think she doesn't love her. Makeup. Rinse and repeat. Then towards graduation end it with ""I'll follow you to Tokyo"". Literally the whole story.  
- REDUNDANT, OBVIOUS Exposition: She repeats herself multiple times in monologue saying when she started dating Kase & that she loves her. Why? Just show the damn story.  
- CONTRIVED Plot & Conflict: Misunderstandings only absolute idiots would have just to further the conflict. Also, they come to the point of tears before communicating at all. Just ask her if something is wrong, stupid. Also, dumb random things. You could clearly see the view of the clouds out of any of the windows, but she was like ""You have to see this."" Dumb af. Apparently texting somebody in the middle of the night, and them not responding, should be enough to cause drama. Also, the way they make the ending sound was so stupidly predictable.  
- LOOSE ENDS & NO CHAR DEV: The little bit of drama, conflict, and character development that might have been dealt with was just left hanging. Yamada never really faced her briefly explored issues of jealousy and trust (proving the relationship was shallow at best). She basically went to Tokyo because she thought Kase would move on, not because she actually was just going to miss her. It was clearly a selfish motivation (or else she would have said something along the lines of ""I don't want Kase to feel lonely"" which she didn't). She also never addressed her naivety and innocence (Made painfully clear when she didn't know what ""do it"" meant). They just never brought it up again and she stayed the same sheltered child. Kase never got to truly explore a deeper relationship with Yamada even.  
-ENDED RIGHT WHEN THE STORY GOT INTERESTING: The normally innocent shy girl made the rash decision of following her love to Tokyo, and has to deal with acclimating and actually getting into a college there. Kase, who spent the whole OVA trying to deepen their relationship, finally got the step forward she wanted, and their relationship could finally step beyond the shallow bits of high school puppy love. That should have been the rising action, the real start of the story, not the conclusion.  
So yeah, it was trash everywhere except the art and VA.  
EDIT: I responded to a comment about this review and it made me think of a good point. My review of Asagao to Kase-san may be a bit heavy-handed, but part of that has been because of how well received it was. If I am watching fan service nonsense, I am expecting a shallow experience with no substance. Kase-san's reviews betray it, making the experience similar to diving head first in a shallow pool. It makes it shallowness that much more unbearable and revolting.

I think 'abstract' is the best way to describe this so called 'movie'. 
If you read the synopsis and look at the picture - what you see is literally what you get. 
To refine it into further detail: legs are dawdling about on the screen - setting up many ways to... wear the shoes, walk on the shoes and dance on the shoes. To add more excitement - an accordion is playing in the background in harmonious synchrony while the legs are doing its business with the shoes. Yeah... 
So suffice to say, this 'movie' is... a time waster... that's the honest truth... Even as a skit on youtube it'll be something that you'll watch for the first -- seconds before disregarding it as another shit video. 
If you have a foot fetish... you might like it? I don't want to guarantee anything since it'll probably be a massive let down with its close to zero animation detail - you might as well watch grass grow (seriously). 
It's art... and it was in the anime section so I watched it - only to realise I wasted - minutes of my life... 'Mars of Destruction' is 'The Godfather' compared to this.... 
So yeah... for the love of God, 'try' not to waste your time like I did. And if you do go watch it... Shame on you...

This anime begins being very interesting, as the protagonist seems to be a pervert with little shame. But this soon leaves place to other matters, with the series involving some all-mighty cat statues which grant wishes. One would think that with anything having the chance to become possible, things will become serious at any moment. Well, they don't. The series mostly involves a lot of monotonous slice of life. 
Characters seem very weak. One extremely big error is to deprive the feminine protagonist of her emotions at the first episode. This is not cute at all, it's as depriving Goku of becoming a super saiyan. One way to be cute is to show emotions. 
Also, with the protagonist being called ""The pervert prince"", one would expect a pervert, not a guy who wanders into an occupied bathroom by chance. I'm not impressed at all by his pervertness. 
There's also some filler episodes, even given the short episode spam, which do not add a lot the series (the extra imouto episodes). 
You will find some kind of story on the last two episodes, though. Things get a little emotional and briefly interesting, and then the anime ends as it could have ended on the second episode. 
One terrible thing is that music is almost non-existant. I think there was a good track and lots of silence. 
Good: the first episode and the last two ones. 
Bad: shallow caracters, with one of them even facially handicapped.

I'm having to write a new review as I couldn't edit my old one written mid series. 
So this series betrayed the faith I placed in it, I initially felt it wasn't that bad and it had promise, so I gave it a fair review and score, however when it ended and the dust settled the end result can only be that this is a dreadful adaptation. 
Nothing is earned, no time is devoted to the telling of the story, the progression of the story, nor the build up to the big moments. 
It's like if you took the LOTR films, cut out the journey and most of the rest of the content, and just had a -hr supercut of what you thought were the highlights, sure it would look impressive, but it would be a jumbled nonsensical mess that would leave you feeling dead inside. 
That is Knight's & Magic 
The main problem is when it's good, it's good, it's not amazing, but it shows promise, it could have dropped the whole isekai element to it and worked without it, maybe even been better for it, but that is an issue with the source material. 
But where it comes good is the design and development stages of the story, when the MC seeks to expand his knowledge in the construction of mechs and we get those moments, including the testing phase. 
The issue is with the adaptation itself, which is dreadful, the anime decided that we didn't want to spend too much time on that, so the best moments aren't as long as you might want them to be. They also get lost in the all the cuts from moment to moment and place to place all bound together with constant narration. 
The anime also wanted to rush the story, because it couldn't wait to get to what it felt was the good parts and to wrap up those storylines too. 
So, huge chunks of the story, huge portions of the LN ended up on the chopping floor, character development is cast aside giving us paperthin characters who you don't really care about. 
It doesn't take its time to tell the story, instead what you get it constant annoying narration and time skips, which breaks the cardinal rule of storytelling, show don't tell. The audience has to experience these things for it to have any meaning or impact, if they are just given a few lines of lazy narration instead then it not only disconnects you from the story and the moment, but removes any chance of investment that you might have been able to get otherwise. 
It's an absolute hack job of the source material, which from a small amount of reading didn't seem that bad, as I was willing to pin it down to bad writing, but it does look like it's all down to the studio and a terrible adaptation. 
It's a shame that this anime is so bad, I had hoped for a decent fantasy mecha anime, but this doesn't measure up. 
It's one of the biggest disappointments of that year

Well, this is the first review I am writing on this site and, about a two-episode hentai. Damn that's low. 
You see, there was once upon a time this perfect, amazing person (hint, me) that liked a visual novel. Long short story, in order to cut all my ties to the novel I watched this awful waste of time and...yeah, awful waste of time is the perfect description for Kara no Shoujo, the animated version. 
The plot? Not really elaborated. About our (possibly gigolo) detective trying to investigate serial killings, while other elements are introduced, which only makes it confusing. Jumping from plot to sex at apparently random times doesn't help. At all. 
Liked the art from the game? Well, fuck you, you get none of it. Instead have some cookie cutter, poor man's version of it. 
Sound? Some songs of the games are used, which is good. But the songs are not used enough, and more often than not don't use the right tracks at the right time. Call it nitpicking, but that's how I felt. 
The characters? Not developed. At all. Which is a shame. The only reason I am rating it five is because of Kuchiki Toko. 
Enjoyement? Zero. If you are watching it for the sex, guess what, cookie cutter hentai with low productions value, so not even that can be enjoyed, unless your standards are lower than the ground. 
Overall? Three. The sound and Toko are the only contents I can enjoy from this clusterfuck. Not as bad as Mars of Destruction or Chargeman Ken, but still bad. Really bad.

I think it was a few year ago that the name Gunbuster was introduced to me. Gurren Lagann had just ended and after finding myself dissatisfied with its ending, I asked some friends for some similar series. One of them mentioned Diebuster, another said that I shouldn't watch it until I had watched Gunbuster. Alas, I never actually bothered to watch any of the other super robot shows they named other than G Gundam. It was at a convention that I was again reminded of this amazing - episode OVA that I had neglected to watch. A friend of mine was cosplaying Noriko and after asking her about her costume, the discussion turned to Gunbuster, then to her excitedly telling me to go see it. So I did. 
Immediately, the Gainax ""touch"" struck me. Many of the established Gainax tropes were here, everything from boob-bouncing, the heavy fanservice and deep character development. What seemed to be missing was a well-developed plot. Aliens want to kill us, we build robots and ships to fight them. Almost the entirety of the plot can be summarized in that sentence. Case in point, Noriko, our protagonist, lost her father to the aliens but this is never a major plot point and only serves as a springboard for more of her character development. The characters keep the ball rolling, and boy does that ball roll. The characters are immediately endearing; you feel their pain, their inner conflicts and you can relate to their tragedies. Best of all, you can sense certain nuances and subtleties in their interactions. A good three out of six episodes is spent carefully crafting these characters, the heavy action does not enter the picture until well after the middle of the fourth episode. This never tries your patience however; the pacing could have been better but the characters are so interesting that you are compelled to watch. Hence, more character driven scenes only really come off as deliberate, never boring or slow. 
When the action finally does hit though, it hits hard. The action is pure super robot, the design of the titular mecha evoking designs like Mazinger or Gaiking. Animation-wise, this is pure --s anime bliss. Bright colors punctuate the zeerust designs of the spaceships and the alien designs follow the Giger-esque trends of the time. You'll also be treated to some of the best shirt-ripping (yep, an excuse for more tits), attack screaming, hot-blooded mecha action around. It is during these scenes that Gurren Lagann's homages become readily apparent. Tropes include the classic arms folded badass pose and the impassioned ""get a hold of yourself"" speeches.  
When the OVA finally winds down in the sixth episode, the action and drama have been blended and meshed nearly perfectly. This is the episode that feels the most like Hideki Anno's other works, namely Evangelion in some parts. The final episode is deliberately monochrome in order to emphasize the drama. It works incredibly well, especially in concert with the now legendary ending. Admittedly, the first few episodes could feel tedious to some, but it is absolutely worth sticking around until the final episode simply because the ending is so incredibly well done. It's almost safe to say that the reason this OVA is so fondly remembered is because of the sheer emotional impact of those final scenes. If you are in any way a mecha, sci-fi or Gainax fan, you must watch this OVA. For good reason, it is widely considered a classic and I'm kicking myself over not experiencing it earlier.  
After finishing episode six, I felt that on it's own merits Gunbuster is a near-perfect OVA. However, Gunbuster does have a sequel: Diebuster, released in ----. I almost felt as if a newer, modern sequel would never do this classic justice nor would it complement it. 
I was wrong. Really wrong.  
On to Diebuster...

Yeah! This is my first review of Winter ----. Oh yeah. Before I get on with the review just let me put some more nails in the coffin which now lies the ecchi jokes. Excuse me for a second. 
Ok. I'm done.  
STORY (-): 
Absolute Duo or Absolute Hatred follows these two bland characters by the name of Tor Kokonoe & Julie Sigtuna who attend Koryo Academy where they are trained in combat skills using Blaze. Blaze are supernatural weapons that suit different combat skills.  
Let me tell you that I have - expectations when going into this anime. The concept is boring and it is an ecchi genre. In fact, after that horrendous atrocity known as Rail Wars, I wasn't looking forward to watching this anime. So you know what, why not I review this anime. 
You might say ""Why are you viewing an ecchi anime with expectations?"" My answer is ""I'm sorry. My butt cannot stand being violated by Winter Season Anime especially when it comes to ecchi jokes."" 
This anime has some of the most horrendous dialogue and horrendous jokes I have ever seen since Rail Wars. There is one scene which is the worst scene I have ever seen in this anime. It is when Tomoe meets Tor for the first time, she keeps apologizing and jumps onto Tor and her head lands on Tor's crotch. Then some pauses and ""I'm Sorry!"" again and then Tomoe does another flip and Tomoe's butt landed on Tor, and pauses again. Rail Wars did that kind of joke like when Takayama accidentally gropes Haruka's boobs, there was a pause and then ""I'm sorry"". Seriously, how many times must an anime follow that kind of rule? I'm sorry, whenever I think of that scene, I always cringe inside. 
There is also this girl get embarrassed when guy looks at the boobs. Bouncing of boobs. Beach episode. I can't take it. 
Oh yeah, there was the fight scene between Miyabi & Tomoe. How they end the fight scene was so ridiculous. It ends with Miaybi saying ""I've been foiled by the power of love"". 
At the very end, they tried to tie everything together and it was a fail. The fight scenes were rushed. 
ART (-): 
The animation is nothing impressive. When it is dark, it is very dull. The action scenes are all dull and boring. These action scenes are all the ""Been there, done that"" action scenes. I never pay attention to the action scenes because I don't care anymore. 
SOUND (-): 
The opening and ending are not memorable. 
CHARACTER (-): 
Where do I begin? 
Tor & Julie might be like the new Sora & Shiro. However, Tor is more generic than compared to Shiro. His personality is as interesting as Edward Cullen. Especially, Julie, she is just another Bella Swan, who clings onto Tor with no personality. 
Tomoe Tachibana - Her voice actress is Ayaka Suwa who voiced Tokaku Azuma from the atrocity known as Akuma no Riddle. She had the potential to become an interesting character like Mikazuki Yozora from Haganai. However, her character is annoying by apologizing to Tor a lot of times and she get into comedic misunderstandings with Tor. 
Miyabi Hotaka - What can I say? She is the most generic character I have ever seen.  
Lilith Bristol: I also have nothing to say about her. She is just an generic tsundere. 
The teacher bunny by the name of Rito Tsumiki was so annoying. She tried to sound cute but she sounded more like nails scratching on chalkboard. The voice actress Yukari Tamura, her voice is no longer funny or cute, her voice was just annoying. Your cute voice is no longer relevant anymore, you just sound like a broken record player trying to work. 
K is a generic villain. He looks like Gilgamesh from Fate/Stay Night. However, his personality is as interesting as a cardboard box. K only appears on the later half of the show. 
CONCLUSION (-): 
I am so tired of these clichéd ecchi jokes. They are not funny or entertaining anymore. I didn't get a boner in any of the episodes. They are just cringe inducing. Saekano at least tried not to use these ecchi jokes but instead focus on good character development and serve its purpose well. This anime on the other hand tries to use all those ""been there, done that"" jokes and try to pass it off as entertaining. NO! You don't do that!  
Ecchi jokes don't work anymore. Anyone who is planning to make an anime, DO NOT use ecchi jokes. Ecchi jokes are dead. They are not funny. All the ecchi jokes are just cash-grabbing, like to take people's time. I value my time and money and you should too. If you want to make a good comedy anime, do not use ecchi jokes. Make a good story with effort. There is no bigger crime than an anime that is meant to make people laugh or have a boner failed to do that. 
This anime might not be a complete atrocity unlike ""Pupa"". But just like ""Pupa"", this anime is a prime example of the continuing bad practices of anime companies producing terrible anime in Winter Seasons. Especially when it comes to Ecchi genres. 
I don't have any expectations. The reason why I give this anime a - out of -- is because the voice acting was decent except for Yukari Tamura, decent fight scenes and the animation at least wasn't bad compared to Pupa. Way to start my first review for Winter ----, well done ""Absolute Duo""!  
I now need to rest my head because there are more reviews to come for Winter ----.

Critic’s Log - Earthdate: August -, ----. Review #--: Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season -). 
Well, after reviewing the Main Series, and the three movies. It’s time that I go over the last entry in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This is going to be my penultimate review of the Legend of the Galactic Heroes franchise. Here’s my review of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden : One Hundred Billi... Ah, screw it. Here’s my review for Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season -) 
Before I begin, the Prequel series to Legend of the Galactic Heroes is told in short stories. These short stories fill in the background of Reinhard von Lohengramm and Siegfried Kircheis before the start of the main Legend of the Galactic Heroes series. In these stories, they journey to a planet of ice and are betrayed by someone. They investigate a probable murder at their alma mater, Kircheis takes a vacation and gets involved in a plot against an admiral, and finally a ---episode story of Reinhard at Iserlohn, a battle fortress that protects the Galactic Empire from the Free Planets. That’s all the plot summary I’ll give you. 
To be technical, this is a production from Artland and Kitty Films, both these studios worked on the previous entries in the franchise and the animation was pretty good in the Main series, it’s sometimes hit and miss in this first season of the Prequel “Gaiden” series. This can be a little obvious with the character designs in some moments of this season but it looks really good in the side story “A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights”. The animation is not as consistent like the Main series was, but it’s still pretty good for the most part. 
The music which is used from classical composers is still used well here and just like the main series, the use of classical music is still terrific. 
When it comes to voice acting, The casting is still pretty solid. Ryo Horikawa is still great as Reinhard. Masashi Hironaka plays Kircheis the way he has done before and he’s still great in the show. Hozumi Goda plays Yang Wenli this time and this was because Kei Tomiyama passed away before the Gaiden series was made and Goda-san had to fill in the role. But he does play Yang Wenli great for the most part. Even though Tomiyama-san was terrific as Yang Wenli, it is a bit different to hear someone else play him. But Goda-san plays the role well enough. I think that’s all I will say about the casting. It’s still just as good as the Main series. I know I’m cutting this topic short, but there’s not a huge cast in this prequel season. Not to mention, Reinhard and Kircheis are the one with prominent roles in this show while everyone get’s minor roles and cameos. Look up the casting at your own leisure. I’ll say it again. The casting’s great. 
When it comes to characters, This entire season is focused on Reinhard and Kircheis. These short stories give the two the background we wanted to know. If you liked Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Reinhard and Kircheis’ background stories mostly will not disappoint. Reinhard’s motives in the main series are fleshed out pretty well in the short stories of this prequel season. Kircheis’ background does fully flesh out his character since most viewers of the show know that he was killed off at the end of Season - of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. So it was nice to see more of Kircheis in this prequel season. There will be some familiar faces throughout these short stories. 
When it comes to the short stories. Allow me to give you my thoughts on each story arc since the count is under --. The first story is The Silver-White Valley. It tells of Reinhard and Kircheis’ first military assignment and This was a pretty good start for the prequel series. The second story is Dreams of the Morning, Songs of the Night. This wasn’t an unanimously praised story arc but I actually liked it. Sure, Reinhard and Kircheis are tasked to do detective-like work, which may sound cliche at first glance, but since Reinhard and Kircheis are part of the Military Police during this story arc. The whole detective thing doesn’t bother me too much. This story arc is a bit hit and miss but it isn’t terrible. The lowpoint of this prequel season is the third story arc Dishonor. In my opinion, this was the most boring story arc of this prequel season. This whole story arc is centered on Kircheis and even though it was only - episodes long, I thought it was boring. If you like it, I’m glad you enjoyed it. I personally didn’t like it that much. The fourth and last story of this prequel season A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights is -- episodes long and it’s a pretty darn good story arc if you ask me. It’s paced pretty well and there are some slow moments, but it will feel like the time when you watched the Main Series (that’s if you’ve watched the whole thing). I guess the question is... Is this prequel season worth watching? The answer... Yes. This prequel gives us backstories of Reinhard and Kircheis. If you liked Kircheis in the series. These backstories tell more about him. But if you liked Reinhard, you won’t be greatly disappointed with his backstories all that much. To my surprise, this was not a bad prequel series. I usually get worried about prequel entries to certain series. I remembered that Star Wars came out with prequels and you know the story there. All i can say is that the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy could have been better. The prequel series to Legend of the Galactic Heroes as far as this season is concerned is mostly good. It’s not perfect, but it holds up for the franchise pretty well. 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season -) has not been licensed in the U.S. The only way to experience this show is to watch it online if you can find it. Once it does get licensed. Get this show if you must. 
With all that said. the first season of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden is a good prequel entry to this massive anime space opera. Even though it’s told in short stories, it mostly has watchable story arcs, good animation, great casting, more backstory, and great use of classical music. This show does suffer a little bit with a certain story arc, inconsistent character designs, and some slight inconsistencies with animation. These are just nitpicks. But it is still a good watch if you like Legend of the Galactic Heroes. 
I give the first season of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden a -.- out of --, it is EXCELLENT! 
Feel free to leave a comment. I have one more review left for the Legend of the Galactic Heroes franchise. This franchise has been quite the voyage. But until then. Class Dismissed!

Unlimited Botched Works. No seriously, that's what this show is. For reference, I've only watched Fate/Zero and half of the DEEN adaptation of Fate/Stay Night before this, and I was left pretty disappointed.  
First, the visuals. You may expect me to praise them to death, but I won't. Don't get me wrong, the gradients and textures are polished to a remarkable degree, and the CGI implementation is flawless, but there's more to visuals than just the technical side. The artistic side is what falls flat, which is a shame considering it's ufotable. Where Fate/Zero had plenty of sharp edges to its objects and harsh shadows to enhance its dark tone, UBW just looks shiny, which doesn't contribute to any specific themes from the show. Not to mention most of the fighting animation flies by so quick you can't see anything that's going on. When there's no fighting, it's even worse. Camera angles and character animations during conversations are usually pretty bland and static, and something about the faces in the characters just scream a lack of detail. So even though the show looks super shiny, it was honestly really boring to watch, due to the artistic elements coming short. Music is decent but there aren't too many memorable tracks this time around. 
So what is this show even trying to accomplish? I... don't know. That's by far UBW's biggest problem; ufotable (or whoever was in charge) seemed to want to do everything, but it just doesn't combine into a coherent show. Does it want to follow-up Fate/Zero? That can't be, because of the large tone difference and how it doesn't try to neatly wrap up character arcs lingering from the previous series. Does it want to be a standalone work? No, there's too many references to Fate/Zero. A faithful adaptation of the visual novel? No, there's too many important anime-exclusive arcs and scenes. A lighthearted moe dating simulator with every girl digging Shirou? No, because there's too much edgy stuff; but it can't be a serious and dark show either because there's too much out-of-place moe or other shlock bogging it down. The writing for this UBW is truly incompetent, and the characters are victims of this.  
Ohhhhh boy, the characters. To give my full thoughts, I'll need to spoil, but let me make a sweeping statement and say that they're not very good. At all. They're just a flawed concept overall; especially our two heroes. The characters with potential don't receive enough time to be fleshed out before biting the dust either. 
(SPOILERS AHEAD) 
Let's start with Rin. She joins a brutal war that she knows took her father's life and risks her own for.... fun? You're kidding, right? Not even to win the grail? She's also supposed to be a cool-headed and intelligent mage, but behaves like a five year old when around Shirou. Any competent tactician should not get flustered so easily and have ""tsundere"" as such a big part of their thought process. It's not cute, it's aggravating; especially when their romance goes nowhere. At the end she LIVES WITH Shirou and yet they still aren't in a proper relationship, considering Luvia still believes she has a chance. Why does Rin even like Shirou? She even tried to literally kill him at one point, and legitimately threatened his life on other occasions. Rin is just a horrible concept of a character, which is a problem considering she's our main heroine.  
Shirou? You've already heard the horror stories of him. He's excruciatingly naive and idealistic, and still largely retains his ideals despite being proven wrong on too many instances to count. The fact that he says ""just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right"" (if there's no translation errors) proves this. When he's not frustrating to watch, he's boring. Most of his dialogue consists of platitudes. Needless to say, I don't ship Shirou and Rin.  
Archer was decent but should've been the main antagonist. Gilgamesh basically hijacks the plot from him even though he's a far less thematically relevant villain. There's no debating with him, he'll just toy with you and then impale your body. While an entertaining villain, he's a poor fit for this show. Caster was pretty good though, she really does feel like a genuine threat considering how many times she thwarts our heroes and even steals Saber. Oh that's right, Saber! She's boring and lacks the strong sense of chivalry she had in Fate/Zero. When Saber lost, I didn't feel a thing, because she was always just kinda there. Didn't do much on her own accord; just followed orders with a straight face. At least Saber's good waifu material, right? Well, UBW thinks so, considering the completely pointless bride dress she was forced to wear. Ilya and Berserker also had potential, but really needed more than just one episode to develop their characters. Lancer is cool but you don't really get to know him much. Almost everyone else isn't worth mentioning. Their motives are so unclear and resolution so unfulfilling that it's obvious the writers didn't care, so why should I?   
(SPOILERS END)  
I apologize for the length of this review, but it was a long time coming. It really pains me to say that UBW is an immensely disappointing show. The only reason I don't give it a less-than-mediocre score is because of the visual polish and a few great scenes and episodes such as the -rd or --th ones that built up tension really well. But really, if you loved Fate/Zero and want a followup, or experienced the visual novel and want it done justice, don't bother. Leave those memories untainted. Newcomers will also be confused due to all the references to the Fate franchise's expansive lore. Please don't watch UBW; it's not a bad show, but it's so frustratingly average (or even worse) that it'll only waste your time.

I am writing this review to talk about the flaws in Made in Abyss. This show is amazing, and is a must watch, but it has a few flaws that stood out to me, and it's a shame that they exist in an otherwise amazing show.  
The art, animation, and sound direction is stunning, and is a huge highlight of this show. My main flaw in this area lies in the art direction of monsters around the beginning of the show. The painterly styled creatures look disgusting in a world that is going for the totally opposite look. Thankfully these creatures were only shown in such a disgusting manner during the start of the series. Now I am fully aware that this could of been a design choice, but it shouldn't be a reason to back it up, Ping Pong the Animation gets flack for its art direction, and yet this show gets a free pass just because people choose to look past these 'minor' flaws.  
Characters are great for the most part, problem is, is that most characters are merely there to just fill up the screen, and add a few explanation lines. Before anyone gets annoyed that I stated this despite this being the case for most Anime, I'm more talking about the importance of a character. If a character is gonna be a background character, it's fine for them to be unimportant, and just fill up the screen, but when you have characters that are more leaning towards side characters, you expect them to get some more fleshed out reasons for them to exist. Problem is, because of the rapid speed of the show, with an enormous amount of time-lapses to skip past unimportant scenes, you will have a character spit out a few lines of dialogue, to have them just turn into a background character that will soon disappear. Now you could also say this is used a lot, but when you're saying ""This character is a black whistle, and works for blah blah, and is really skilled"", you expect them to be more fleshed out past saying little to no lines. The side characters that do get a lot of dialogue when introduced seem to be the most boring characters, and it's really sad that they exist, there is of course exceptions, Mitty is a good example of a side character that holds a lot of weight as a side character, and she doesn't even speak words for the most part. A good example of a characters like this, is all of Riko's friends, they talk for a lot of time at the start of the series, and then that's it, I know that there's a reason for that, but even then, it just seems characters add barely anything to the story. The main cast is interesting for the most part, but Riko is a bitch of a protagonist. Regu is constantly having to help her, and in the one episode where he is past out, and she goes off to get food and gets in a lot of trouble, making the moment really good for character building, they end up building her up into realizing that she is useless without Regu's power... This is fucking annoying, and made the whole episode useless, with her barely surviving, and having seen all her love ones as hallucinations, making it really emotionally gripping, just for her to just about fight off a difficult creature, and then have Regu wake up to save the day, it's fucking retarded, and I can't stand it. This section was a bit nit picky, but I did feel like this first season built up Regu mainly, and then just had Riko come along for the ride, despite her being the protagonist. The other main characters are cool, mainly Ouzen and her sidekick Maruruk, and Nanachi and Mitty, but other than that, most characters lack substance, and end up just disappearing from the show anyway.  
Now for the main criticism I can give this show: The writers weird need for child characters to be naked, or sexually harassed. Now some of the scenes where the show, shows a character being naked, make sense. Riko strung up and whipped naked is controversial, but it's happened a lot of times in history, and is mainly a form of punishment, It's not used as a bondage fetishist scene. The character peeing/vomiting on themselves while in immense pain, or in a comma, that makes sense to strip and clean them. The characters going for a swim. Now this may sound weird that I've listed this many different examples, and some of these even repeated themselves, and this is where I see the main problem. Along with all the sexual jokes about Regu having a real penis despite being a robot, the talk of whipping Maruruk, and the fact that despite being a boy he is dressed as a girl, the talk of anal probing by Riko when conducting test on Regu, the writer seems to find it amusing, or maybe even satisfying to try and include this many forms of low key sexualization of children. It's wrong, and I don't want any of you Loli elitist to defend this. I do think for the most part that he did a good job of writing it in a way that disguises it as not a problem, for they are merely getting naked for the sake of the situation, but tied in with all the fucked up perversions that are talked about in the show, even talking about Regu's dick getting erect while in a pool with Riko, while this makes sense, it's again, just too much, and not needed. If it was kept down a notch, and not imported so much into the show, I might have given the show a -- tbh.  
To conclude, the lack of character importance/development, and the ignorance of the main characters need to develop, tied in with some off putting animation/art problems in the start, wrapped up with pedophilic tendencies, you end up losing a point from the rating scale from me. Now this does not mean it's bad, but I feel as all these reviews praise this show, and don't address the flaws, a review like this is needed. A single point lost from this is not much despite all that I talked about, reasons being is that the writer is just too clever in his development of the story, that it's hard to use these points against the show. It's a great show, and it shouldn't be condemned for its flaws, but shouldn't be blindly forgiven for them as well.

When this anime was first released out in ----, I wasn't immediately hooked into this series until late ---- after finding out how high this show's popularity was. So, I just took a shot at watching this anime to see how well it displayed.

To begin with, I've read the summary for this anime a lot of times and one day when I reread it again, I didn't think it would really center a lot around ""memories"" and I certainly didn't expect that would be so important in the plot. So I thought that this anime was going to be another boring Slice of Life anime. 
But I was wrong, and I wasn't just wrong in how well it displayed in the first few episodes. Episode one started off normally like any other anime and the fact that it was a college setting made it a bit interesting as I've been sick of watching high school characters (they tend to be annoying, especially with how they are portrayed). 
The main character's amnesia, I thought it was only a portion of the anime and that it won't be brought up again (thought it was just a filler for his background story), but after around episode -, I realize that this anime may just leave me wondering how the choices the MC makes counterargue with me and the rest of this anime. 
I can agree with others in that the story was interesting because I've never seen any other anime with this kind of plot. Sure, amnesia has been around a few animes, but this one involved with his past conflicting with his current self, which leaves me with questions about amnesia and whether someone should really try to go back to their past self. 
The Romance genre has never been good with me because after a while, I just drop the series because there's nothing left to tell after the MC just gets together with the other person. Since the plot centered around this fast-paced and out of the blue romance relationship between the two MCs, I thought that there was literally no character development at all, it didn't appeal to me and worst of all, that's not how real life works (yes, this is anime world so I don't blame the author). 
Art: - 
Nothing wrong with the series's art, but sometimes I feel really angry when seeing the two MCs face, comparing with their personalities. The other characters and their design with the art looks unique but they kind of dull in with every moment the anime goes on. 
Sound: - 
I probably shouldn't rate sound a - because I didn't even turn my volume on when I watched this anime. I never saw and heard the opening song and ending song, and I've, of course, didn't get to hear any background music. I didn't hear any sound and was fine with it, but I could almost imagine their voices, and the voice actors were fine, nothing wrong with them. 
But to be fair, even if I didn't hear the music, I won't rate it a -- because that's unlogic. All I can say is that art and sound were about the same. 
Characters: - 
Trust me, there really are characters that are immediately unlikable and not even worth mentioning, and I'm sorry to put this, but about --% of MCs just don't go along with my head and this may only just be my opinion. 
The main character acts like a goody-two-shoes and a nice guy that seems to have his way of talking to the main character girl easily in the first few episodes and it just centers around them too much, there's no space for other characters to get close with the MC girl. 
Tada Banri - The MC wasn't unlikable in the first start, but after his problem with amnesia reappears, I just couldn't take it anymore. His conversations and attitude with Koko was very annoying and knowing that they were meant to be the main couple, I actually didn't want him to be with anyone in the end, aside from Linda after knowing who she was. The only thing I like about him was his past, maybe I should say that his ghost was one of the characters I like. 
Kaga Koko - She was annoying but I didn't despise her in the first place (it shocks me that I actually felt bad for her in the first place when it's her fault for being a stalker and obsessive/weirdish kid). The cover of the anime mainly showed her and I already didn't want to know anything about her and she looked like the only one who's capable of wearing other clothes, whereas the rest were plain and nowhere to be found. She even looked more adult than the rest (but her personality is worse than that of an adult) and I thought it was a story of an older woman with a younger man after her first appearance in episode one. 
The way she says ""love"" makes me think that the author didn't put enough effort in her. It felt as if she was a person who was very hard to avoid and disappear in someone's life (with what happened to Mitsuo) and then all of a sudden, someone totally capable of giving up love for him and then falling in love with another person. It really bothered me with why the MC chose to go out with someone like that instead of someone who was interesting, like Linda. 
Linda - the first time she came out, I was thinking ""Oh, another character that will not get together with the MC"". But after knowing her past with Banri, I really started liking this character and hoped for the MC to get his mind and head straight and leave someone like Koko. His thoughts about amnesia made me hate the MC because if I had amnesia, I wouldn't want to lose my identity and start over with no one to know (of course, this is just my opinion). 
Mitsuo, Oka Chinami, -D-kun - characters who are just like placeholders for ""friends"". -D-kun was suddenly part of the group and only served for a few lines and his personality began to contradict with his name and it didn't make any sense to even have him with just a few information about his likes and his name. Oka Chinami was a likable character at first and after Mitsuo started to take an interest on her, I thought they would have some character relationship development, but no, there was not. Mitsuo just started to take a liking to another person and then Oka realizes this and starts to feel for him without any mentioning of how or any way of distributing this information in the viewer's eyes. It's always about the MCs and not them, these characters' stories get nowhere and no result except that we know the MCs are the ones who get together. 
Enjoyment: - 
To be honest, I actually enjoyed the series because of the plot. I enjoyed some of the characters even though they only have a little of screen time. When once the idea of amnesia awakes in an episode, it makes me want to know more only to know that the MC will have to have some time with Koko for a progressive romance, and it felt like the anime doesn't really cover that until the last episode. And the last episode wasn't enjoyable because of Linda's reply and it felt rushed and we never get to know whether she meant it or not, so how could Banri's ghost just be satisfied with just that answer? The MC returns with amnesia and amnesia can be like this, but I don't think he can just turn back and turn new and realize what is his best and true decision is. 
Overall: - 
The story was good but it didn't keep me watching. I ended at episode -- even though I decided to go to Wikipedia and read the plots for each episode to see how the author was going to manage the conclusion and watched the last episode.

What is it that draws one towards the most unlikely of relationships?  Is it the ""underdog"" qualities, where one desires to see the more ""unfortunate"" character have something wonderful happen to him/her?  Or would it be more along the lines that a ""perfect"" couple is just plain boring and those unlikely pairs are just fantastic to watch, making for an amazing story? 
Toradora introduces itself into the romantic comedy genre in a method where the two unlikely characters start off by liking the other's best friend.  However, the progress of each character with their personal love interest proves to be both entertaining and relatable.  The story begins with Ryuuji Takasu accidentally finding the confession letter of Taiga Aisaka, intended to be given to Yuusaku Kitamura (Ryuuji's best friend).  Taiga storms Ryuuji's room with a wooden sword, but Ryuuji reveals that he has a huge crush on Minori Kusheida (Taiga's best friend).  Both decide to help each other in this odd little love square, giving way to hilarity, mischief, drama and of course, romance.  Combine that with the rest of a fantastic cast of characters and the result is a romantic-comedy quite unlike any other I have seen.   
When I began watching Toradora (just a month or so after its initial release), I soon caught up with the airing date and was checking daily for the subbed version's release.  That in itself should give away just how much I came to enjoy this wonderful show.  Typically I like to review in a very systematic process; giving individual scores to each category and totaling them up to give an overall score out of --.  But I feel that if I left it at that, I would be leaving a lot untold about this great show.  So I will give a follow up after my categorical review, for those of you who want a synopsis of my review, or just the ""meat"" and the bottom line. 
** STORY --/-- **     
It takes several things to make a phenomenal story, such as an intriguing plot-line, a believable setting, characters and of course, conflict.  Sometimes, these components come together in such a way as to leave a tale that is worthy of being told and retold.  Toradora presents itself as one of these such tales, having all the workings of becoming one of my favorite stories.  Establishing itself as a school-slice-of-life with romantic, comedic and dramatic elements, the story progresses with quite a satisfying pace (save the last - episodes, -- particularly, but that's another discussion entirely) and leaves the viewer desiring to know what happens next.  Each element of the story seems to be quite well balanced; comedic relief comes into play after a dramatic or tense moment to keep a light-hearted mood, the romance never seems too sappy or unrealistic (I'm sure you've seen those shows where the guy is surrounded by women who SOMEHOW just adore him without even knowing him) and generally speaking, each episode is truly enjoyable from start to finish.  As for the driving factors in the story's progression, the conflicts that show up are mostly internal, character-driven problems; those that you would expect in any typical classroom setting.  Ryuuji's single mom, Taiga's lack of parents even present in her life and the mere fact that their rooms are right next to each other give rise to many of the story's great problems and triumphs alike.  This has been, by far, one of my favorite, realistic story lines I've ever seen.  There were so many times that I felt like I could relate to any number of the characters that it felt as if I was watching a story based loosely on my own personal life.   
** ART  -/-- ** 
Now that an incredible story has been etched out and realized, what is the most efficient way to portray the events?  This is where the art comes in, as the medium in which the writers ""show"" how the story unfolds.  Ryuuji, with his ""scary, delinquent eyes"" is drawn really well.  Taiga is so cute throughout, Ami is pretty darn hot, and even the rest of the characters have their own unique appearance that lends to the believability of their personalities.  Each scene looks to be pretty well thought out and plenty of attention was paid to the details.  For the most part, art is one category that is hard to put words to, and instead must be experienced first-hand. 
** SOUND -/-- ** 
Another key component to presenting the story is the sound department, including all the music, ambiance, object noises and voice cast.  Music wise, there's not much to say; the opening/ending themes are interesting, nothing to write home about, but can't really complain either.  During the show there's appropriate use of background melodies, but again, I was never floored by a scene because of some fantastic music.  Ambiance is spot on, many times a busy street sounds like one, the noise of cooking food, the sound of a street all sound pretty darn realistic and blend in smoothly.  Every object noise sounds like a live-sampled sound, in decent quality.  Doors, windows, footsteps even all sound great.  But the thing that pushes my score up to a -/-- is the amazing voice-cast.  Each character is acted out incredibly well; emotions sound real, personalities even show up in the voices.  Again, sound is something that is hard to describe but must be heard and experienced. 
** CHARACTER --/-- ** 
If there were a category in which I could weight the score heavier, this would be it.  Characters are what sell an anime to me, along with the story.  I have a hard time watching shows in which the characters are hollow or empty, boring, or otherwise lack anything worth mentioning.  That being said, each an every character blew me away.  There doesn't ever seem to be a ""filler"" character; each one lends their part to the overall story and just ""fits.""  I almost guarantee you will find a character in which you relate to in some form.  Each one is well thought out, well planned and scripted extremely well.  Towards the end of the anime, lines from each character seem to fit with the personality they represent.  Several ""Yeah, you would do that"" moments appear, as the main characters are portrayed so well that you feel like you know them personally after a few episodes.   
** ENJOYMENT --/-- ** 
Of all the categories I review, this area should be taken with the biggest grain of salt.  What I find awesome, someone else may find horrible.   
So, with that, I give this category a --, simply because I liked spending the time watching this show.  I also began waiting (often times very impatiently) for the next episode to be released and subbed, immediately downloading and watching it (even if it was - in the morning).  After episode -- (where I caught up with the airing date) I began to watch each episode twice; once on the release date (usually a Thursday night for me) and again on the following Thursday before the next one aired, just to catch myself up with the story.  I don't regret it one bit, I laughed, then laughed again when I saw it again, knowing it was coming.  I will most likely be watching this again in a few months time, just because it was that good.  Also, the ending is very satisfying.  I have seen many an anime ending that was very cliche or just plain... stupid.  Not so with Toradora.  I felt good after watching it; it really resolved itself and finished off strong.  (Last episode... freaking awesome scene in it... you know which one I'm talking about, or you will know when you see it).   
** OVERALL --/-- ** 
A near flawless score from me, with art and sound being the only non--- scores.  This is definitely one of my top--- animes now.  Sure, several things could have made it better, but may have also taken away value from other aspects of the show.   
***** BOTTOM LINE *****   
Toradora is a very cute and enjoyable romantic-comedy, slice-of-life anime that is definitely a must see.  With a very satisfying and smooth pacing, there aren't too many dull moments, making this show very good for either a marathon viewing, or a slow, one-episode-a-week pace.  The incredible cast of characters are truly what brings life to this anime, giving a realistic and highly relatable experience.  Don't hesitate to spend the time watching all -- episodes; you won't be disappointed!

When I started watching this, I was hoping for something to satisfy my Naruto appetite. Same characters, goofy plots and art style. That's what I was hoping for. 
The characters lose everything that made them lovable in the original series and are made to look like idiots in this show.  
Granted, it is ""super deformed"", so everything wrong with it is intentional, but I personally don't know if I'll be able to stomach it. 
To be fair, the show has made me laugh out loud a couple of times. I think more than anything my disappointment with just how different everything is has made me write a biased review.  
Give it a try, you might enjoy it. Then again you might feel like you've personally been insulted by the creators.

A short review for the reader without much time: 
Story (-/--): Repetitive, it's always about killing some demon, and the demon always gets killed in the same way. Unsatisfying ending. 
Art (-/--): The art is probably the only good part of this anime. It is smooth and fairly detailed. 
Sound (-/--): Really not much to say. 
Character (-/--): I find the characters annoying because they don't change at all throuhgout the series, and are always up to the same things. The only characters there are are the repetitive main characters or the useless villagers. The only reason this got a - was because the character history was pretty good. 
Enjoyment (-/--): Enjoyable at first, but then the repetitiveness gets to you.

The Story: 
The premise is pretty simple: Your memory has been erased, you are being trained as an assassin, kill or be killed. Along the way there is plenty of action, betrayal, revenge, intrigue, drama, and a small smattering of romance.  
The series as a whole is broken up into three arcs with the first two being the most sophisticated, logical, and clever. I'd go as far as to say you even get a bit of the wonderful Death-Note-style intrigue/manipulation in the first arc. Unfortunately all that gold largely disappears in the -rd arc, where characters often make silly, needlessly complex decisions, arrive at illogical conclusions or undergo unexplained shifts in character. That being said, arc - is still entertaining and it doesn't matter because you're already hooked :). 
Art: The animation seemed pretty crisp to me. I don't have a background in art or drawing so I can't comment too much on this aspect. 
Sound: The music was pretty good as animes go. They play this one song that sounds like ""Clubbed to Death"". I haven't found it yet but it just has that kind of unrelenting mafia bad ass feel. The other stand out song was Cal's intro song (you'll see what I mean). It's called Battle of Crimsons and I really liked the way it melded piano and kick ass techno beats. 
Characters:  
The characters were very good. The series kept you fascinated by their decisions and their thought process. It made you ask yourself what would ""I"" do in this situation? How much would it take to make me kill? Would I behave like them? If you want a black/white, good versus evil kind of struggle this is definitely NOT the anime for you. There is lots of moral grey area, guilt and regret. Character development is strong during the first two arcs but then stalls in the -rd. Basically it becomes harder to relate to their decisions because many don't really make sense. I'll just stress that overall, the characters are engaging and fun. 
Enjoyment: 
I definitely enjoyed the series. Even though I felt like they could have done some things better they still delivered. I think it really depends on what type of anime you like. 
Overall: 
I gave this an -/-- overall because I think it does have some flaws and unanswered questions. Still worthwhile. 
Misc: 
Violence/Gore: Lots of gun violence! Definitely not for children or the faint of heart. 
Romance: moderate-minimal 
Sex/nudity: minimal-none 
Consistency: Some inconsistency in character actions/decisions.  
Ending: potentially frustrating w/ loose ends

Do note that I am reviewing this season of Higurashi ONLY, and that I am not including the events of Kai into this review. 
Okay, so, I'm not one for watching any show or movie that falls under the gore or horror genres. Many of my friends enjoy horror and gore, and since I hadn't really seen any before, I was reluctant to start this. This anime was kinda a stumble upon, and from this anime, I started to watch anime on a more regular basis.  When I started watching Higurashi, it was awfully confusing, and it was nowhere near what I had expected in what looked like to be a rather simple plot. I could understand why some people may have dropped it, but when I continued watching on, I found it rather rewarding and enjoyable. Just a note that there are a lot of laughing screaming girls around... 
It's kinda hard to explain the plot without giving too much away. To say it rather simply, a young boy called Maebara Keiichi and his family move to what seems to be a relaxed and quiet little village called Hinamizawa. After a few days, he becomes known around the village, and rather easily makes friends at his school. One day, he accidentally finds out about a series of murders and disappearances that take place around the village every June during the celebration of The Shrine God. These murders are believed to be a &quot;curse&quot; that falls upon one, when they have angered the Shrine God. The question remains open to you, as to whether the murders and disappearances are caused by human means, or whether it is supernatural. The answers are revealed to you slowly, and the truth may be a little startling. 
The story was mainly confusing, as I did not, at first, understand the concept of &quot;arcs&quot;. After a while, it became clear that this was more than a simple &quot;who dunnit?&quot; mystery. Each arc presented us with both questions and answers without going so far as to driving our brains into overdrive. The first half of the series told the story from Keiichi's point of view. The unknowns surrounding both him and the audience give us a feeling that we are in the same position as him, and that in order to uncover the truth, we have to decide ourselves what is fact or fiction, who is deceiving us and who are the people we can believe. The second half of Higurashi presented to us many answers. It revealed to us some answers, and the truth that may make you get the feeling that bugs are crawling beneath your skin... Certainly a strong plot, and a rather interesting way of presenting it, it did lack the suspense and tension that are produced by other anime. The plot stays firm, and does not veer off into something else. Everything is related someway or another. 
Now, personally, I don't really think you can call this &quot;horror&quot; though. The plot was very complex but the animation is rather horrible and of very low standard. It is very inconsistent and the position of facial features seem to vary every few episodes, giving a feel that this was a rather low budget anime. Don't get me wrong, the character design is fairly interesting, although a lot of the time, the facial expressions, the character's movements and &quot;camera angles&quot; did not match the expressions of what was being said (most notably, the ladder scene early in the series). Thankfully though, the animation is compensated by an excellent soundtrack and outstanding voice acting. The soundtrack is simply beautiful! It matches the tone and mood of each scene almost perfectly. The opening and closing themes were also excellent (despite the closings bad engrish), although there was room for improvement in the opening, but I think I'd be asking too much for an already very good opening. Exceptional performances by the voice actors, especially from Hoshi Souichirou playing Keiichi and Yukino Satsuki voicing both Mion and Shion. Rena's voice seems to fluctuate a lot, and varies every so often.  
Okay, so the animation is fairly terrible, and the plot at the start was a little confusing, although after watching it for the season, the complexity of the plot becomes clearer and what is revealed to be an interesting story, which I found very much enjoyable. Interesting and complex characters, high quality soundtrack and outstanding performances from the voice actors makes me give this anime an overall -.- out of --. For those who have watched this, if you haven't already, I would strongly suggest you watch Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai. Kai has many more answers to the series, and ties the whole thing together, although contains much less blood than this season.

Out of --- Nobles watching... 
-- were impressed!  
-- wished Frieza would come to blow up their planet after seeing the CG. 
- wanted some more substance from the plot but it's DBZ so whatever right? 
I've seen a lot of love and hate on this Movie and I wished I wrote something right after I saw it. First off, this Broly re-imagining was NOT the glorious franchise saving godsend many of the -/-- and --/-- reviews are claiming it to be. Second, I feel all the people who have been screaming angrily since Dragon Ball Super became a thing are going a little overboard with their -/-- and -/-- ratings. 
I found the film to be a pretty hype and enjoyable DBZ experience that was mostly really good but had me taken out of the action in a surprising number of other places. 
I think the smallest nitpick to make is something found throughout DBZ so it's hard to judge Broly here, but this wouldn't be as objective if I didn't mention the shoestring plot. Why is Broly's father so resentful of Vegeta's father when he treats his own son like a wild animal? Why is Goku STILL letting Frieza just roam around the universe killing billions? Why is Goku's mom so attractive? Point is to not think too hard and just turn your brain off for this one. You came for the visuals and the fights, right? Yeah! YEAH! 
Which leads into my biggest grievance with this film. In the opening sequence of the movie on planet Vegeta when the Frieza Force ships were flying around I chuckled to myself saying ""Ha ha look, the vehicles and spaceships look terrible and feel like a callback to the --'s era of my youth!"" but that feeling RAPIDLY changed as I realized that those horrible freshman art student tier graphics were permeating into the fights. It was really disjointing to see amazingly well drawn -d sequences cut to models that looked like they were ripped right out of Dragon Ball Fighterz. A solid quarter to a third of the fight CG had this lazy application of visual effects and I feel that when your ENTIRE FRANCHISE is built around muscle dudes yelling and fighting all the stops need to be pulled to make every bit of those sequences amazing. No one is going to make clips of those scenes and sell the blu-ray with them.  
That aside the parts that WERE traditionally drawn looked great! Bulma Verde is a great new character and I want to see more of her. (Mostly) Great fights and fun character interactions abound. It's just a shame, looking at the numbers this movie had a budget of -.- million USD. Battle of the Gods seems to be shooting sub - million and a movie like Redline is in the -- Million dollar range. I just wonder if it was a money issue. Could an extra - million have made this the best piece of Dragon Ball media ever or was this movie's shortcomings a result of a tumor that's wormed its way into the animation industry? 
Did I enjoy this movie more than Battle of the Gods? No. 
Did I enjoy this movie more than Resurrection F? I think so. 
Do these conclusions mean anything other than I'm gay for Beerus? Maybe?

Dont watch this anime. I am a huge yugioh fan, ive seen every series, read every manga, play the card game, and by god, this is ....just the worst. 
I will give that some episodes actually have some good animation, and on the whole i did like the music in this series, but thats the best thing i can say about it. 
So lets start with the story. The first arc is not great, however in a stereotypical yugioh way. I mean, GX and Zexal didnt have strong starts either, right? In fact I would say Arc-V's start is better than Zexal's.It has your standard introducing characters through pretty low stakes duels, and the show introduces a pretty neat concept. Using all the summoning methods. Now, this is a brilliant idea, and theoretically should make the duels in the series very interesting. However the duels in this series are by far the worst, and thats because of the other dueling gimmick they introduced. Action Cards. Granted, in the first arc, action cards werent that bad. They had varying effects and hell there were sometimes action traps that actually hurt you. So well it did provide a convenient excuse for the good guy of the episode to get out of a jam, it wasnt that bad. More on that later.The plot of the first season gradually builds up into what would become the premise of the whole series. There are - dimensions that are at war with each other. Sounds interesting doesnt it. They proceed to introduce a few characters from each dimension who make very cool introductions, and then move on to the second arc, which involves them going into one of those other dimensions. 
Now, here is where you start to see the signs of the show getting bad. The first dozen or so episodes in this arc are a complete stall for time with no real plot development.They introduce some more characters and include some fanservicey ones in order to draw in those -Ds fans. Now having characters from -Ds show up would be quite cool...if they were actually them. These are jsut characters with the same names and designs however, the Jack you meet isnt the one who fought the dark signers with yusei. its someone completely different. But back to the actual plot. Now youd think that , with interdimensional war happening, things would be pretty intense right? Nope! Most of this arc is taken up by a very slow tournament arc, that ends up doing nothing to help the cause of the heroes or the villains.Oh and all those cool characters who you wanted to see interact and develop with each other? Too bad, theyre locked in their rooms for most of hte arc.However there was a couple good episodes towards the end of this arc that really hyped up the overarching mysteries and seemed to really be leading somewhere, so i continued. Oh and the villain of this arc was a complete pushover who was so incompetent im surprised he managed to get his evil plan as far as he did. 
Now the third arc. Where it starts to get really terrible. So the cast gets separated again, jsut like at the start of the second arc! And of course most of the focus goes to the less interesting of the cast. They also introduce two GX legacy characters, who , if you love GX like i do are just....sad to watch in this series. They never get a proper win and , in fact, do more harm than good. This is where the series starts pushing the ""smile"" message way too hard. In a situation dealing with people living in a war zone and have gone through essentially genocide, and a group doing the genociding who believe that what they are doing is for the best, the solution is to have a really fun duel to solve it. And it works. All the problems there literally go away because of that. 
The fourth and final arc. What a mess. They finally give resolution to the mystery arc thats been building up and is very,very interesting in concept. However it is executed in the worst way possible. Its also around this time Action cards become unbearable. By this point you only see - different action cards.Evasion:negates an attack, Miracle:monster isnt destroyed and No Action:cancel another action card. Every . Single . Time.  Well, now since theyve bothered hyping up these action cards as the tools of the main heroes so often, surely they will be useful in defeating the big bad? No. The big bad prevents action cards from being used at all, which was nice to not have that annoyance for a few episodes but by god it made it so pointless. Now the duel against the big bad...just,so,so awful. He just defeats all of the  cast and then an insanely minor character shows up with the mother of all deus ex machinas and defeats him in one turn. The most unsatisfying final villain defeat ive ever seen in anime. They then spend the remaining - episodes getting a baby to smile. Not a joke, thats actually what happens and its as stupid as it sounds. 
Now on to the characters. The main character, Yuya, is insufferable. He starts off just eh, but with lots of room for development.However, he never actually develops. I would even argue he regresses. In a show that centered itself around a very serious conflict, youd think he would develop out of his naivete a little bit, or maybe not cling onto his childish ideals so hard. Hell ,even just have a few episodes where he gives up on them. But nope, if anything ,his stance on ""bring smiles through dueling"" only gets stronger every episode, and he goes around sequentially making everyone believe in it too.He learns nothing throughout the entire show, he doesnt even become a better duelist, he jsut gets more and more situational cards, which he wouldnt even need if he just played his deck well. 
The main female characters. So the main female character at the start is Yuzu and she starts it off pretty well, she gets a win against Yuya and actually does get some development. Then she gets kidnapped at the end of the arc and spends the rest of the show as a damsel in distress. Well, she does have about - episodes where she isnt lol. However, then they introduce Serena! Serena starts off even better than Yuzu and also gets some really good development. However after the second arc, she gets captured and also becomes a plot device. The other two girls, Rin and Ruri, are kidnapped before the show even starts and generally do nothing. 
Other characters. while a lot fo them start off strong and get a good - or - episodes focused on them, theyre generally dropped off and just spout  the same smile rhetoric as Yuya, dont get their arcs resolved, or both! Mostly both. Hell - of them end up dead at the end of the show and nobody really makes that much of a mention of it and they all act like its a happy ending. 
Villains. arc v only really has - villains, and im going to go through them all, so this section will be a bit spoilery. 
Roger:Huge idiot. His entire , very flawed, plan is to kidnap Reiji in order to use it as leverage to become more powerful than Reiji's father. However the audience already knows this is a futile endeavor as Shun tried this very early on , and it was made clear that Reiji's father didnt give a fuck about him.His dueling skills are also atrocious. He wouldve lost to two minor characters if it werent for this ridiculous system he set up where he got to try again and again if he lost. 
Leo:what a joke. This guy is built up as the villain for most of the series, and he is just an insane idiot. He had every single opportunity to stop the heroes from winning, and to succeed, but he makes the stupidest decisions possible. He nearly gets defeated by Yuya and Reiji and only doesnt lose because the duel gets stopped. Then he goes on to duel against the real big bad of the series, and loses in one turn. he doesnt even get to play a card. 
Zarc: The real big bad. This is where lots of spoilers come in. So hes the combined ""original"" form of Yuya, Yuto,Yugo and Yuri. Sounds cool in concept. Having someone with aspects of each of them would be interesting. However hes just an omnicidal maniac who stomps everyone he duels, until he gets defeated by a huge deus ex machina. 
Yuri:The only actually good villain. He was fun to watch, had an interesting deck, and was all around a troll. Sadly he was heavily underused. 
The duels themselves were just...so boring. Even putting aside action cards, no real interesting strategies were used, and everything just went on the ol' ""bring out ace monster, sit on it until you win"". The mosnter designs were not very good.The only deck i can say has interesting designs is Shun's.they were either waaaay too ""cute"" and childish,or were weird mashes of stuff together. 
So, to recap, dont watch this anime.

An outstanding story that was amazing for half of the series, and was ruined just because one character.  
Story - I Art - I Sound - I Character - I Enjoyment - I Overall: -.- 
So Zankyuo no Terror, tells a story about two young boys Nine and Twelve who become terrorist thanks to a problem caused by the Japanese government corruption, It introduce our characters with the making of a bomb on a crowded building but no one gets injured so whats the point behind this terrorist actions? Zankyuo no Terror gives you one hell of a story along with good display of how government corruption works.  
So Whats Good? 
+The plot of this series starts high paced, but its just outstanding you can get really good vibes of a truly masterpiece on just the first episodes, you just don't know whats going to happen at first, interesting riddles, stories that go along with the plot, just amazing 
+The characters start as strongly likable and unique.  
+Animation is one of the best features about this anime, just so aesthetically pleasing watch, and combined with the glimpses of soundtrack we get, is such a watch. 
+Amazing ending, although it was unbearable from ep - to -, it manages to have a really pleasant ending 
So what's bad? 
-Basically it can be defined as from ep - until ep -, Five is just unbearable to watch, no point of being the villian of the show, Five is just so unlikable even as a villain perspective, just awful. 
-Five was the main problem of this series, it made the high paced but interesting show to a slow and boring anime that was almost unbearable and nothing to be compared to the first episodes 
So best aspect of this show is the plot, that displays the true intentions of these ""Terrorist"", the animation that was so unique and the main characters aside from Five, it was a shame that it could have been better, but its still a really enteretaining watch

(MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS) 
Toradora! is (IMO) one of the few rom/coms that has very little flaws with a lot of things done right. I have seen a lot of the rom/coms out there and Toradora! instantly became my favorite show and still is.  
Story - - 
I really liked the idea of a romance that where neither of the main characters started out liking eachother. Instead, you get to see both of the main characters (Taiga,Ryuuji) grow over the episodes and see how there relationship changes from just a simple goal at the start to them having to come to understand the feelings they have for eachother. I found no experiences of cliche moments that you see happen over and over again in rom/coms. No forced comedy and not many flaws overall. No really forced humor which is a BIG plus.  
Art - - 
The animation and overall smoothness of the show is good throughout.  I love how in some moments the animation really shines i think near the ending/climax of the show and it fits the scenes perfectly for whats happening.  
Sound - - 
The sound fits the type of show Toradora! is. Its mostly a bunch of acoustic guitar and strings in the background music; but it has its moments where the soundtrack really does its job (""Lost my pieces"") on the emotional conflicts and aspects of it.  
Characters - -- 
The characters is why I have this as my favorite show and is the driving force behind what makes the show really worth it. Each characters like in other shows has their own set of quirks that make them unique, but Toradora! DOESN'T fall into the typical rom/com style with not having much depth and reason like most do. The most enjoyable part of the show is how each characters relationship is with each other and how they try to understand their own feelings with who and want they want.  
My waifu is best  
Yours is shit 
Tsunderes ftw ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆ 
Enjoyment/Overall - -- 
I very much enjoyed this show and will forever be (probably) my favorite show ever. I say its not for everyone especially if you cant stand tsunderes then you might find it hard since the show relies a lot on Taiga's character/personality. Besides that this is a perfect show for someone who loves romance/drama/comedy or looking for a first show to dip your feet into the genre. I was really satisfied with the ending and have rewatched the entire show - times.  
Hope it was helpful

また いつか! [Mata Itsuka] [See you Again Someday!]. 
Gintama' is not the end of the Gintama Anime. 
[ REVIEW ] 
DONDAKEEEE!! 
Gintama' is a series that, without doubt, captures almost every important essence of Anime (Comedy, Action, Drama, etc.) all within one show. 
While it may be true that Gintama is mainly focused on the comedy aspect, the series is able to embody many action scenes, especially in the Arcs, as well as drama and sadness. 
Contrary to popular belief, many don't want to start watching Gintama either because the series is too long, too 'overrated' in their eyes, or just does not pique their interest. However, when you actually get around to giving the series a chance, you will not be disappointed, and you will definitely be hooked. 
The Second airing of the Gintama Anime proves to be as enjoyable as the first one. Despite being shorter (-- episodes), Gintama' managed to pull off arcs filled with action, hilarious comedy, and more lovable characters (Such as Jugem-Jugem!) 
The second season also has a more improved animation style and a widescreen showing, unlike the first one. This is a definite plus for the show. 
It's really tough to describe Gintama in a review. So, if you're sitting down reading this one, I only have one thing to say: GO watch. 
And, don't forget, this is not the end. Gintama will definitely come back one day.

(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!) 
A few weeks ago, I shared a meal with my grandparents, brother, and other cousins. During the dinner, we talked about all manner of topics. Our grandfather’s brother named Georgie. The notion that bigger teeth brings beauty later in life. How awesome that grand meatball tasted. 
At one point, the topic turned to familial connections, the bonds we share with each other. I stated that I would die for them. They are my family, so this statement sounds obvious. At least, I hope it is obvious for most. 
I sincerely believe it. Strangers pass by. Friends come and go. But family. Family is forever. Yu of Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen believes the same. Unfortunately for Yu, he does not get to have dinner-made conversations. Instead, he gets an almost abysmal anime. 
STORY 
This second season (really the second half to the split-cour) of Owari no Seraph (called Nagoya from here on out) begins shortly after the first season (really the first half). 
The anime has a glaring issue that persists across most of this season: nothing actually happens. Hyperbole, yes. Events occur and characters move, sure. But the conclusions or outcomes are no doubt insignificant when the bigger picture is looked at. 
The anime has essentially five main conflicts that occur one after another. The first conflict is Yu’s team contrasted with Makoto’s team. The second is the multi-front battle. The third is the rescue attempt of Guren. The fourth is Yu aiding Mika. And the fifth and final conflict is the angel and demon clash at the end. Each conflict introduces drama, and each conflict does almost nothing. 
The first conflict is designed to accentuate the inexperience of Yu and the other members. They get beat by Guren and reluctantly accepted by Makoto and his team. A nice approach – except for that fact that Makoto’s team gets decimated over the course of a few episodes. Two members are killed off by some vampires, two others are killed off by the angel-demon contraption, and Makoto is left alone. Meaning the initial comparison has nothing come of it since the (supposedly) less experienced squad moves on without a single loss. 
The second conflict brings about a lot of action. People die, swords swing, and tension ensues. The purpose of the attack is to wipe out the vampires once and for all. But, as the anime shows, that is all a lie. The attack is nothing more than a sacrifice. In other words, the battling is just the myriad of characters and soldiers stalling for time – they are fighting for nothing. 
This conflict is hurt further by the audience knowing nothing of the situation. The audience learns next to nothing about the vampire society. The audience learns next to nothing about the behind-the-scenes deception of the vampires and the humans. The audience learns next to nothing about the more otherworldly aspects – namely the angels and demons. 
The third conflict revolves around getting Guren back after he gets captured. Yu being Yu, he decides to bring the fight to the vampires to save Guren, a man he considers part of his family. The resulting failure of the rescue – the attempt meant, in the end, nothing – is certainly an asinine development. But it is the later betrayal of Guren (regardless of whether he is in control or not) that turn his speeches on camaraderie and family into nothing. Plus, Guren ending up back with the humans means the rescue triply meant nothing. 
The fourth conflict is arguably the only one that means anything more than nothing. Established in the first half of the split-cour, Mika works to save Yu from the “evil” humans, forcing him to go to impossible lengths to save Yu. Furthermore, the conflict is the only one that exists throughout most of the season leading up to its finale in the grocery store. Mika becoming a vampire, despite fighting off the temptations for years and years, could arguably be more nothing-based drama. But this conflict, compared to the others, actually has a meaningful impact on both the characters involved. 
The fifth and final conflict is easily the sloppiest. The angel-demon contraption has nothing in terms of context. The vampires and the humans all do nothing as the demon comes forth. Krul Tepes is (supposedly) killed off when she does almost nothing to retaliate. Kazuki does nothing to save his sister despite how much his character is built on his strong relationship with her. Yu essentially resets everything back to how it was before the contraption appeared (minus a few characters), meaning nothing important happened plot-wise. 
Collectively, the narrative does next to nothing. 
ANIMATION 
Nagoya continues, for the most part, the artistic direction and actual animation that it had with its first half. 
The background art itself still has a painting-like quality to it. While the locations tend to blend together as grays, browns, and blacks, this dreariness contributes nicely to the dreary mood of the anime. Lighting is not as much of a focus, unfortunately, causing the anime to lose an opportunity to further cast darkness over the show. 
Nagoya’s animated sequences are a mixed bag. Downtime does have some fluidity in eye or head movements, and there are even subtle shifts, such as Shinoa moving her hair out of the way to better hear Yu’s heart or Yu scooching backward while Mika rests in his arms and bites on his neck. 
Of course, the anime also includes many a battle, yet, despite the swords, axes, and pikes, the anime rarely depicts choreographed fights. As such, the battles become less flashy and more simplistic with lots of cuts or smoke. Considering that the anime touts itself as having action, having these animated sequences be so lackluster adversely affects the anime. 
However, there are certain sequences that prove Nagoya does not always rest on its laurels. In particular, the sequence where Mika battles through a road of enemies to get to Yu involves a lot of movement, perspective, and coolness. Other sequences, like the final fight between Yu and the demon or Yu and the gang versus the top-hat vampire, while not as involved, make the anime less static than it tends to be otherwise. 
Lastly, the character designs remain the same as before. Shinoa, Yu, and the other humans are rather plain in design. Some have accessories like bows or glasses. Some have oddly colored hair. But generally their designs are not that intricate. The vampires are more eccentric than the humans, making the vampires’ designs more unique and therefore slightly stronger. 
For both groups, their actual outfits are decorated with buttons, medals, and other additions. Most interesting of all is the choice of color. The humans wear black attire whereas the vampires wear white. Color symbolism often dictates that black equates to evilness and white equates to goodness. Meaning, having the colors swapped between who one would usually believe the good and bad guys to be induces a subconscious muddying of morality. An idea that, while not explicit, has a presence in the anime. 
CHARACTERS 
The characters of Nagoya are difficult to discuss mostly because the anime refuses to properly do much with them – nothingness seeped into the characters, too. 
Out of the entire cast, only two characters receive adequate attention: Mika and Guren. 
Mika continues mostly where he left off. The vampires dislike or toy with him, he hates humans, and all he thinks about is Yu – and blood. His refusal to fully turn himself into a vampire by consuming human blood (he has satiated his thirst through Krul Tepes’s blood all this time) begins to consume him, and it is this consumption that Nagoya focuses on with his character for about three-fourths of the season. His inability to control himself, his anger at himself for his urges, and his conflicting feelings towards humans. 
All the while, he never stops thinking about Yu. His actions always revolve around finding or helping Yu and not disappointing him (by becoming the very creature that Yu hates). Consequently, in what is perhaps the anime’s smartest bit of writing, he and Yu finally reunite when Mika is at his most desperate. I.e., Mika’s thirst for blood and Yu reach an apex. 
Yu, valuing family above all else (more on this shortly), gives Mika exactly what he wants: himself. Yu shares a private moment with Mika, he gives Mika his blood, and he reassures Mika that Mika will always be family to him – vampire or otherwise. The moment is nice, signifying development of Mika’s character. Afterwards, Mika still has trouble trusting humans, but he at least comes around for Shinoa and the others, turning him into the best character that Nagoya has to offer. 
Guren is the other prominent character. Outwardly, he is a jerk, a rude and arrogant dude. Inwardly, he cares deeply for his squad mates – perhaps more so than anyone else. 
Over the course of the season, he leads, he falls, and he “betrays.” Quotes because it technically is not his fault. His weapon had been implied to be difficult to control due to the strength of the spirit possessing it and Guren’s love for said spirit. (Shinoa’s older sister in both cases.) So him succumbing to temptation is not completely out of the question. 
The real problem with the betrayal is that it (like the story) does next to nothing. Yes, Guren’s tears while in his possessed form indicate that his true self hates the kin-killing monster he becomes. But it serves little purpose. His actions do not drastically affect the outcome of the season. He does not confront major players besides Yu who, in response, just spouts even more dialogue on family. And, most importantly, Guren’s betrayal does nothing for himself. The betrayal (and, indeed, the whole season) does not provide growth for his character whatsoever. 
To be fair, Guren is humanized through a flashback involving him and Yu. He compares himself to Yu, encouraging him, advising him to live and push on until the day he can fight for the one who needs his help. Shinya, seemingly his best friend, also humanizes Guren indirectly: Guren wholly trusts Shinya, counting on Shinya to save everyone in his stead and proving how good a friend Guren can be. These instances make up for some of the improper handling of his character but not all of it. 
Now, due to the focus on Mika and Guren (and the focus on a story that does nothing), the rest of the cast is forgotten about. Deeply forgotten about. And that is putting it lightly. 
Yu starts to leave his him-against-the-world mentality, relying more on his comrades and acting more friendly towards them. However, he still spouts the same dialogue about family over and over. He is certainly consistent in his ideals which deserves a small amount of praise, but he repeats the same thoughts on family ad nauseam, turning him into an annoyance rather than a worthwhile character. He does seem to gain some control of his powers near the end of the season, but, because the angel and demon concepts had gone unexplained up to that point, his control does not make much sense. 
Shinoa, arguably the most popular character of the anime, loses her edge. In an attempt to mold her into a more serious, reliable leader, the anime cuts down on her smug, snarky attitude – her defining trait. The tradeoff, not surprisingly, failing to work. As a leader, she gets her group into horrible situations and even causes issues (and deaths) for others based on her decisions. And because her smugness heavily disappears, so does her intrigue. And despite her older sister gaining (a minimal amount of) relativity, Shinoa’s overall importance to the anime diminishes. 
The rest of the main group – Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi – are painfully forgotten about. Mitsuba has an older sister that seems to be working for the evil humans, but, similar to Shinoa, that relationship is not expounded on. Kimizuki gets a small moment near the end of the season where his beloved sister, the girl who his entire character revolves around, is subjected to horrific treatment. But when he is thwarted with a single sword stab and when he chooses to abandon his sister without putting up much of a fight, Kimizuki becomes more of a joke than a person. As for Yoichi, he may as well not even exist for how much the anime ignored him. 
Everybody else cannot be discussed because they are even less prevalent than these three. And as far as themes are concerned, the obvious one is family. Different aspects of family are shown as the season goes on. Yu proves how far people are willing to go for their family when he throws himself into the fray. The commander of the humans proves what happens when one does not care about family. And the notion that family means more than shared blood rings throughout the season. The anime does not explore family on the vampire side, so the theme itself is not as strong as it could have been, but the theme is explored to some overall extent nonetheless. 
A less obvious theme is that of temptation. Vampires are tempted by blood, and humans are tempted by freedom. But the theme is more nuanced than that. Mika is tempted (indirectly) by Yu. Guren is tempted by his weapon. Yu is tempted by family. For many of the characters, the prospect of attaining their desires drives them forward. To be fair, the theme itself has no outright exploration, but, since the angel-and-demon backdrop exists, the theme of sin – temptation and greed go hand-in-hand – cannot be ignored. 
Does Mika, Guren, and some themes make up for the incredible amount of other problems the cast have? 
Barely. Just barely. 
SOUND 
The opening track of Nagoya has to be talked about first because of how poor it is. The tone, especially in the beginning, is overly optimistic. As such, it contrasts too much with the dreary mood that the rest of the anime steeps itself in. The song also does not do the vocalist justice. She is either forced to sing in a standard, almost conversational tone or forced to strain for specific notes. The only interesting part of the piece is the otherworldly sound-effect that seems as though it is produced by dropping a piece of metal in an icy cavern. But (obviously) that is not enough to make the OP even remotely worth listening to. 
The ending track, however, is a lot stronger. The beginning and middle adopt a captivating tone that is simultaneously chilling and beautiful. Varying the pace of the piece also furthers the song’s complexity which in turn furthers its strength. This time, the vocalist can flex her prowess, matching the song’s highs and lows, quicks and slows. The ending lyric is a bit silly – a “Trick Star” does not make much sense in the context of the anime let alone in real life – but, overall, the ED stands as a nice addition to Nagoya. 
The original soundtrack (expectedly) uses the same kind of music that the first half used. Most of the tracks are filled with drums, triumph, and ominous sound-effects, setting the atmosphere in a manner that befits the oft soldierly show. None of the tracks are particularly noteworthy, however, so they remain as simple additions rather than praiseworthy ones. 
Voice acting sees a similar fate. Saori Hayami’s feminine voice for Shinoa is still attractive to hear. Miyu Irino as Yu can be a bit grating when he starts pouting or yelling. And Kenichi Suzumura as Crowley coats his words with a childish lilt. The only above average performance comes from Kensho Ono as Mika for the struggle and pain one can hear in his voice. 
ENJOYMENT 
This type of show, where the characters are in danger of being killed off or maimed or otherwise needing help, usually gets me. I have to know if the characters are going to be all right because I just do not like being kept in the dark about their safety. And so, I found myself being pulled along by this one. 
But that was the only trait keeping me interested. I was not a fan of any of the characters. Yu was too annoying; Mika was even more so. Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi were barely relevant. Guren was too much of a jerk, and the other vampires were either too arrogant to root for or too lame to take seriously. And since Shinoa lost a lot of her smug, she too was not as fun to follow. 
The action as well was uninteresting. None of the fights were cool or memorable. In fact, a lot of them blended together, especially when Yu and the humans almost never seemed to win or even succeed in any way. 
The anime’s comedic moments were sparse. The anime’s drama was not gripping. The anime’s romance could have been more pronounced. I was simply not entertained by the vast majority of what the anime set out to do. 
Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a slew of issues. The story does nothing, the characters are forgotten about, the animation is par for the course, the music likewise so, and, as a whole, it fails to entertain. Family may be forever, but, thankfully, this anime is not. 
SUMMARY 
Story: Terrible, so much nothing in the narrative it hurts 
Animation: Fine, nice background art, okay character designs, and about average actual animation 
Characters: Bad, themes on family and temptation surround Mika, Guren, and a spectacularly awful rest of the cast 
Sound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances 
Enjoyment: Bad, the safety of the characters was the only enticing part 
Final Score: -/--

If I have to describe it in three words- unfinished, distracting, incoherent. Vague, but I think others who watch the show will agree. 
__Unfinished__ 
It seems that all of the important scenes consist of still, blank characters. And I mean STILL. Like, either they don't move, or their mouths don't move, or often times both. See episode -- for a severe example. 
__Distracting__ 
Throughout the entire show, there are --frame scene cards that show up every ----- seconds saying either ""Red Scene,"" or ""Black Screen."" ----- seconds is generous, as sometimes they will show up within --- seconds of each other. It's absolutely dreadful, and the fact that they remove quite a few in the BD version shows how unfinished and broken the anime is. Chalk another one up for unfinished, as these are often used to replace blinking or mouth movements. 
__Incoherent__ 
Imagine watching a show that demands you to read a chunk of the story via paragraphs that show only for a frame followed by -- more said frames in succession. Well, with Bakemonogatari, you don't have to imagine it. It's awful. Or imagine watching a walk cycle that cuts to a sitting shot that cuts back to the same walk cycle- then back to the sitting shot. Pretty normal for a flashback but no- this is real time. You're expected to believe that as they're talking with one another, they are switching between sitting on a bench and walking within a single frame. 
The music direction is trash as well.

An aswesome opening, and nothing more, or maybe??? Lets check it! 
If you think this anime is telling something about the death, than your mind is cheated with the madhouse ""good"" fanservice, there are nothing behind the anime. The story was just tipical and recurring, but you can easily think that the anime's tale was much more better and interseting, but not! I just saw people who are close to the death, and after that they are ralized the truth... and everybody cried. The symbolism was great, for an exapmle they played well with the hair color, but belive in me, there are nothing more! 
The art was awesome, one of the best i have ever seen... The art of the opening and the ending was magnificent, i just enjoyed what i saw. The representation of the games fitted well with the mood. It was perfect! 
The sound was grat, but not that perrfect... I dont like any soundtrack from the anime, expect the opening. The seiyuus did a very good job with the voice acting WP! 
The character designe was avarage, nothing special, the two main characters was boring at all, and the supporting characters was'nt really represetated.

Not bad. Re:Zero the anime was a somewhat enjoyable run, and had moments of greatness. But as a whole, with its incomplete story and a number of other major issues, I just don't see it as a must-watch show. Don't get me wrong - it was pretty ""good"" - but is it something I would recommend in general? Not really. It also has probably the worst main character of any anime I've ever seen. 
**Spoilers Below** 
Keep in mind that I'm going to review just the anime itself as a standalone show. The light novel, OVAs, etc. that fill in the missing gaps won't be counted. 
Story:  
So anyway, I happen to love time loops. And in general, I loved the plot mechanics that Re:Zero had. There's something very appealing about time loops, and I believe that the way that this show handled them was quite good. In many ways it reminded me of Steins;Gate since the main character was able to retain his memories, and make decisions accordingly. That made for some really cool and satisfying moments in the story, although I feel that they abused the mechanic at certain points. 
And at the end of the show, we get a very happy ending. Subaru (kinda?) gets the elvish waifu after working his ass off and assembling an army to prevent her death, becoming a hero despite not being able to do much. It wasn't exactly a cliffhanger ending, which would have been awful, but it left me feeling unsatisfied. The end of the story doesn't really answer most of the questions that you'll develop watching the first twenty episodes of the show, and at the end you'll probably feel a bit blueballed. The scope of the show would have made more sense if the anime were --+ episodes, but -- wasn't nearly enough to handle all the material that was presented. 
Art:  
No complaints really. I don't really have much to say here. Colors were chosen well. 
Sound:  
I haven't listened to the whole soundtrack yet, and it's possible that there are some amazing tracks that didn't catch my attention while watching the show. But I wasn't crazy about what I remember from it. The weird high-pitched chant that plays whenever Subaru died was terribly annoying after a certain point. 
Character: 
Don't get me wrong, there were some pretty good characters. I'm mostly talking about the demon twins, especially Rem (the correct choice for best girl) who became very fleshed out by the end of the infamous episode --. And yeah there were a few others - Wilheim, Betelgeuse, the green-haired leader girl, etc. - but Subaru ruined everything. And because of the amount of screen time he gets, I feel like he single-handedly tanked the show for me.  
While I understand that a large part of the show was supposed to be about him being weak and pathetic, there were just so many character flaws about him that I couldn't find much reason to care about him or his mission. I don't want or expect main characters to be perfect, but this guy went too far in the opposite direction. Even if he becomes more bearable near the end of the show, there is simply too much crap to wade through to get to the good part where the focus turns to other characters. 
And yeah I have to bring this up, but him rejecting Rem after an ENTIRE episode of just him talking to her was painfully unsatisfying and lame. I assume that this was some sort of romance fork in the visual novel that they wanted to add into the show, but I feel that it should have just been one girl or the other from the start. All the time they spent on either Emilia/Rem relationship building could have been spent on a more detailed plot, or something better. 
Enjoyment: 
This could have been way higher if Subaru wasn't Subaru, and if they either cut elements out of the story to fit the length of the show or lengthened the show. The last few episodes, especially the hunt for the white whale, really showed me that this anime could have been an incredibly good adaptation had they approached it differently. It's such a shame that it had to turn out this way. 
So overall, I enjoyed the show but definitely can't call it a must-watch like many others have said. It's quite mediocre, although yes it does have a pretty good time-loop mechanism for the plot and I guess it has some romance. There are also some really good action scenes dispersed throughout the show that might be worth getting to if you can handle hours of Subaru cringe, so I that makes the show ""sorta good""

You know, honestly, I'm not sure why Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid (TSR for short) is not ranked with a higher score than it currently has.  This show surpasses every aspect of Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, which you should be watching first for the sake of chronological order.  Like any sequel in a series, people expect the next one to deliver more than the previous, and deliver TSR has.  Even though the prequel, Fumoffu, is a great comedy between the main characters, Sousuke and Kaname, TSR does not follow suit.  Instead, think of the first series, but much better overall. 
First off, the story is great.  For a thirteen episode series, TSR packs a lot of plot into it.  The story is continuously interesting from the very first opening scene to the last ending scene.  Again, although TSR carries a lot of it's predecessors' traits into this series, it is quite apparent from the first couple of minutes into the show that this storyline is darker than what fans may be used to.  But, don't let this deter you because it sets a serious tone which attracts your attention throughout the entire thirteen episodes.  It's not like TSR doesn't have any comedy in it, it's just that they use it more sparingly than the previous two series.  All in all though, TSR storyline is a roller coaster of emotions, which will not disappoint anyone, as it is simply fantastic. 
What can I say about the art?  It's very good.  Again, compared to the other two series, the animation in TSR is a huge step up.  The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, and the lighting effects used in this series are awesome.  The colors are sharp and crisp, and the animation is smooth beyond belief.  Just by watching even the smallest movement in the characters, you can see the effort that was put into TSR.  This over-the-top quality animation is very apparent during the mech battles, which look just fantastic.  There are only a couple of brief instances where the animation suffers a little, but it definitely does not take anything away from the series. 
The music and sounds in TSR are also great.  The song artist from the first two series returns, and she does not disappoint with the opening and ending themes.  Like the other openings and endings in the Full Metal Panic! series, the songs fit the tone of TSR perfectly.  The background music is great as well, as it really sets the right atmosphere depicted by the story. As for the sound effects, they are as realistic as can be, and some of them were quite unique in my opinion. 
Ah yes, the characters.  I must say that I simply love watching the characters interact with each other in the Full Metal Panic! series.  From the minor characters to the major ones, TSR will not disappoint in this department.  I kid you not; the character development in TSR is truly outstanding.  Watching the relationship between Sousuke and Kaname in this series alone has personally made them my favorite anime couple.  I definitely thought it was the most attracting part about the show, as you can really feel what they are thinking and what they are going through.  This is why you need to see the other two series before this one.  Watching these characters grow and develop in TSR gives you a roller coaster ride of emotions, and it is just fantastic. 
Well, finally, the enjoyment factor.  To sum it up in three words: I love it.  This is how an anime should be done in every aspect.  The episodes in TSR were consistently very good, and it basically improved on everything that made Full Metal Panic! good in the first place, and turned it into something outstanding.  By the way, I am not a critic who gives out an overall score of ten very easily.  In fact, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid and only one other anime have received an overall score of ten from me.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  Just give it a try for yourself.

The reason Hero Mask failed to live up to the expectations is because It throughs you right in the action without introducing any of the characters . 
From the begginning of the show you are unable to feel empathy towards any of them because barely anything about them is revealed.  
The plot starts directly from episode one with (not really a spoiler) the death of a woman which seems to  ''have been'' an important part of the cast. All of the characters troughout the show say that she was really important to them without saying why or revealing anything about her past. 
So the show just fails to make you invested in It.

At a glance, I thought Golden Boy was the quintessential shounen anime; and the apparent immature innuendos, big-breasted females, and set of characters (a perverted young man and many attractive women surrounding him) served to emphasize that. However, overlooking said cliches, I found Golden Boy to be entertaining and fun throughout. 
Story: A young man named Kintaro Oe, having completed university, goes around Japan learning about the world, particularly attractive women, while also having many life experiences. In each episode, Kintaro stops by a random city in Japan and applies for a job in each place. His unofficial mission is to learn about and help the people he meets, particularly the attractive women he encounters. Unfortunately, despite the unique premise, there is nothing else to the story. Every single episode follows the same formula. While this is a weakness, the quality of each episode compensates for the weak story, as every one of Kintaro's adventures is thoroughly entertaining. Another turn-off for some is the lack of originality; who hasn't seen a perverted guy interacting with voluptuous women falling for him before? The most notable flaw is the length; after just - episodes, you will certainly crave for more (provided you like the anime). Rating: -/-- 
Art: The animation is good throughout Golden Boy. I have a bias towards the old-style animation, but surely others will find it pleasing to the eye. All the characters look decent with very few rough edges. As for the background art, it's adequate; there's not much to say. Sometimes the animation can look distorted or lazily-done, but this is rare and hard to notice. Rating: -/-- 
Sound: I can't say much about the music; it's just average for the most part, save for a few tracks. Overall, the music is certainly not terrible in any way. As for the voice acting, it's a mixed bag. I haven't watched the subbed version yet (which I am sure is great), but the dubbed version bounces between good and sub-par. Kintaro's voice sounds odd and jittery, and the blonde in the first episode has an average voice at best. All the other voices are adequate. Personally, I thought Kintaro's voice, while unnatural, was hilarious; it perfectly suited his odd behavior. Some of his lines are great, too, such as his oft-repeated one, ""Study!"" His voice's amusing effect is probably unintentional, but it nevertheless adds to Golden Boy's humor. Rating: -/-- 
Characters: Most of the characters are average, save Kintaro's. Kintaro's character is altogether entertaining; his odd behavior and perverted side are certainly Golden Boy's main source of humor. Unfortunately, besides that, his character is not unique as countless characters are similar to his. However, while Golden Boy is far from serious, Kintaro's character is three-dimensional to an extent; despite being a horny pervert, he has a sense of honor that he maintains throughout the show, as he is given countless opportunities to score with an attractive female, but turns them down so as to keep his goal clear: to help the people he meet. While this kind of character has also been done to death, it makes Golden Boy even better given its comedic nature. Rating: -/-- 
Golden Boy is, despite its flaws, a thoroughly-entertaining series. I recommend this to fans of comedy and ecchi, as it oozes with innuendo and jokes (and a combination of both). If you don't like an overload of innuendo and an unoriginal plot, however, steer clear.

Ok guys, I decided to write the review for this after the series ended, and oh boy did this deliver. Actually all the anime of winter ---- were something special, if you are reading this few years down the line and haven't seen them, please consider watching season, it has something for everyone.   
This story is about - different girls, from - very different lives who all seem to be broken somewhat. A girl who lost her mother in a previous expedition, a bored goof, a high school dropout and a famous lonely idol. They all go to Antarctica to escape their usual lives and potentially be healed by the harsh cold.  
What happens is that the - slowly become inseparable friends in tear jerking fashion, with comedy and more serious and heavy scenes, and overcome their past issues whilst moving forwards towards a brighter future. 
There was no romanticisation of Antarctica, the most heavy topic being Shirase's mother dying in a freak blizzard, how difficult it is to get funding to go in the first place, the intense harsh training needed for to toughen your body up, safety drills, trust in teamwork, communication with each other, the harsh cold etc.  
The final two episodes are amazing, one for how emotional they are (yes, you probably will shed a tear) and also how they all move on. 
--/-- solid story, in my opinion it will become a must watch for the modern era of anime

Honestly I dont know how this anime got above a -. It may have been one of my least favorite isekai genre of animes. The fighting scenes and animations were sub par, the sound effects were not satisfying, the characters were kind of boring, the voices of most characters were annoying, the anime kept using cliche anime scenes like pushing up glasses with a glare and sound effect, there was nothing special about the animation, in fact I thought the animation was a little worse than other animes, and the ideology behind the character motives and thinking are childish. I feel like this anime is a vastly inferior SAO. This also applies to the second season.

As much of a ""classic"" or ""must-watch"" anime as this may be, its only strengths are the same as a generic explosion film. There isn't a story to this anime, at least not one that I could follow. It appears to have a rebellion type plot with some sci-fi mixed in, but I couldn't pinpoint where the beginning, middle, and end were. This is ""adapted"" from a highly acclaimed manga and was even directed by the mangaka himself so the poor adaptation may be due how little time it had to adapt what was released of the manga at the time. 
The action scenes are done well and the colour palette is impressive seeing as what was available at the time the movie was made. Unfortunately all of the characters look similar and in a fast paced movie it can be hard to know what characters are in a scene without other characters referring to them by name. Since the movie is action based the characters don't address each other too often so you may watch through an entire scene without even knowing which characters were in it. 
The sound effects were done well and sound quite realistic when they need to be. The music also sets the tone of the scenes well. The voice actors do a much better job than the character designer and the characters do sound different. Their voices also sound good in general and make the movie come alive more than anything else does. If you have a good knowledge of seiyuu you should be able to tell the characters apart by voices. 
In addition to not being drawn differently, the characters also don't differ too much in their personalities. The antagonist was completely forgettable, the protagonists form a group consciousness which makes it hard to follow which character did what, and the female characters look and act so similar to the male characters that it can be hard to even know that they're female to begin with. One character they designed differently from the rest was some sort of alien, but he also has a female counterpart who is indistinguishable from what he would look like in drag. 
I personally couldn't find anything to enjoy about this anime. The battles were nice, but if that's all you're there for then the sad attempt at trying to give the movie some sort of plot could just be classified as filler. The story feels like a dementia anime but lacks the satisfaction of understanding it almost like a maze with an entrance and no exit. 
There isn't much to this anime at all. The sound is good and the sakuga is nice to look at, but from a storytelling standpoint there isn't anything of any value.

Very nice movie and very entertaining. Even if it lasts for almost - hours you get in love with the characters very quickly. This anime shows us a little tiny bit of the future that we are going to live in, a future where everything is based on technology, but tells us not to always rely on it. We have to respect the old traditions and keep family close, respect our elders and to keep in mind their advices.

I had already watched the Hellsing TV version and really enjoyed the story, so I was thrilled when I found out there was a Hellsing ""Ultimate"" OVA. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I found that the OVA contained some amazing moments and I certainly like that there was more blood and adult content, but overall I found it played out like a cheesy, over-the-top vampire opera and found myself fast-forwarding through episodes. 
Here is an interesting comparison: some people prefer the movie Aliens over the original Alien. Alien had more style and left more to the imagination -- it was more about psychological terror. Aliens was more of an action flick with aliens getting blasted and popping out of walls and ceilings left and right. Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate are similar. Hellsing was a bit reserved, with more style, and skillfully climaxing with the moment when the vampire Alucard reveals the true extent of his power and hints at his true identity. Hellsing Ultimate is a wild ride that shows Alucard at nearly his maximum power in episode - and things get crazier from there. More blood, more rape, more cursing, villains who rant and rave for what seems like -- solid minutes, impossibly esoteric special powers, and special powers that vastly exceed the aforementioned special powers. 
I won't go into more detail that that in order to avoid spoilers. Most people seem to prefer Ultimate, but I for one appreciate the more subtle approach taken by the Hellsing series. My overall enjoyment of the series only warrants a - out of --.

!WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AND IS VERY BIASED! 
Tl;dr: If you are like me, and you hate harems and love watching anime's with romance, then i DO NOT suggest watching classroom crisis. 
The story was not all that interesting, basically, they were sprouting out a bunch of weird politics they just made up for the purpose of this anime.  
The sound and art was more than decent, almost the only part that was good..... 
The characters...some of the characters seemed like robots, for example, a group a people just quit the team, but then they came back because they just wanted to see how the team leader would do.....i don't know if that makes sense or not, but basically only the main characters had a little development, the rest were just there for props. 
NOW!!!!!  
The main point that upset me SO MUCH to give it such a low score: THE ROMANCE 
The romance was a complete JOKE! i would've gave this anime a decent score, but then the ending made this anime completely appalling. They had a  good romance going, and the way it developed was good. But then the other girl regained her memory, and now the anime has become a harem. The man male has - girls all wanting him, and the anime just plays it off as a joke. 
I felt like i was deceived into watching it just to get the ending i most hated.  
Everything in my review is based on my own opinion. Everyone has different opinions, and mine on this anime is not good. 
I do not expect everyone to agree. Some people like it, some people don't. And to be honest, I would've given this anime a --- if it weren't for the ending. 
I wrote this so to share what i feel about this anime.

This anime is starts as one of the worst attempts at pandering to mmo crowd I've ever seen, but slowly manages to pull itself together and provide something somewhat original and interesting in the end. In the end it is a mix of good and bad. At the ""bad"" side there are numerous cringe-worthy poorly moments where the game tried to throw MMO slang around or (even worse) explain it. At the ""good"" side... we have numerous story moments where the anime drops obsession with MMO thing, and starts focusing on the story and characters. In the end both sides sorta cancel each other out, and result is somewhere in the middle. I would say it is slightly better than first season of Overlord, all things considered. 
Detailed breakdown below: 
Story: -/--: 
First episodes are horrible. First means somewhere between - and - of the first episodes. The anime makes a point of throwing around terminology related to online games and at the same time it wastes many many many scenes explaining MMO mechanics. It is cringeworthy and silly. The only reason why I pulled through those beginning episodes is one of the likeable secondary characters, which made the whole thing interesting. However, past certain point it stops trying to explain everything, and tunes down the number of MMO slang thrown around, and concentrates on unique aspects of the world ... it becomes much more interesting. At the same time the anime introduces a very likeable and very well done secondary character that saves the day. That helps as well. 
Expect ton of MMO reference and slang fan-service from the story. 
Art: -/--: 
Honestly, nothing to write home about. The anime uses plenty of adult-proportioned characters, which is good, but it uses that style where linework is often abbreviated, and level of details is somewhat low, which is a bit disappointing. Backgrounds are well done, but I wish characters had more details. Still, there are a lot of large scenes with a lot of people, prerhaps that was the reason for slightly simpler art style. Either way, the visuals didn't make me go wow. 
Sound: -/--: 
The music its job, pretty much, and there's little to tell about it. Most of the voice actors are okay, however, sider heroines I mentioned stood out as being more convincing. 
Character: -/--: 
Now, here we have a split and mix of good and bad. Majority of characters in the anime are quite bland. They're either ""carton cutouts"", or highly stereotypical. Which is not a good thing. For example, after completing the season I have very little to say about protagonist's character. 
However, there are two side characters that are of significantly higher quality, compared to everybody else. The first one is Akatsuki, and the second one is certain Princess. The princess is absolutely adorable to watch, and pretty much saves the day, in terms of quality. Her performance outshines most of the other characters, and she is both more believable and more interesting. 
Enjoyment: -/--: 
It was mostly okay. I could barely tolerate first episodes, but later found some fun watching scenes related to akatsuki and the princess. Those redeemed this anime for me. 
Bottom Line: -/--: 
It is a mix of good and bad. The anime wastes too much time trying to appeal to MMO crowd, and for someone who isn't into the genre this can be annoying. Same applies to situations where MMO mechanics are being explained. 
However. in the middle of the season there are more interesting developments in the world, and there are two very well done characters which pretty much save the show in the end. 
So.... my advice is: it may be worth checking out, but non-MMO people can find pandering to MMO players in the first episodes to eb both annoying and distracting. The show gets much better in the middle, and have two very amusing/amazing characters, which are pretty much the primary reason for watching it till the end. 
So, it is worth checking out - mostly because of those two well done characters I mentioned, and because of unique setting explanation.... - but I wouldn't call it a ""must have"" kind of anime.

Disclaimer : This is the first time I’m writing a review, so I do apologized if there’s any mistake. Also please be kind if there’s any ideas that I put here, badly written or explained. I would also like to say that my English is not perfect, so sorry if there’s any grammar mistakes and what not. I’ve also only seen about -- anime so far, but I want to write an anime about this because of it’s perfection in my eyes. I will also write this review, in a subjective form of manner, which is seen and written under my point of view. 
There might also be minor spoiler in the review too. 
Now for the meat of the review..  
When I first saw the movie, I thought that it would be an ordinary of a girl whisked away in a dark fantasy world, trying to get out from it. Well, that was honestly my intital thought of it, we heard that story many times before both in horror-like setting or a fantasy one in almost every kind of entertainment medium. However , “Spirited away” got some feeling that is something different to me. There isn’t any epic battles, nor dramatic love scenes.. Instead, it’s put in a way of a young girl’s dreamlike-sequence. (Something like what you would dream when you were really young) with a lot of imagination coming into place. Instead of expecting something huge happening like in other anime, I recommend you to just sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching this dreamlike-world that have been crafted by the creators because It’s something really special in my eyes (and heart). 
Firstly, the art in the anime, is of course AMAZING! The colours and asthetics feel up the world in like something that a kid would dream off in her imagination. The lights were amazing, the pig looked amazing… everything about the movie was amazing. Honestly, it’s one of the few supernatural  drama-like movie that I will rewatched, seeing I’ve never really like drama-ish type of movies anyway. 
The chracters, oh how I love each and every one of them. In the start, I was thinking that Haku would betray the little girl..I kept on thinking to myself  
“Oh noo… I know where this is heading…Please don’t let it happen like in other medias..” (Judging from other movies and other form of entertainment media).  Then I thought the Yubaba was the antagonist of the movie. I was glad I was wrong.. None of them are the antagonist. It’s really just about each and everyone in the dream-like world trying to live their life.  
In the start, when Chihiro was brought to the sprit world, you can see that she was suffering, scared as she was brought on to a new world where she don’t know anyone.. As we see through her journey of hardship, you can see her going through that hardship as we have this sense of hope that she would suceed ( I mean, who don’t want to see a cute adorable to do so am I right?? ) with her sense of bravery and courage to bring her parents back to human again and return to the human world. It felt really humanly possible, a sense of connection to the world we live in as it fills up with a child-like dream that we would want to explore at any given time. 
In short, This is the type of flim that we can feel vulnerable about, yet feel that sense of awe with the world by how creative and beautiful the world that have been crafted to us. It’s a masterpiece, that I would like to re-watch again after a given time. A trip where I can feel young and human again after a long while in work or university. It’s memorable, it looks beautiful even at the year ---- (seeing it came out at ----) It can make you feel like you’re a child again with a huge smile again after watching this movie. It made me smile, and I hope whoever watches this for the first time, will feel so just like me. Enjoy the anime movie guys ! 

A pretty decent movie with a decent concept. it started like this: - different worlds that are equally deluded on the way of life. but the characters in each world wants to discover something more then what they live in, and hence this story. Sadly the MC ruined it for me. Patema is the exact type of character i hate in my animes: she acts like shes so important and does what she likes, and when she gets into trouble, doesnt know shit on how to handle herself and orders people to help her. hated her by the --th min of the movie. but if you like this kind of character ( a useless spoilt brat, but some people find that cute) then go ahead. this movie is alright since the art and music are good. but with a somewhat similar concept I rather recommend other movies like The Giver (not anime but really good) or No.-, or even Blame! (personal opinion. you dont have to agree)

One of the cringiest anime to exist. I watched three episodes because i thought as it went on it would get a little better, but it did not. The MC boy has a past of this non sense and decides that in high school he will be a normal student. But then a girl who lives above him gets into his life. THIS is the part that gets me... All he had to do was stay away from here, and when the teacher first asked him to take her home he could have simply said no, like most people would. He continues to do this, and he says to himself and to her to stay away from him but he eventually breaks. Very very annoying MC girl who is crazy.

Dragons, fantasy and ferocious creatures known for their majesty and destructive power, unequaled beasts that only fit in the power of imagination, but now, with a very sexy human body ... and a loli. Of course who would say that this is possible, but there are - things in the world that are able to return the most human dragons successfully, the anime and Skyrim. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is an excellent anime to spend the afternoons with laughter and a happy atmosphere, after all, the world is already too dark, why not laugh a little with more colorful creatures? The interesting thing about this series is that it is able to entertain without having to go to ecchi, despite being full of fan service, the main character is female and his '' harem '' is also female, even so the characters manage to have a very excellent connection with each other and be able to demonstrate complete charisma and attract the attention of the public for feeling the need to have more quality time with them; the story is simple but it fulfills its function, entertain us positively, in addition, the animation is quite amazing and the jokes are very well done, I must say that I enjoy watching this anime.

Initial D is like Captain Tsubasa or Kuroko no Basuke, you can enjoy it only if you're that kind of people who never cares about it's correlation with real-life logics and realisms.  
And also the reason why it became so popular is because there are literally almost no other anime that revolves around cars. (I don't know any other anime about cars except Initial D and Wangan Midnight) 
So why is Initial D is so pathetic? 
-. Takumi had been drifting his Toyota -- since - years before the first episode, yet he knew nothing about his own car? 
-. Takumi had been drifting his Toyota -- since - years before the first episode, yet he was still so shocked and scared the first time (on the passanger seat) he go on a touge drift with Ikitani like it's his first experience? 
-. Takumi's dad is just selling tofu, yet his son burned more money on tyres and fuel much more than the profit from selling tofu. So where are these money came from actually? 
-. Driving fast and drifting is actually going to the opposite direction. There's actually reasons why no one gone drifting while chasing faster time records up into the Pikes Peak. And slides (drift) in WRC are mostly happens in acute corners and chicanes in a dirt track, you can almost never saw any slides if it's on tarmac/asplhalt 
-. As far as I know, you can drift faster (and longer) only if you have bigger engine (more torque, more power for the spin), so if the Toyota -- was left far behind by the RX- in a straight line, it's safe to say that the -- have no engine upgrades (suspension upgrades won't be any different since everybody knows both cars are on drift setups), the -- would literally have zero chance to reduce the gap in the corners especially by doing drifts, so that's just plain BS. 
-. Drifting faster by using the roadside ditch as a rail for a front tyre is also logical af. 
I only watched it until episode - and can't take the bullshite any longer. 
Arts are pretty good (edit: it's pretty great) considering the year it was made, soundtrack is pretty good but the theme song is not that kind of music that I like.

Despite the bad score I gave this show, I don't think it's completely irredeemable. I actually really enjoyed some episodes individually, but as an overall experience though from start to finish I'm not sure I can recommend it.  
The first thing we see in episode - is a gothic castle, shrouded in mist that really sets a creepy, atmospheric tone that I found pretty enchanting. By the -rd episode the tone completely shifts and we're getting cutesy arguments between the tsundere main vampire girl, Hazuki, and Kouhei, her unlikely rescuer. It's actually hard to believe it's even the same show at that point, and the series continues to flip-flop between these two tones. The episodes vary greatly: comedy, drama, slice-of-life, romance, and action.  
The plot of the show tends to come to a stand-still when the show is tackling more lighthearted themes, but I think these are actually probably the best episodes. These are the episodes where we see Hazuki and Kouhei develop as characters the most, and they were the ones I found myself the most emotionally invested in. The side characters are mostly good too, with Hazuki's guardian spirit, Haiji, stealing the show (though I'm sure some people will find her extremely annoying). None of the side-characters are ever developed very much though, unfortunately, and because of that I found myself massively preferring the episodes that centered on Hazuki and Kouhei.  
The ""plot"" episodes tend to be more focused on action and are... not so good. There is very little explanation of how magic works in this universe, so the viewer is mostly left in the dark on what the hell is actually happening in any given fight scene. The show also has some problems with consistency. Characters randomly gain and lose abilities, and rules that are made early on for combat are later broken. The story is pretty nonsensical in general though, certain plot elements are never explained properly, and it was hard for me to get invested in it.  
As far as romance goes, there is VERY little. Hazuki and Kouhei mostly have an older brother/younger sister type relationship. Though they do toe the line on a couple instances. It's a bit awkward since Kouhei is older and Hazuki is like --.  
The comedy is hit-or-miss. There are a couple of pretty funny moments, but it massively overuses random objects (usually wash-bins) falling on characters heads.  
The worst part of this show is after episode --/-- though. The last - episodes are extremely bad. Characters make decisions that border on nonsensical, villains randomly appear and then disappear, and there is a whole lot of extremely forced drama. The ending is extremely unsatisfying and leaves massive plot holes and unanswered questions. There are also none of the lighthearted episodes we previously saw in the series in this last batch. I actually wish I had skipped these ones because they left a bad taste in my mouth about the series overall.  
The art is pretty okay for an anime from this time period, and I massively prefer the art-style of the anime to the manga. The music is actually pretty great. It's suitably creepy when the atmosphere demands it, and whimsical when something comedic is happening. The opening, ""Nekomimi Mode,"" will probably be hit-or-miss for most people.  I personally don't like it but it is extremely memorable at the very least.  
Overall, it's an OK show, but I'm not sure I can recommend it. If you do watch it, I strongly advise you don't watch the last --ish episodes, due to the severe drop in quality.

Here is my review for Steins;Gate. I will keep it as simple as possible. 
ART - - point 
Man the character designs are terrible. I understand the art style and what’s coming to me from watching S;G, but except for Okabe, the rest of the cast could be better-looking. No offense to anyone, but Mayuri looks like she has down syndrome with that hat and face LOL. Kurisu white as a ghost and I don’t find that hot.  
Sound - - point 
Alright the opening and ending song were pretty good. I would definitely suggest listening to them even if the show was bad. 
Story - - point 
Here’s what hit S;G hard. First half of the series wasted so much time. There was like - eps wasted to find the IBN comp, whole lotta useless talk added. Very boring ! Just when I thought I got to the -nd half of the series and it’s gonna become thrilling, I find PLOTHOLES that ruins the story and I will explain. 
********SPOILER******** 
It turns out Moeka was working for Sern. But why would Okabe give some random stranger Moeka that threatened him by taking his picture, private contact info in the first place??? and even invite her to club. I wouldn't give a stranger who stopped me in the street anything. Okabe let the wolf in by opening the door. It was really dumb. 
First time, Sern breaks in, Mayuri was shot dead, Okabe was captured. Why didn't SERN confiscate all the equipment at that point right at the site? Sern was interested in what Okabe has uncovered anyways, hence he was not shot dead like Mayuri. So okkk....., I assume Okabe sucessfully turns back time the FIRST time after escaping. At that point, Okabe tries to change Mayuri's fate, Okabe runs around, SERN really should have the brain to destroy or confiscate the lab while they trying to capture Okabe. In addition, Okabe out on the streets, he's running. SERN got cars, how did he outrun Sern back to the lab. Even by foot, giving chase, Sern can always corner Okabe. Okabe is helpless without the lab. This is a GIANT PLOTHOLE because if Okabe remained captured, there wouldn't even be a continuation of the story you know of, or it would just be end of story. 
Character - - point 
Characters were all terrible. I will explain that too. *Minor Spoiler Alert 
Okabe - Big arrogant, smartass, (sometimes funny, but limited)  
Mayuri - Do do do!!! is she - years old, retarded?  
Ruka - WTH? Yes i Clearly understand her gender changes after the D-Mail incident! But first of all, if her gender change, why does she ""LOOK"" the same, I would really appreciate it if there were some minor look differences seriously. That's not all, Why were Okabe and the Computer Geek ""Turned on"" when Ruka was cosplaying wearing a dress when She was a MALE at that time??? That's Disgusting!!!  
Kurisu - Stop acting like a tsundere to every single little thing.  
Daru (Computer Geek) - nonstop, overused lame hentai jokes not even funny anymore.  
Moeka - Can you talk? Stop texting even when you right in front of Okabe soooo annoying. Also stop taking pictures, that's really annoying doing that without consent, I woulda tossed her ass out if that’s Real life.  
Feyris - IS that HOW you TALK? I can understand you talk all MOE in the cafe, I can understand! But outside her job, she Talk all Nyan Nyan, wTfff? LMAO Am i supposed to think ya cute ?  
Suzuha – Although I can understand why, she feels too hostile to be liked. 
Enjoyment - - point 
I do not understand how S;G was entertaining. I really tried liking it, but couldn't. First half was slowww and too boring, second half was expecting mindfckk, but got none of that. I didn't even care for Mayuri, so honestly I felt nothing when she died LOOOL. 
My final score for S;G would unfortunately have to be a -, it wasn’t epic or enjoyable. Even if the last few episodes of S;G were good, a few ""good"" episodes can't save the show. For TRUE Epicness, and Brilliance, I recommend heading on to Death Note xD

The theme song is killer, the art includes rich colors, and each character is very unique in their own way. Very interesting story, but I wish that it could have been lengthened so that we could have more character development. Decim is my personal favorite since his stoic and socially awkward personality along with his dashingly good looks makes me blush, but the ending is also very heartbreaking and causes viewers (such as I) to cry alongside with the show. I loved other characters, such as Nona and Clavis, but they don't have any noteworthy personality traits that make me remember them as well as I wish I did. I do wish that the show could have been a bit longer, despite my high rating of Death Parade. --/-- would watch again.

I wanted to love it but I ended up hating it. Where does one begin when they want to talk about something that fills them with a complete contradiction? The answer is I don't really know. 
So, as a means to start this review I'll get the informal non-explanatory part out of the way: 
I am extremely pissed off. Never have I been so god damn irritated at a show in almost its entirety. 
And, as someone who is a bit of a sucker for a good romance, why am I so aggrieved at something which many consider a masterpiece in the genre? The simplest answer I can give is that from my perspective, the strengths of this show also happen to be its downfall. 
First ask yourself the question - what is the main strength of this show? For those who haven't seen it and don't know the answer, it's realism. It makes an attempt at portraying an extremely real-life scenario: no fan service, no dumb scenes spoiled for comedic effect, no obvious archetypes. Just a bunch of awkward teenagers being awkward teenagers and struggling to deal with lovey-dovey feelings. 
I don't know about you but I would consider this a plus, and to be fair most of the cast are brilliantly done in this regard. My issue however lies with the two main characters of the show - Kotarou and Akane. 
I'll be frank: never do these two display any sort of chemistry and it never feels like they're in a relationship until it's far too late to matter. Both characters display elements of realism that make sense but let's be real here: Kotarou asks Akane out on a whim despite not knowing very much about her because he fancies her and she says yes because she clearly fancies him as well. But they spend the entire time being awkward - they don't tell anyone, they hardly speak in each other's physical presence and no one really realises because the way they act they might as well not even be in a relationship. If half the characters in the show can't tell, how am I supposed to believe that they're really together? 
I'd probably describe it as realism gone too far. The reason most shows are not portrayed in complete realism is because if they were they would be boring - no one wants to watch the monotony of everyday people. This is essentially how I feel - the majority of their interactions together are dull and I struggle to root for their romance when it never feels like they belong together. I guess the -.-- average rating at the time of writing is testament against this but it's a mostly true statement (about why shows aren't portrayed with ultra realism) and I'm simply writing how I feel. There are certainly those who think otherwise. 
I mean you know, I want them to be awkward but romantically awkward. I want them to spend all their time together and actually acknowledge each other around other human beings, not blatantly ignore each other until they're completely alone. Just personal idealism I suppose, but nonetheless representative of why it annoyed me. I want romance from my romance, not awkward nonsense with forced tearjerker moments to try and make me feel like they're being romantic. 
It also meant that the tearjerkers towards the end didn't pack the punch they should've done. I really, really wanted to get into them but I couldn't because of the aforementioned reasons. Sitting through it I felt as if I was wasting my time. 
All in all, I don't particularly feel like the show is bad. I've given it a - after all not a -. I just came out of it highly unsatisfied and wishing what could have been, thinking about how I would have loved those tearjerkers had I gotten into the characters. 
Fair play to everyone who enjoyed it though. Everyone has their own opinions after all and I don't want to take issue with them. Just because I didn't love it doesn't mean others won't.  
Try not to feel put off by anything I've said - if you're interested, give it a go. At the end of the day, it stands about above a lot of the crap considered ""romance anime"". I'm just here to offer a slightly different perspective from the majority for anyone who might be interested. Feel free to disagree and/or discuss anything I've written about with me. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a nice day.

*THIS REVIEW WILL REFER TO BOTH SEASONS* 
Fate/Zero is one of the best anime I have ever watched! It does a brilliant job in each and every aspect and it has so much going on for it that I could recommend it to almost anyone! 
The setting is the same as in it's sequel- Fate/Stay Night; Seven mages (the masters) summon themselves a servant of one out of seven classes. once all are summoned, starts a seven on seven tag team battle royale where the winning pair wins the holy grail, an omnipotent object that can grant any wish to both the master and their servant. 
The concept  is great overall, but the one thing that makes it SO MUCH BETTER then any Fate/Stay Night adaptation is the characters. Unlike the bland, annoying characters from Fate/Stay Night, the characters in Fate/Zero have a lot more depth to them. Each character has a different ideology, different motivations and a different interaction with their partner which make the entire situation much more realistic. All characters are good and relatable and it's really hard to point out a bad guy at times. 
The story is very character driven and no character has any plot armor. It's almost impossible to predict anything in this series, since any character may do anything (including dying) at any given moment and you find yourself sitting tight on your chair not knowing what to expect, mindlessly watching episode after episode. 
The only weaker parts are the beginning and the end. Since this anime also targeted people who didn't watch Fate/Stay Night, the first episode is a -- minute long boring exposition that feels more like a documentary. But even though the anime also targeted people who didn't watch Fate/Stay Night, it still had to live up to it's pre-existing sequel, resulting in a pretty anticlimactic ending that doesn't make much sense. 
Nevertheless, I really enjoyed watching it. The characters and story are amazing and as for the slow start and the anticlimactic ending, I can look the other way. 
The animation is absolutely beautiful. The quality is nearly cinematic with beautiful character design and special effects. You can see animation of that quality in many other anime, but only in recently released anime and even then, not consistently in each frame like in Fate/Zero. 
The soundtrack was composed mostly by Yuki Kajiura. Enough said. 
The music in this show is perfect for it, portraying the overall vibe of the show very well and adding to it, creating a lot of suspense in any given moment, whether it's an epic battle or a simple conversation. 
The voice actors (in both the original Japanese and the English dub, mind you) all did a wonderful job and they all fit their characters very well. 
I highly recommend you watch this anime, because I believe that anyone can find something to like about it. The beginning might be slow and the ending might be weird, but these are just two episodes and this anime is too good to ignore because of them.

This review like series of paragraphs does contain minor spoilers as to certain couples and implies the endings of certain archs so gonna point that out now  
So Sakuraso was an anime that i at first at least had very high hopes for. This anime took a very good topic which i found to be not explored nearly enough and decided to make an anime about it. This topic was one very close to me in my personal life and it was that of inferiority complex. I find this to be a brilliant topic that needs exploration. Then in the first - episodes it does just that, it has the main character accept the fact that he wanted her to fail but then realize that in the end it was her hard work that allowed her to prevail and in reality he just has to keep working harder. Now that's fantastic i love that and then you realize, wait this anime has like -- more episodes to go. And so we continue the story of how every character INCLUDING the main character keep on suffering this inferiority complex. Well not EVERY chacacters problem is inferiority complex but most of them are and really it just confuses me, why have the same thing over and over again like after he deals with it once why does the same thing keep happening it baffles me. Hell this even happens to Jin and Jin was the one who mentored him through it. Now the second kind of topic of this anime is overcoming defeat. This is handled even worse than before because it is the same cycle over and over and over and over IT NEVER ENDS they just keep on failing and i keep on asking myself will it ever be over but no in the end it just keeps going. 
I guess i should talk about the characters. Well not much to say here Mashiro is kinda a very boring character if i can even call her a character... shes like a dog without her own kind of story she is just there for everyone elses story and for all of them to feel inferior same with misaki she just server the purpose of having Jin feel inferior to her. There is a romancish plot with them which is kind of boring but it does give Misaki some character so i guess thats fine. Some other characters like Rita exist although she is just there to also feel inferior because we simply didnt have enough of that. Ryūnosuke is there i guesssss as a tsundere. Really i have no idea what his place is in the story and i find him to be very unnecassary and just there as a guy for a shoe horned in romance plot between him a Rita and also as a character to move the plot along since he gives Sorata the incentive to start his video game making project. Lastly we have Nanami who is there for the aforementioned topic of overcoming failure and really she just fails so much and she just keeps failing i mean my good lord Nanami and Sorata just fail so much in this anime and they just repeat the process of overcoming it over and over, i find it terribly boring and also at some point i felt like they could give these characters a break. I mean sure it is realistic that someone could fail that much but this is an anime after all and it's less that i feel bad and more that i feel that there is very little progression going on with that whole plot of them failing since there is never any success and so it ends up being repetitive and unnecessary.    
Now that we have the characters rounded up i can talk about the romance plots because i feel these deserve a special looking at as being separate from the main plots since they do not fit in with any main theme of the anime. Therefor i want to assess them independently. These are very lame to watch starting of with the one between the two main characters. This just feels boring considering how boring of a character Mashiro is. Like i said before she doesn't really have any problems that needs resolution so she ends up being very static and so her romance ends up being as standard and boring as any other where you  have her slowly realizing her feeling until the long a-waited for payoff offffffffffff... a kiss on the cheek ... a manga about crossdresser's had the main couple have sex like -- chapters in im sorry a kiss on the cheek aint gonna cut it honey. But in all seriousness this would have been fine had the anime been simply a cutesy romance but in the end the anime does try to bring in bigger more important themes and therefor there is no time for the romance to actually develop between the two and so it just ends up being very boring to watch. Then we have Jin and Misaki. Similar problem but in this case Misaki at least has the problem of that she is already in love with Jin and can't see why he wont date her which gives her a problem to deal with, or so you would think but once again this problem does not rely on Misaki taking action but rather Jin coming to terms with his feeling of being too inferior to her which he already told everyone how to overcome in the -rth episode... i guess he forgot. But i will say it is a tad better than the romance between the leads because it does give Misaki more of a character since she clearly has problems she to cannot deal with. As well, on a side notel it seems very stupid that he would reject her for him not being good enough i dont know may be just me but if you love a girl and they love you back like what does not being a good writer have anything to do with anything ugh well whatever next we have Ryūnosuke and Rita. Next we have Nanami who is the other love intrest to Sorata. This goes nowhere 
As well i don't really feel the need but i guess i should talk about the music and art. THe tracks are mostly fine with the opening being pretty stupidly catchy i didnt find any problems its your standard fair but i also didn't find anthing amazing. I dont find a need to comment on the art of an anime like this since it's art just has to present cutesy characters and cutesy scenes and it does that although it does get nice when they get to the serious scenes the art did actually surprise as to how good it was but other than that not much to say.  
In the end i enjoyed the first - episodes and then got bored watching the same thing over and over. Also there that whole thing about the building being torn down that had nothing to do with the main themes of the anime and I guess it was to show that umm errr their bonds are so fragile that by not living together they would stop being friends... i don't know it was just kinda put in there so that the anime could end. I guess someone finally told them they should end soon rather than just write the same plot in different scenario's over and over. 
Ya i gave this anime a - equal to the amount of episodes i enjoyed.

Naruto is really typical, it seems like one of those infamous series you hear about all the time, so you tend to watch it to satisfy your own curiosity.  It's not as bad as some people claim, yet I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever watched. 
Story: Here's the thing with the story of Naruto, it's really a good plot, it is, minus the fillers that is.  Once the fillers kick in, the whole enjoyment aspect of it just fully decreases.  I'm rating the story aspect of it based on the story itself, not the fillers, hence why I said it was very good.  The rating for this anime would really improve if they did it in seasons.  Sure, the thought of waiting months for the next arc is a bit frustrating, but at least the fans would get something worth watching. 
Art: Nothing really to say about art, it's really typical so I wouldn't say it stands out.   
Sound: Most of the opening and closing seem to fit appropriately with the genre of the anime, same goes for the background music used in the anime.  Character's voice all fit nicely with their respectively characters, which helps to bring out their unique personality. 
Characters: The characters themselves are average, like most series, they all tend to wear the same clothes all the time, probably to better acquaint you with them.  What I'd like to comment about is the use of skills, at first you see their unique skills and you find it really exciting, but some of them are really getting overused (Naruto's Rasengan), this again, leads back to the fillers.  If there were less fillers, their wouldn't be a need to do such a thing and fans wouldn't get so sick of seeing the same skills over and over again. 
Enjoyment: I did enjoy it, but you have to look at it as a whole, which means in the presence of the fillers, in which case my enjoyment decreased as each episode goes by and getting frustrated at seeing Naruto's Rasengan for the billionth time really didn't help either.     
Overall: A good anime consists of many different aspects, each must come together nicely for the series to be successful and for a good rating.  Naruto lacks in some areas, and no surprise, the ratings are what it is.  I'd still recommend it to those who wishes to enjoy all anime like I do, but for those easily frustrated by long series, this is not for you.

Oregairu was really good, hopefully it gets another season, Hikigaya is a legend and that guy deserves to have another season. Lol, he's brutally honest and just speaks his mind and even though it's not the most positive words, they're always realistic. Yukinon is a good character as well she, like him doesn't really care if anyone doesn't like what she says and just goes out and says it, something I like in people 
--/-- for me 
Good characters 
Good stories in episodes 
It was always fun to watch :) 
I recommend that to anyone who doesn't mind watching school based anime

Alright, this is my first review so please bear with me on this. 
I had recently finished watching the final episode of Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon. How was it? 
Well, it was alright I guess. 
Yes, it's one of those everyone loves that I'm not too fond of. 
I will do my best not to note spoilers. 
Let's start with the story: 
It's about a woman and a dragon girl. Simple stuff. It's basic slice of life stuff, generic at it's finest. It's themes of relationships and family are prevalent throughout the entire series. Not to mention, it also has a touch of fantasy. 
I thought it was alright, but the entire structure has been seen in numerous anime previously, which is why I gave it a -. 
Art: 
Surprisingly, I actually like the art style. It's simplistically adorable and appealing. The colour palette pops out like cherry blossoms on a rainy day. Just your average moe Slice of Life art style. But I'm giving it an - because I actually like the art style, but it's more of my thing and I don't really speak for others. 
Sound: 
I'm no sound technician, and it wouldn't be fair to write a review for the sound if I don't really know how to describe it.  
All I can say is that the background music is fitting for different situations and the theme tune is super catchy! 
Character: 
This is where all the problems come flowing in. 
The characters are either bland or serve no other purpose than to be pedophile fanservice. 
Kobayashi is your Average Jane with a job. She is one of the relatable characters, like many other protagonists. As she is the titular character, you'd expect her to serve a lot of purpose to the plot. She is actually rather likeable. She's an otaku, she drinks beer and is a tomboy. But alas, her personality is... bland? Still likeable, but, eh. 
Tohru is my favourite character because she actually has character. She's energetic, she'll do anything for Kobayashi and has emotions. Could I ask for a more bubbly character bubbly character in the show? To be fair, I kinda laughed whenever she flew Kobayashi over the city due to her humongous size in dragon form.  
Kanna... as adorable as she is, a lot of situations she's in with her classmate Riko are... fanservicey...? I mean.... Kanna is supposed to be in Kingergarten or Elementary...? She's an emotionless (or kuudere) little girl who quickly becomes accustomed to Kobayashi. The only things I like about her is her outfit and the fact that she'll pretty much eat anything that moves. 
Lucoa. LUCOA. I have nothing nice or positive to say about Lucoa. She's basically your local neighbourhood pedophile who was summoned by a - year old boy (whose name is a pun on ""Shota(con)"" who in return gets sexually harassed and abused by Lucoa. Her entire character is pretty much there for pedophile fanservice. I feel like her entire character is one massive disgrace to the actual Quetzalcoatl. Massive negative --- to her. Maybe I'm just being a moral party pooper but... yeah. 
Elma is an office lady dragon. As she had only appeared late into the series, I won't say much but... she's bland as bread. 
Overall I give the characters as a whole a -. 
Enjoyment: 
Let's just say that... without all the noncey stuff in it, it would be a lot better series. Every time I thing of the twister scene with Riko and Kanna and pretty much every scene with Lucoa and Shouta, I feel like I need to run into the nearest church building, and I feel like running into the screen and dragging the poor boy away from the Ick. The blatant in-your-face pedophilia is pretty much rife in this show. I have always been uncomfortable with this theme in the show.  
I liked all the fantasy aesthetics in the show, and sadly, it wasn't really prevalent as the nonce fanservice. I'd love to see more of the fantasy. 
Overall: 
Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon is nothing more than a harem anime with a pedophile fanservice theme. I'm only giving it a - because I enjoy the art style and the entirety of Tohru's character. I think I'd give it a higher score if it wasn't so rampant on it's fanservice. 
Would I recommend it? Probably? Maybe. It's up to you to decide on how you see the show.

Where do I start with this anime? 
Firstly, I will warn you: DONOT WATCH THIS ANIME. This anime is extremely boring with no humour, plot theme and is plain absurd. 
The characters lack originality, they are stupid most of the time. The main character, Yui is the main problem here. i'll explain to you what I mean. 
Story: -/-- 
The story could have developed more, and had the potential to well.... become average. But the plot is ignored, and for most of the show, actually in every episode the main character get bitten by vampires. She gets sexually harassed and doesn't run away when offered the chance to. 
If you are masochists then I will recommend this abomination to you. Since the whole show has extremely dark (more like sexual themes and abuse) themes. It comes to the point where I wonder what I'm watching. That's a day of my life i'll never get back. 
For most of the show, you keep wondering when the story will get deeper or more interesting. I'll be surprised id you sit down and watch all the episodes patiently. 
Sound: -/-- 
Not much to say, but I guess it was alright. Yui's voice was high pitched and squeaky. The Sakamaki brothers had mature, deep voices. 
Art: -/-- 
Not gonna le, as much as I hated the show, the only reason I watched it was B/C of the art. It was pretty good. 
Character: -/-- 
The characters suck. I want them all to go die and never return to the surface of the anime world again. 
Enjoyment; -/-- 
I hated it. I don't even know why I even watched the hole of it. No humour, lots of drama and everyone going loko for yui's blood. 
Overall; -/-- 
Because of the art, I'm giving it a - other than the art. this show is a piece of trash.

This was pretty enjoyable, even if you haven't read ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". 
The best part of this story is the character relationships. The story glosses over most of the politics used for ----s southern Europe in the original book for the sake of updating it to a futuristic space opera, which is a bit ""ehhh"" because if you focus on those background details too much the story starts to fall apart because the world and its politics are not as developed as its source material. And the anime sometimes falls back on those fudgy politics for plot at random points (e.g., the whole thing with the Prince is mentioned maybe twice before a large chunk of exposition is given about it at the end of the story, then ignored again to move on with the plot). But thankfully it keeps bumping back to these character relationships, and focusing more on those, which is great! And the good news is that you don't need to read the book to understand who is who or what's going on, although maybe looking over a summary of the plot might help you keep track of things better. This is supposedly one of the best adaptations of the book, anyway. 
The story itself is a mix of fish out of water meets break the cutie interlaced with a sort of Xanatos gambit revenge plot. As far as I can tell there is no more specific trope for ""rich naive person starts to be broken out of their bubble because of politics and economics"", other than maybe growing up, but this story idea does pop up elsewhere. It's dealt with slowly over the course of the story, because Albert, the central 'cutie' being broken, is dragged along through the learning process literally screaming and fighting just about everyone who's trying to help. At times Albert is very frustrating, but he does have a few very touching scenes where he's learning or helping friends. Interestingly, Albert does have some marketable valuable skills, unlike usual cases of the trope where the feckless rich person is pretty useless until someone puts them to a task where they sort of muddle their way through. It pops up in a minor way, but Albert has at least some mechanic expertise, as he's able to fix a car late in the series without help or evidence that he learned during the series itself, and potentially maintains his motorcycle. It was a nice change of pace, and made the inevitable drop from aristocracy less worrisome. It's not like he can't get a job with his skills, even if that's not ultimately the path he chooses. 
Everyone in the story is complicated, has secrets maybe even they don't know about, and a complicated network of connections to everyone else. There are few one-off characters here, and most everyone has an arc. Going past Albert, and even the specific people Monte Cristo is taking revenge on, all of the spouses are complicated. Heloise, Villefort's second wife, is a detestable but ultimately tragic figure that the story doesn't forget about, even during the climax. The story leaves the fate of those around her ambiguous, though it's possible that she poisoned Valentine's mother, and had a hand in Valentine's grandfather's current state. Madame Danglers seems to be sleeping around with every man in the story (or trying to), and this isn't used as a one-off character descriptor, but comes in for important plot in multiple episodes, affecting the fates and arcs of at least five other characters directly. Valentine herself, despite speaking the least of any of the cast save perhaps her half-brother, gets some strong background development in one confrontation with Albert, and her story, combined with her grandfather's, is never forgotten, and gets more interesting as it moves along. 
Yes, it's Dumas, so complicated and interconnected come par for the course, but the show somehow makes it never exhausting. Seeing Franz's focus and interests develop is compelling, just as watching Madame Danglers and Villefort scheming and how that develops is fascinating. Eugenie's struggle for independence and her anger at her family and her frustration with Albert are ultimately quite heartbreaking. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the climax of Morcerf's story. The dialogue in particular that concerns Albert is quiet shocking, given the little we're shown of his relationship with Albert during the story, but it's also pretty touching, and works by and large. From what I understand, a lot of what's in the manga was left out, and the original book itself is still there for anyone to pick up if they want, so hopefully it's backed up in the source material. Most people in this series aren't great - particularly the ones Monte Cristo is taking principal vengeance on - but their stories are very compelling. And there's an overall theme of taking revenge too far and how it affects those around the subject of such revenge that's fascinating. 
The art is something I imagine early --th century France would be quite proud to have - flamboyant, colorful, and hyperdetailed. The idea of having the single texture that outlines seem to move over is quite neat, particularly when they pull out the sparkly textures. I like Impressionism anyway, so that it was used for the art style here (combined with Ukiyo-e) is just another reason for me to like it. The -D models skate the line of being too much. They look good by and large, even when there are -D models and -D characters in the same image (which happens rarely), but things like the mini mechas were a bit over-the-top. Thankfully they weren't used much. 
One of my biggest criticisms is the opening song. The singer is sort of nasally and bored and just sounds bad. Like someone droning in a lecture decided to put it to song. It comes in to play over the latter end of the last episode and kind of deflates the energy of everything you're watching. The music itself is good, so the effect isn't completely destroyed, but ugh. Wrong singer for this. Otherwise, the music throughout the series, while not mind-blowing, works pretty well. 
There's humor, joy, a metric TON of heartbreak, at least quadruple dosage of break the cutie, and a surprising amount of ho yay despite the apparent minimization when the creative team removed more before the show itself was ultimately put it, even after the trailer. The art is gorgeous, the dialogue is dramatic in a mix of ridiculousness and awe, and the music, excepting that dreadful male singer in the opening, works.  
I recommend that people who like this read Mackenzi Lee's ""The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue"", and watch ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" and/or ""Yona of the Dawn"". The former seems a bit like fanfiction for this series. ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" is a bit of comfort food after this, and ""Yona of the Dawn"" is another fish out water/break the cutie story, even with its own Xanatos gambit, but with a female protagonist. It's also a lot happier (unless you read the manga, which includes more of the darker stuff after the anime stopped; although don't let that stop you because the manga is great).

This is an AMV with the song Yume no Kakera made by Eri Nobuchika, animated by Studio -°C. 
The music was interesting, beautiful vocals of Eri Nobuchika but when it came to the visuals... Well they were unique, not for my taste but probably for others especially the design of the two main characters, they looked very evil O.o which confused me. 
I am not sure about the plot, also that it seemed to be symbolic. 
For me it seemed that this AMV is about two lesbian women who are driving off to get away from a society which tries again and again to destroy them, destroy their ways.  
So it seemed to be a story about two empowered lesbian women fighting for their freedom and won´t be stopped for being oppressed for their sex and sexuality. (All the evil villains was men, so I think there also is a somewhat sex battle) 
I am not a SWJ nor am I a feminist (i am egalitarian), I can appreciate artworks who tries to show people that you can break the norm of the society and that you should be embracing yourself, my main critique is that all the Villains are men.  It seemed as a very patriarchy society who tried to hunt down the two main characters. 
I am probably interpreting it way too much, haha XD 
I can only underline that my mainproblem with this one is still the poor visuals, it annoys me! 
But overall good song, visuals could have been better but it is still somewhat entertaining.

Tldr, bad writing, unlikable characters, and animation errors make this a truely unenjoyable experience from start to finish, with EXTRA bad parts thrown in for good measure. 
I've played every Danganronpa game, and read every story and relevant side plot. 
Starting from the first moments of this anime you'll notice a surprising lack of budget. The art is barely passable for a series of this size, the sound direction is forgettable at best, and the writing is awful. The character's are where danganronpa has always shined, but don't expect them to save the story this time. They are completely unlikable, and have no real set motivations or goals. The only time you'll learn anything new, interesting, or plot relevant about a character is in flashbacks seconds before they die. 
Skipping the art and sound, which are both merely low budget, we'll talk about the writing and story. As mentioned, the new characters have no real set motivations or personalities. They exist merely to bump heads with characters you know from DR-, and have no lives beyond that. You never get the feeling one of these characters will be missed by someone, you never get the feeling that they were someones loved one or partner, these characters ONLY exist in the vacuum of this anime plot to chase Naegi and Aoi around for -- minutes an episode.  This may lead you to believe that Naegi and Aoi are central figures to the plot, that they are relevantly unraveling the mysteries and being developed as characters. You'd be wrong though. They have nearly no plot relevance, they are only there along with the rest of the living Dr- cast to pretend to die at the end of episodes so viewers will watch the next episode. It never sticks though, and some of the fakeouts get pretty insulting by the end of it. Episode seven in particular is just filler, and can be completely skipped. Episode - is when the anime really hits it's lowest points however. Everything after episode - will leave you scratching your head, wondering why this anime was made in the first place. The anime ends where it starts, a status quo were nearly nothing new has been introduced to the DR canon, and the UTMOST ""Care"" was taken to make sure that NOTHING about the old characters has changed in any way. 
On pure enjoyment factor alone, I'd recommend fans of the games, and fans of anime in any form to avoid this series. Scenes will drive you crazy with constant continuity errors, animation errors, and forgotten plot threads.  The premise is stupid, and is never justified. Unlikable characters are made up on the spot just to die. Deathflags are so obvious that you'll never be surprised or caught off guard. Characters walk on screen and announce their time to die, then die, and none of the other characters really seem to care. Several times characters are found dead, or murdered directly in front of everyone, and nobody bats an eye or cares.  Ends on Status Quo restoration,  the entire anime can be removed without losing anything from the series.  
I'll finish this review on a somewhat positive note. The characters Ruruka and Seiko have their own subplot that spans for almost the entire series filling up whatever time isn't taken by Naegi and Aoi doing basically nothing. The sub plot has some obvious flaws but is interesting and keeps the episodes moving, and these two characters actually end up being developed because of it, you may accidentally end up even caring for them.  However just as their character arcs come to a close the story reminds you how stupid you were for liking any of the new characters. Then replaces them with even more Aoi and naegi, just running around and not really accomplishing anything.

Like pretty much all other Naruto films, the third one follows the same template. Sadly, it too suffers from a lot of problems. **Minor spoilers** 
We are introduced to a new character who supposedly were a friend of Jiraiya & co, although never mentioned or seen in the main series. This character and his story is basically a copy-paste of Orochimaru's, though we are not told what happened to him after certain events. Suddenly, he appears with his new over-powered abilities which he got using a technique that up to this point has been unheard of. Being a mediocre shinobi back in the day, it is unclear how this man managed to obtain the sources of these powers and nothing is shown to explain this. Hiruko, as his name is, wants to declare a -th great war once he gets a hold of some more strength. This is the main plot but again, the film simply will not explain why he wants to do this. One would think this guy has moved on to another village after all those years ...but apparently not. Since this guy is from Konohagakure and probably was banished, Tsunade was aware of his abilities and should therefore be wary of what he is up to. However, for some reason the guys in green decide to not give a shit and claim that he is too strong to be dealt with when he shows up. Even though they could've prevented the problem in the first place. Hiruko is now said to be impossible to beat, but if he's so dangerous, how come we've never heard anything about him before? I'll tell you why. Because rushed and forced story. 
The characters are mostly poor in this movie. Apart from Naruto, who does the same thing wherever we see him, there's the bad guys, Naruto's friends, Tsunade and Kakashi. The main villain and Kakashi had the key roles in this film but for me the spotlight was shining on Shikamaru as his mind was conflicted by duty and the words of Obito. Sakura didn't do much to make herself shine except for comic relief (not that that's unusual) however the film set up a neat little reference to the ""loss"" of Sasuke once she reacts to Naruto's promise about bringing back Kakashi. Both Gaara and Tsunade felt out of character and considering the forced story it's pretty safe to say that the writers did not take their character behaviors into account. Tsunade is a wise woman, there is absolutely no reason why she would sacrifice Kakashi to Hiruko when he clearly stated that obtaining Kakashi will make him immortal. Actually, there's no way she'd sacrifice him in the first place 'cause she's a softie. Yes, I know. They had a plan, but there's a chance of it being unsuccessful and it's totally unnecessary when they could just kill the guy and be over with it. Couldn't they have locked up Kakashi instead? Would have made more sense. Hiruko, Mr. Reptile Mouth, had an odd but interesting character design which I actually did not mind. The same thing can not be said about his accomplices, especially not the female. Without revealing too much, all of their abilities were stupid and one of them even looked like something straight out of Digimon. It is odd to me why close to every bad guy in these movies have people helping them as they're hardly likeable characters. A quick flashback on how Hiruko made these friends would clear things up. 
Naruto: Shippuuden Movie - has animation that is superior to what's in the main series. Although not as good as in the -nd film, the fighting scenes has good looking effects that fly by smoothly and  look very cool. The quality of the artwork itself has only improved by a bit and things such as background images could be given a bit more detail as with all other Naruto films up to this point. The music in this film is not bad, it works well with the scenes if you pay attention to it, but that is what you will have to do to notice it since it does not stand out in any way. I did not pay much attention to be honest but my grade for the sound effects would be a -. They are average. 
When it comes down to a conclusion, it has to be said that Inheritors of Will of Fire is a pretty good media-production that fails to deliver in terms of story and depth because it forces out a rushed plot as an excuse for including lots of action.

Ive seen monogatari series from the season - and all the movies and mini series/side arcs. Shaft doing really good job in making this series interesting if not for them i'd definetely alrdy dropped this series long time ago, definetely will give - score to the main arc bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari and --- score for some of the side arcs.  
This series feels really dragged already. and it basically have almost the same pattern for every arcs after bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari, things going down hill from there and boring for me,  
Araragi likes girls and surrounded by girls but seriously just go fuck hanekawa or senjougahara already, the series always have that kind of scene where araragi want to fondle breast or he is feeling horny and some scene with foreplay(but not actually doing anything) thats getting old and really dumb. 
In this movie he did it again we can see hanekawa running naked but without nipples and vagina so its not censored and they both do some bs foreplay but ended up not doing anything and suddenly after araragi sees hanekawa massive tits he somehow got massive spirit coming from nowhere to fight kiss shot and this kind of things have happened basically in almost every arcs, this series can be easily turned into the hentai series. I was laughing real hard watching this movie especially hanekawa parts where she become slut for araragi it isnt a serious thing anymore for me its been going on from season - until now. 
So basically the pattern is a new girl with big trouble is appearing-breakdown-horny phase-sudden enlightment-defeating enemies-adding a new girl to his harem. Well after seeing araragi so long i started to feel disgusted bcs he seems like something that the creator of this series wanted to become in his dope fantasy the guy who got backups in higher place which is pretty chicks except oshino and beats badass alpha male to save pretty chicks and save the day, its just become repetitive and the story isnt that interesting anymore, well with all the money he made from this series alone will be enough to fuck all the girls in his fantasy or even roleplaying. I started to get that thoughts in some of the recents monogatari series and thats disgusting.  
Ps: for any weird people out there who likes to jerk off with anime and likes harem bs bcs your life is miserable, this is just my opinion and save me from your bs and just scroll down if your fragile little heart is hurt and you feel like to debate this.

Ok, I found myself in a world of taste and imagination that I never been before! 
If you're looking for a anime to pass the time and he didn't need that psycho history, this anime is tje perfect choice! 
The delightful plates, rich images, shapes and somehow a wonderfull smell takes you to another level, only to you apreciate the food. 
The characters can't be that deeper, but the history behind the plates are! There were need much research and deepening for not disappointing ours bellys and brain. 
The openings were good, and the first ending was addictive! 
But talking more about the characters, Negumi somehow excelled herself, and found new objectives to move on. Things that nowadays are difficult to insecure people to found. 
Souma's father is hot! (that's all you have to know!) 
And the best part is the appreciation scenes. Somehow they were ridiculous, but make me think that is the real sensation when you eat a delightful food...

Akame Ga Kill is an anime that both revels in it's flaws and attempts to overlook them. It is a nearly perfect definition of ""Adequate"" and you could not find a better candidate to fill the title. I will give a quick spoiler free review before getting into any of the details; 
Akame Ga Kill is a dark fantasy anime which delves into political intrigue, corruption, grey morality scale and attrition of forces through interminable conflict. Basically, it's quite gritty for the chipper art style it boasts, making for a discordant juxtaposition... it works quite well to highlight the injustice and oppression that is played out for the viewer. 
The story is about an armed branch of a rebel group called ""Night Raid"" that engages in assassination, subterfuge and political dissent against a totalitarian and extremely corrupt government. It disrobes its story effectively and pulls no punches when it comes to showing the brutality of the conflict, showing both sides having terrible losses, ending with a fairly satisfactory climax but an atrocious coda. The music is very appealing for the scenarios and the plot moves at blazing speed (Almost too quick to follow at times) but it is intended to move quick, to show how violence sweeps everything with it. 
If you like dark fantasy, action and don't care too much about plot holes, you will enjoy this. 
It is both deep and light , appealing to both sides of the spectrum.  
Now let's get into spoilers; 
ART: 
Although the manga it is based on is far more brutal than the anime, the anime still doesn't hold back, showing people that have been tortured, mutilated and actively killed in a variety of ways. The detail is stunning and visceral, but a lot of the times, the art is quite bland... but I suspect this is intentional to give the viewer a shock when the violence is shown in all of its glory.  
Some of the architecture is also very impressive, when you see the detail and design of medieval hallways, castles and homing areas, you get a real sense of a flow, development and vibrancy in the world. Again, the art is skimped on very often, but when it works it really works. 
CHARACTER and PLOT: 
This is the bread and butter of the show (obviously), the plot moves extremely fast as our main character 'Tatsumi' is semi-forcefully recruited into Night Raid after encountering them within the first episode.  Let it be clear that this show contains ZERO plot armor. Conflicts are established very early as being bloody (Read: Characters are killed)... and they do not forget about this. Characters can be slain at a moments notice and no one is safe. 
This makes the plot have a certain urgency to it, alongside the feeling that the main characters could truly lose. This is a very good thing as it makes us wonder how each conflict will turn out, especially when the antagonists are shown to be very competent and powerful (Ex: Esdeath is depicted as being insurmountably powerful), but this is where the problem comes in, there are a lot of plot holes that make characters act completely out of character and throw away a lot of the good-will established in the series. 
In one scenario you might have a character, for absolutely no reason, decide to take on the entire Night Raid forces by himself, isolated from the rest of his forces... another scenario has a character making an established suicidal act and then surviving for no better reason than ""The plot says this character will not die"". It makes no sense and these plot holes mount up into one very irritating pile towards the end. 
The political intrigue and governmental corruption is not dealt with, the anime unfortunately outpaced the manga and instead they had to make due with what they had, meaning we have a rushed ending where things are solved out of nowhere. It is especially jarring when you realize that they abandoned the official story and started their own as multiple key-scenes are directly contradicting of each other (Ex: Najenda meeting Esdeath during an assassination meeting (This should result in the murder of Najenda) and then in the next episode they act as if it never happened). Another plot hole is a character has a ""Trump card"" that will be fatal upon third use... this character uses it three times and does not die. I know it sounds like a minor nitpick but it is not, they establish rules and then directly violate these rules, it makes for a frustrating watch. 
As a quick aside; 
Most of the characters are well developed with very well defined personalities, except for one. 
The titular ""Akame"" character was very poorly developed and a complete quality vaccuum.  
Where you have extremely vibrant and interesting characters like Esdeath and Chelsea, Akame just comes off as a complete Mary-Sue with no real defining characteristics, motivations or desires. This was a major drawback as  we're expected to root for Akame but she simply does not meet us half-way by being an interesting character.  
Her fighting style is boring. 
Her design is boring. 
Her dialogue is boring. 
Her backstory is boring. 
The show would have been better off without her, but that is minor in the grand scheme of things. 
ENJOYMENT: 
All of that being said, it is a very enjoyable show, precisely because it eschews the plot armor that is so common in these types of series. Again, characters can and will die in these scenarios. No character is safe. This makes each fight feel tense and exciting. Add to this the sections with intense gore, high action and character development and you have a strong combination of elements. 
OVERALL: 
It is not a good anime. It has huge amount of plot holes and a tendency to abandon major sub-plots due to outpacing the source material.... however, it has enough action, variety, gore and intrigue to keep it interesting for the full episode series. 
Add a point if you have a high tolerance for plot holes, character inconsistency and rushed endings.

This is another one of those shows that tries too hard to be edgy and raw and brutal and ends up being cringy and bland and boring. 
The plot is pretty average and quite frankly kind of ridiculous even for edgy anime standards. The whole ""magical braces that control people minds even when they're removed"" is just too nonsensical and convenient and the explanation they give for it is incredibly weak. And hey, i get it, it's anime, it's not supposed to be super realistic and incredibly believable but the thing is they kind of try to make it seem like that, they take the whole thing super seriously and even give a lame ""scientific"" explanation for the whole thing but it's all super weak and convenient. It just doesn't feel organic or even well thought of. 
Also, this is another one of those shows where Japan has no government, the police basically doesn't exist and people are harassed, assaulted and even killed in the streets without nobody doing anything about it. Super fresh stuff. 
The breaking point for me was when the story hints that the main villain might be a -- year old super evil genius. At this point i decided the show didn't give me enough to actually care about it and i wasn't willing to keep watching a super edgy and raw show where the evil mastermind behind the whole slave game was potentially a child. If you like that sort of thing though, this could be the perfect anime for you. 
Looks good, sounds good, the plot is bad and the character are average at best.

As you can tell I didn't completely hate this show. I actually really wanted to love it and up until a fixed point, this could have been in my top -- easy. 
The art I gave a -, it's solid nothing to complain about here really. It just wasn't over the top enough to be more than good. 
Sound was fine, I enjoyed all the music and the sound quality in both sub and dub was fine so - here as well. 
Story: I gave this a -.The plot in itself is fine and interesting but the way they go about it after the first -- episodes or so lacks the intensity and chemistry for obvious reasons once you get to that point. 
Characters: This is one of my biggest issues with this series and there will be slight spoilers in here so I will try and not use names but still get the point across. The main antagonist for the series for the majority of the series that will have you hooked and on the edge of your seat was the highlight outside of the protagonist. The way it was written and the character himself was almost to good and could have caused the series to end in a different manor but with  his replacement after the first bit the show takes a sharp nose dive into the dumpster. The replacement is a poor wanna be of first bit who has no real chemistry built or even attempting to be built. He is literally an emotionless clone. Most of the other characters serve their purpose well enough I guess some of it is rather boring and generic and the replacement of the starting Antagonist really halted all momentum for this series and caused negative marks among a bit portion of the fan base. I know for me and almost every person I have spoken to about this series really ended for them after the first antagonist was no longer part of the show even though we watched/read the rest.

Set in old japan with many historical characters that really lived around that time, it tells us about the story of a samurai that is trying to atone his past living a new life. 
The first arc show us the links between the main characters and their past and where specifically is gonna be set the story. 
Kenshin (main character) is a samurai with a good personality who gets well with everyone but has a tainted past that he is trying to amend by making the right choices in his new life. 
The adventures of a samurai in his new life, where you can find action, love, drama, terror, comedy and much more if you like long stories of the past. 
I watched this series many times and it taught me a lot about life, respect, honesty and pride. 
Rate: -/-- 
Thanks for reading.

The first season of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is absolutely brilliant.  For those who are not familiar with this series, it's a spinoff of the ---- movie Ghost in the Shell, which has influenced many directors, not least of which are the Wachowski brothers who later created The Matrix. 
Cyberpunk anime is relatively rare, and in this chest of obscure goods, Stand Alone Complex arguably shines the brightest.   
The main storyline, which follows The Laughing Man incident (per the Review Guidelines, I'm not going to elaborate on the plot details, if you really want them, see Wikipedia), is a gripping thrill ride through the dark underbelly of a fully cyberized society.  The series explores a host of typical cyberpunk scenarios, ranging from sensory perception espionage to corporate terrorism to cybernetic body swapping and much more.  Philosophical issues typical in cyberpunk media are incorporated relatively seamlessly into the series, such as the identity problem and emergent behavior. 
Carefully considered references to relevant Western literature (particularly Catcher in the Rye and The Laughing Man by JD Salinger) appear in the anime often, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that, unlike in most other anime, they actually tied into the plot quite well and in many cases foreshadowed the future in unpredictable fashion.   
The series is action-packed but tasteful in its portrayal of violence.  People die in various ways, and just enough blood and gore is shown to keep the experience visceral, but not to the point of offending anyone.  I liked the honest representation of warfare (a lot of other anime will just have the protagonists ""knock out"" enemy combatants; this series doesn't hold back in this regard, people who are shot can and often do die-- something I appreciate as it maintains tension well.)     
I don't usually describe a series in this way, but SAC is just, simply, ""cool.""  The Section - team uses a variety of equipment, ranging from thermo-optical camouflage (essentially invisibility) to high powered sniper rifles.  The way the team (an elite group of special ops veterans) plans and executes their missions is very professional and the directors paid careful attention to tactical details normally ignored in other anime.   
The art in this series, btw, is spectacular.  The team in charge very clearly made good use of computers, particularly when they did their cartoon shading for the Tachikomas.  The result is a clean, very detailed and yet natural style. 
The series does have its weaknesses of course.  The stand alone episodes (those unrelated to the main storyline) vary greatly in their quality.  Some episodes are too predictable, such as Episode - in which (surprise) an AI doesn't behave as it should and Togusa wonders whether it gained a ""ghost"" (a term in the series that's semantically similar to ""soul"").  Why is it that practically every plot-relevant AI encountered acts like it has gained a ghost?   
Character development was not very even in this anime.  Batou, Togusa, the Major, and Aramaki are the only characters with significant character development.  Saito and the rest remain enigmatic and don't have any backstory until the -nd season.  Even the talking, thinking tanks (Tachikomas) are more central to the plot than the rest of the Section - team.  At least they get a couple episodes mostly to themselves.   
Some people who are paying close attention will also notice some annoying misconceptions, eg ""offensive"" firewalls being the most annoying and conspicuous.   
But all in all, it was a great season.  It's too bad the -nd one is so disappointing in contrast.

I'd seen a whole crapload of hype about this on -chan, and after talking to a friend about it, I decided to give it a shot. I guess the only thing that kept me watching School Days was that I knew what was going to happen at the end. Up until the last three episodes, it's a pretty boring drama with unlikable characters and a slow-moving plot, but watching it was worth it, just so I could see that epic ending ;)

There isn't really much one can say about this. Obviously you can't expect much plot from a special that's only two minutes long, but even by short ova standards this was appalling. 
The story is non-existent which is to be expected. The animation style is really bad and doesn't resemble the SoniAni series at all. The sound quality seemed pretty bad too. There was a very brief fanservicey moment which failed to be sexy due to the awful animation. And I'm guessing this was meant to be funny, but it fails at that too. Even with it's incredibly short run-time, this is not worth a watch.

Style - It is fairly well animated, but the action is often seen from awkward angles which makes it confusing and frustrating. The character design is also not particularly aesthetically pleasing. - out of -.  
Character - The characters are terrible, and I have good reason to believe that the director never intended for the audience to like or relate to any of them. Ichise doesn't know any emotion other than rage, and ends up killing everyone and then dying a lonely death. Oonishi is an idiot who doesn't even understand the organization that he supposedly leads, and ends up getting betrayed. Ran practically never says anything; the only thing we know about her is that she can see the future and she doesn't like it. Doc is another idiot who doesn't understand anything and ends up committing suicide. - out of - for utterly unlikable and completely forgettable characters.  
Story - The story is utterly awful, in the worst sense of the word. Texhnolyze would have you believe that in the future, mankind gets divided into - parts - the normal and sane people live in the surface world, and the violent criminals live in the underground. The normal people end up dying out because....nobody has any children. NOBODY. The mind boggles at how completely stupid and idiotic this is. Also, suddenly SHAPES from nowhere, kill everyone, and then randomly grow roots and die. Completely nonsensical. - out of - for making absolutely zero sense.  
Overall - out of -- for having a mediocre style, terribad characters and a completely nonsensical plot.

Uobbuchou is about fish who are businessmen because there are no people to run the businesses.  They look horrifying and act like insane people.  It’s overly Japanese in its humor.  That’s about it. 
I’m not sure if this was meant to be a pilot or a stand-alone film, but it definitely feels like a pilot.  It’s got itself a nice little opening and ending as if they were going to make more episodes.  I guess the rest of the world felt the same as me, it was awful and deserved to be forgotten.  But it wasn’t forgotten, because I found it.  But I look for this crap so I guess I’m to blame.  Plus the idea of underwater society was perfected with the first three seasons of Spongebob, so there’s really no reason for this to exist.

I really despise this movie. Not because of anything about the movie itself, as it would have been perfectly enjoyable in a vacuum. The problem with Laputa is its utter lack of originality. Every single thing about this movie is Future Boy Conan. Its about -- hours shorter and paced to account for the difference, but there is not a single thing about the content of this movie that is not directly copied from that show. Aside from the significantly more impressive visuals and soundtrack expected with the name Ghibli, nothing feels remotely unique to Laputa as anything more than a clone of Conan with a different Miyazaki filter applied to it. The difference between the two is little more than the difference between two bullshit isekai with fans parading a minute twist as a totally original show. As soon as it became evident that the film would have nothing more to offer, the only possible enjoyment for me was matching up every single plot point and occasionally even scene to one I had already seen. Without a doubt this is the superior form of the story, but having seen the other Laputa offers absolutely nothing to a viewer aside from looking stunning.

This is my first review and i'm not really that good with writing in English. But I'll do my best. 
Story---: I think overall Gintama has a pretty good story with comedy, action, to drama and I always have that feeling of satisfaction in every episode .Gintama Season - never really gets me bored. I find the comedy in season - better than the first somehow. I literally cried out of laughter. The serious arcs were also pretty epic and has a beautiful story to it. So i give it a -- 
Art--: Not much really change in art. It's much more high quality though but I think that its best for Gintama. The art style on the fight scenes also improved alot. And the facial expressions on the Characters are alot more funnier than it used to.   
Sound--: The music in Gintama' is pretty epic. The OPs and EDs are awsome. And I really enjoy the background music in every episode and it really gives life and the mood of the scene.Still  I give it a - 
Characters---: Characters in Season - is still awsome as they were in season -. With new characters showing that makes Gintama even more awsome. Definitely a --. 
Enjoyment---: Hell yeah it was awsome! In Gintama, every episode is epic to the core. It's really fun to watch, especially the serious arcs. All in all I give it a --. If it's possible maybe an --, but that's just me. :D 
Overall---: Gintama is fun anime that I really. Each episode is worth it. And the comedy killed me. And the fight scenes are very epic and badass.

I will be very honest about this show. I have NEVER been depressed watching a show, but this one was one of them. It lacks good character development and none of the main or supporting characters were likable. It was like, I wanted to skip many of the scenes that were either too boring or I just wanted to get the show over with, to be honest. Overall, I would not recommend watching this show. There was a lack of excitement watching and the storyline was confusing. I did not see the story getting anywhere. I heard that the manga is way better than the anime, but I am judging based on the show alone.

the fact this anime has as high of a rating as it does proves that MAL's reviews are total garbage, and that its community is clueless. this anime had promise in the first few episodes introducing an interesting conflict but it starts developing plot holes quickly and lends you feel like the gold tribe are kinda idiots, despite that the anime rants and raves about how wise they were. ultimately it keeps this theme up talking up everything and showing the opposite. it talks about th danger of the combat but then you just watch the hero's destroy the enemy like they are swatting flies. then its combat scenes are nothing but jargon from the ships captian; he goes on and on about useless dialogue including ""send all forces to line three"" what ever that means because the never show anyone moving to any lines and its in space so where would lines even be? ultimately half of the combat scenes are just useless wastes of time and it loses all tension. followed by the hero covered in plot armor jumping in front of giant lasers because i can do anything im in a magic mech suit, then the hero destroys the bug enemies without regard for them but then he has a mission to kill other people in similar mechs  attack him and he just sits there hugging them not attacking them at all. like why isn't he using the same attacks on the mech enemies that he is on the bug enemies. there are so many logic holes that the story better resembles swiss cheese. and this garbage has higher ratings that actually good anime. im utterly dumbfounded. maybe it has some kind of crazy come back like tri gun had after episode three but im not patient enough to wait past episode - to find it.

(Be advised that I only watched five episodes before dropping this anime. However, that does not mean that I didn’t do my research.) 
Yumeria certainly isn’t an anime that I’d watch again. I actually couldn’t even watch it all the way through. I lasted for maybe five episodes, and then I finally realized that nothing new was going to happen, and that this was just some harem/ecchi wannabe. 
There’s nothing wrong with harem or ecchi, if it’s executed well. If the anime wasn’t filled with clichés, had a good story, etc., then I would actually be glad to watch. If it was cliché, but everything else was great, I would also watch. However, Yumeria was just barely executed decently. 
I found the story to be lacking. I actually liked the first episode—I laughed a little, and I thought it would get better—but there’s simply nothing added to it. When I think of fighting monsters in a dream world, I think beautiful graphics, great transformations, vivid attacks, unique twists. Yumeria has none of this. Maybe I was too hopeful. 
Speaking of beautiful graphics and vivid attacks, the art did almost nothing to execute this. The animation was, in most parts, a bit faulty. Some things were drawn fairly well; a majority of things were not. For example, in the opening, the characters look different than they do in the actual anime. They just seem drawn wrong. 
In retrospect, I didn’t like the art style in general. If that’s what you like, then, by all means, take my opinion with a grain of salt. 
The music—I can’t really comment on it. I don’t remember any music in the episodes that I watched. The opening song wasn’t my thing; the ending song I never stayed to listen to. 
For Yumeria, characters got the highest rating at -. I hate Tomokazu, our typical ""normal"" perverted main character... Except when he interacts with Mone.  
The girls were bearable, not necessarily because they were unique (they aren't unique at all - we have the biggest lolita, the cute one, the shy one with feelings for Tomokazu, the obnoxious busty one, and the obsessed stalker) or seemed real but because I thought they were amusing, and I liked the way that they interacted with one another (just not with Tomokazu). They were sort of funny. 
The girls in Yumeria are generally quite kawaii. Mone is my personal favorite. She's just adorable, though a little obnoxious. The transformation scenes were probably the best part of the animation—I thought they were fairly cool. 
Plus, I love me some cute anime girls—just like my absolute favorite character, Ishikari. 
Ishikari's just amazing… HE should have been the main character. Like seriously. 
Overall, Yumeria isn’t an anime to watch if you want something great and jarring. It isn’t good to watch if you want to see some good, hardcore ecchi, either. If you’re someone looking for some good light ecchi—nothing explicit—then you’re either going to have to find those diamonds in the rough or wait until you’re ready for the real stuff. 
If you want something light-hearted and slightly amusing, and you’re open to laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of the Yumeria, you might find this fairly enjoyable. Just don’t expect much, if anything.

Let’s get right to it. I liked how this show showcased the bickering and symbiosis of boys and girls living together. I liked how both pistil and stamen were needed to operate a FRANXXX. I liked the we need to peacefully coexist if we’re to survive vibe. Also it’s beautiful to look at. The use of color is amazing.  
What I didn’t like was the whole second act. New characters are introduced and then ignored. There’s a little world building and what we got is ignored after the episode it appears in. It’s as if one studio made the first eight episodes then handed the series off to the other with a mess of handwritten notes they called a script. I also didn’t like how the characters were cookie cutter clichés. I won’t spoiler it here suffice to say every character has a singular drive and it forms the basis of their personality. There’s no character growth or developments. Every character practically remains unchanged from episode one through to --. 
But I’ll tell you the three things I hated about this show. One is obvious, Ichigo. I hate every single character with this trope, and I wish they’d do away with it knowing that they won’t. Two, is the mecha design. But that’s just me as a real robot fan piling on. The third thing angered me. I watch the last two episodes and get through that touching heartfelt ending only be left with a question; “Was I moved by that ending or did it bring up my memories of Gunbuster’s heartfelt ending?” Since I can’t clearly answer I’ll assume the latter. 
I was gonna give it a one but everyone who didn’t see Gunbuster will love the end. Add Kiss Of Death and the most Shinji Ikari main character since Shinji Ikari (based on how modern teens can relate to him) and I give it a two. There’s something here for some, but not all.

It was so refreshing to see a sports story that does everything it can to not conform to common sports story tropes. Ping Pong The Animation was able to develop unique characters who all had their own interesting qualities and especially interesting motives.  One of the best way this anime thrived was showing the backstories of the characters in order to give the audience insight into how they got to where they are and why they play the way they do.  Even though it is only the second sports anime I have seen, I would find it hard to believe that I will find another one that I like more.  It made me cheer for characters I liked, and still sympathize for the characters I didn't.  Because of that, no character seemed --dimensional.   
I LOVE how the story is able to see so many sides of competitive sports/activities.  It gives arguments for basically ever view and approach to the competitive scene.  I'm not going to pick apart each character, but as you watch it, keep that in mind.  Certain characters really do want to go all the way and become the best.  Others feel obligated to.  Others just play for fun, but they find their fun in getting really good.  Still others just try and try, but simply can't make it to that ""next level of play"".  All of this ultimately ties in to the ending of the show extremely well. 
Now for the unavoidable conversation about the animation.  Some people say they hate it, and honestly I was a LITTLE intimidated going in.  However, the animation alone would have been able to keep me engaged, as it always had something pleasant and exciting to look at.  Sure some of the character designs were over-the-top and cartoonish, but hey... its a cartoon. Some of my favorite moments in this show were the split-screen shots.  It made everything that happened, even mundane conversation, become exciting somehow.  This show really is something to behold. 
Overall, this show was absolutely amazing.  It starts in a place that gives the characters plenty of room to grow, and ends in a place that leaves you loving the main characters, understanding and sympathizing with the secondary characters, and wanted to freaking play some ping pong!  I am really finding it hard to say anything bad about this show.  for now, I'm not gonna give it a --/-- because I feel like it was missing something that could really push it to be one of my favorite shows... however... there is a reason I completed this show in less than -- hours. 
Sentence:  This show is a freaking blast!

I really believed that this anime was going to have a similar plot line to many others and over all was going to be very boring. I finally decided to take a chance with it when several people kept recommending it to me. As I continued to watch though episode and episode I knew I was very wrong about Kanon, this anime is very different then most. 
Story -/--: At first like I said I felt like this anime was slow, I didn't really know what was going on, at even some points I was totally confused. After the anime progressed the backgrounds about the girls slowly started to unravel and I felt my self being drawn into the show, wanting to find out more and more. It actually has a great concept throughout the whole anime. It, personally touches me in a different way then maybe other people since I have actually have experiences like the ones shown in the anime. 
Art --/--: The art in the anime was fantastic, they drew everything so well, especially the environment and snow. It made me feel like I was actually part of the show. I  loved how they drew the characters as well. 
Sound --/--: The sound was fantastic, I could hear them clearly though out the entire anime and the music was incredible. The music they selected fitted perfectly in the anime and what was going on during the time. 
Character --/--: Each character seemed to pop out at me. Their very unique and creative personalities was one of the main things that really drew me into the show. I liked how they all had their own style. I also like the fact that not all characters got along at first like they usually do in some animes. 
Enjoyment --/--: Watching this was very enjoyable, not once was I ever truly bored with it. It always seemed like their was something new happening in each episode and they really never dragged anything on longer then it needed to be. 
Overall -/--: I give it a - overall, I really don't like just handing out --s since I think that nothing is ever perfect. I really recommend anyone that is into  romance animes with some tragedy in it. It is a really great anime and I feel like everyone should at least give it one chance.

If any fans of the original Little Witch Academia film or fans of its sequel The Enchanted Parade are reading this review and are worried about this TV adaptation holding up to the standard of its progenitors, allow me to lay your fears to rest. Little Witch Academia TV is GREAT. It is a worthy successor in every way to the movies that generated so much interest, but at the same time no knowledge of the two films is necessary to enjoy this new TV anime. The show is fun, light, and heartwarming, and I will confidently recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested. 
Art: Exemplary of what anime can be. Every frame is beautifully rendered in a way that looks both meticulous and full of love of the craft. 
Sound: Good but unremarkable, although the OP is cute and the ED is gorgeously drawn. 
Story: Harry Potter in an all-girls school. Some unlikely misfit friends come together in a school for witches, and learn who they are and what they can do along the way. The tone is light, the challenges they face are believable within the world, and the story is driven by real-seeming characters with genuine interactions. As the series progresses a more serious plot begins to develop, which casts the light-hearted adventures taking place in a more serious light.  
Characters: Unequivocally the high point of the show, even more so than the stellar art. The side characters are all great in their own right, but the main three are really the best that Little Witch Academia has to offer. Main character Akko is a perfect blend of annoying and endearing, and she sucks at magic just enough to act as an audience surrogate without being irritating about it. She is also a curious mix of plucky idiot and self-centered asshole in a way that really shouldn't work but somehow does anyway. Lotte, the most reserved member of the main cast, is the perfect balance of chill to Akko's complete lack thereof. Her presence really grounds the cast as a whole, as she is the most ""normal"" character of the bunch. Sucy, the third of the main characters and hands down my favorite, is a joy to watch. She is cynical, sarcastic, borderline evil, and a perfect wild card to pull the group into and out of danger with her dangerous potions and even more dangerous lack of safety standards. Episode -, which is mostly about Sucy, is one of the best episodes of an anime I have seen in years. All in all, a great group of characters on which to focus our story. 
This show is great. Watching it makes me feel good, which is really all I want in a lighthearted anime like this. It is funny, serious, and heartwarming by turns, and is always presented in a way that makes me want to be a part of the world it depicts. Fans of Harry Potter, fans of the preceding two films, and anime fans in general should not miss this show, and I would not be surprised if it turns out to be overall one of the best shows of ----.

Great Teacher Onizuka 
Genres, Comedy, Drama, Ecchi, School 
Episodes--- 
OP-Driver's High,Hitori No Yoru 
ED-Last Piece,Shizuku, Cherished Memories, Driver's High 
Story---/---There is so much that happens, and with a whole class the adventure is nonstop. There are a whole bunch of side stories that gives information on the different cliches in a classroom, then at the end the story finishes with a great climax.While the mood is usually funny, there are some sad and lots of suprising moments that make the series very enjoyable. The series has lots of those what will happen next moments that just really make the story very interesting. 
Sound--/---The OPs/EDs are just great I loved every single one of them. The music feeds the atmosphere of the series perfectly, and with - soundtracks there is plently of music to go around. The seiyuus fit the characters pretty well most of the time. 
Character---/---With a whole classroom of students almost every type of personality is shown, and presented in a very humorous way. Onizuka's personality is really unique, he acts stupid most of the time but there are times when his seriousness really makes him seem cool. He is always very unpredictable and always amazing the viewer and shocking his students. 
Animation--/---This series is pretty old, about --- years old. The art and animation really shows the age, but since this is basically a comedy series, it doesn't hurt the series that much. 
Value/Enjoyment---/---I LOVED this series.. i was addicted to the manga about two years ago.. and finally watched the series. This is one of those anime that you MUST have!! I was laughing through every episode! I read the manga first about - years ago.. but I still laughed at every funny scene despite knowing what was going to happen.

The second season of SnS sucked. 
I'm sorry but if you liked this you must be one of the popular girls at your middle school. The first half of this season has absolutely no real action and is complete drama. Now, something you have to understand is that I hate drama, and this got so bad, I read basic synopsis on all the episodes from ---- where the spoilers final died and was done. The ending to this season is also kind of a WTF and in my personal opinion should have ended there. 
I wouldn't really waste my time with this season and just watch the first one and then ask a friend whose seen the anime or just look up a video bit of the ending, which, by the way, was really slapdash work.

This anime made me really want to write my very first review,  I'll make this short and spoiler free! 
I'm doing this, in hope that maybe - or - other people would not miss out this masterpiece! 
At first, I didn't really want to watch it because the art style is pretty old, but don't let that hold you back, this anime has a lot to offer. Because of the good reviews it had, I couldn't help but check it out. The first episode got me hooked and went on ahead to watch the anime whenever I had the time to.  
The story is about a -- year old virgin, pervert, and a former biker gang member, Eikichi Onizuka who wanted a change of pace and become the Greatest Teacher ever! He tries to do so by helping his students with their problems even if it means risking his own life and job. Get ready for a  ride filled with Onizuka's random ways of figuring things out, mischievous pranks, and badassery!

First, sorry for my bad grammar because it is not my main language :D ahaha. 
okay, first the story 
-/-- 
i gave it - score because i thought the story of this anime is very original, even though the based of this anime is dealing with life and death, the way it executed is very good. The Idea of having to play a game to determine which place they deserved is really cool ahahaha. 
art 
-/-- 
i gave it - score, the art is not very outstanding, but it still fits the anime really well. 
sound 
-/-- 
the sound is good, especially the happy-go-lucky opening song and an emotional ending song, which end every episode really well. 
character 
--/-- 
i gave the character -- score, because of their interactions with each other. especially onna and decim. They build their relationship and character little by little every episode. 
enjoyment 
--/-- 
in the end, i really enjoy this anime. 
overall i gave this anime -/--, this anime is great in its own way, it may not look like a superpower battle like Naruto, Dragon ball, or a Mind Battle like Death Note. 
Give this anime a chance, and you won't be disappointed.

Ah, Nana. I have to say this is one of my all time favourite anime's. The story was beautiful and the turmoil and joy the characters experienced honestly had me in tears at times.  
I loves the music in every aspect, both bands featured in the show had unique and interesting sounds. The art for Nana blew me away. The detail in every work is incredible and is a testament to the skill of the artist. 
The characters where so dynamic, developed and well introduced it made me feel like they really could be actual people just fashioned into a anime. 
Overall i have to give Nana a -- because it blew me away on so many levels. 
I recommend this anime to anybody over the age of --, only because the story is very realistic in a sense that nothing seems to be watered down from they way it would actually play out in real life (example: People dating DO sleep together) 
Pure enjoyment :)

I was not a fan of this anime. The concept seemed good but ended up being a mess. Kodaka and Yozora start a club in order to make friends. The fact the no one wants to be friends with Kodaka because his hair is yellow and makes him look like a thug is ridiculous. Yozora is a freaking bully. It's hard to feel sad for her because she treats Sena like shit. I felt so bad for Sena. You can't help but feel bad for Sena. Kodaka is a little bitch for not helping Sena when Yozora attacks her. He complains to Yozora and tell every time that she wrong for she's doing. Yet he stands there all the time and does shit. Kodaka later finds out that Yozora is his child good friend that he thought was a boy. When he finds out he not even shocked. That was just stupid. The only characters i liked in this anime was Rika, Kobato, Yukimura, and Maria. This anime was bad. It gets a -/-- from me on MyAnimeList

""This is not the world i was expecting!"" 
And i can't say it better then the protagonist! I thought it was going to be another ""trapped in a fantasy world"" but guys, how much i was wrong! Before starting to analyze other aspects i have to say this is anime is all a PARODY: flying cabbages, water tricks, soccer with heads and more will make the viewer ask him/herself ""what the hell i am watching?"" but if you actually enjoy a good comedy look no farther. 
Story - - 
The plot itself is the ""weak point"" for me because being a comedy/parody it's pretty much about giving troubles to our party members but HOW those events are developed make it totally very nice to see. Furthermore a special notice goes to how Kazuma (the main character) grows: he learns more skill going on and use them in a very ingenious way making the story even interesting making you think ""how will he use his skill now to solve the problem?"" 
Characters - - 
Absolutly the best point. The members of the ""main party"" are well characterized and at a certain point of the show you'll think you almost know them for real(VA really did a good job with acting)! Kazuma itself it's one of the best character i have ever seen being able to break many cliche (ex:"" don't drink too much or the spell will not work""-he will not drink at all). The sub characters are not well made as the main group but they are there for making you laugh and trust me, they will. 
Art - - 
While the characters may be your ""standard characters"" the animation of spells is really amazing!! It deserves at least -!( EXPLOSION!) But well i can't rate only relying on spells... 
Enjoyment - -- 
This is actually subjective but i really liked it a lot. Never got bored, not a single time. Some jokes may be repetitive but never fall on the boring type (""Yes, i am Kazuma"" while people start saying bullshits it's always gold) 
Overall - - 
And here we are again. It's a fantasy parody for everyone (well the ep - is a bit too ecchi, so not really for every kind of audience..): a good plot, crazy characters with a one sane man makes jokes awesome and with a good touch of nice-to-watch skills. 
If you like this kind of show you have to give it a try!

Highly recommend b/c it's the most sophisticated coming of age anime that I've encountered yet. Western viewers easing into anime should watch anime films first before series because there are more palatable gems in movies than in series imo. 
PROS 
-realistic and VERY likable main cast/personalities. No extremes like tsundere-moe dichotomy or goodie two shoes. Trio baseball get-togethers are fun to watch, not expositional 
-confident female protagonist--pro b/c it's a rarity to have a great one w/out making her seem rude/conceited 
-relative lack of pillow shots which plot and pace-driven viewers  can appreciate 
-transitioned Makoto's adjustment to time leaping in a concise, humorous,  and appropriate way to development. Props b/c this is hard to do--even in Steins;gate, I felt that some of the time leap sequences were slow and boring 
-nail biting climax. Having watched this after wolf children, honestly wasn't sure what Hosoda was going to do.  
-STRONG POINT: the film KNOWS its limits and works within its boundaries. It doesn't try to take the butterfly effect to tremendous, unnecessary proportions like world war - or politics or pretentious philosophy. Hosoda's message is clear and focused. The element of time leap is humorous and more importantly relevant to the protagonist. Yes it contains anime ""tropes:"" high school, friendship, and romance, but is it cliche? absolutely not, and almost no elements felt shoehorned. And this is great: sticking to a tradition shouldn't be dismissed as cliche. A great deal of it is what makes anime anime.  
-loved the ending: Hosoda executes a tricky element in which he doesn't reveal everything about the story but doesn't make it feel inconclusive or incomplete. This was no gimmick of leaving it ambiguous for the sake of it. I think it was executed perfectly. The conclusion was frustrating >< but mature, honest, and understandable. 
-Hosoda reveals a very underrated and particular message about maturity and young people--look for it! 
-music wasn't amazing and couldn't find a piece that I think stands strongly on its own. But it works within the parameters of the film. 
CONS (virtually nothing major) 
-all stories dealing with time leaping does have some illogical inconsistencies when you start to deconstruct it 
-some elements came to me suddenly but I got on board 
-was not a fan of his animation style in wolf children but slowly becoming one 
Ultimately, I liked Girl who leapt through time better than wolf children. In both movies, the themes/lessons aren't anything ground breaking, but takes a fantastical element and uses it to depict real/relevant messages. This movie was, to use the perfect adjective, breathtaking. I'm thoroughly impressed for its hard to find a film that has both great entertainment and a message that I can take away for a long time. I'll leave this at a - but the future me (no pun intended) might change it to a --. I see now why people are paying attention to Hosoda. He might be a catalyst that fuses the eastern and western story telling forms to make globally appreciated films in his prime. 
Feel free to read the analysis on what I thought the take away message was about its coming of age theme 
END OF REVIEW 
WARNING: SPOILERS in the analysis.  
Notice that blunders and borderline tragedies occurred when she ironically tried to ""help"" others and by extension ignored/disregarded her own desires. This seems cruel and counter-intuitive at first: Shoudln't selflessness trump selfishness? Well, I think what Hosoda wanted to show through Makoto's story was that, even if you have good intentions, when you launch into action without wisdom, it can unfortunately harm others and yourself. Even though we may THINK we're doing ""good,"" our young, still-tunnel vision of the world may not know the consequences. Through this film, I think Hosoda values practicing introspection in youth as opposed to blindly helping others, especially at the cost of ignoring your own enlightenment. Of course, he showed the consequences of premature decision making in a VERY dramatic way but he has a point here. At the end, Makoto finally confronts herself and others about her honest feelings towards Chiaki and, even though it doesn't work out perfectly, there is definite emotional closure and finally launches her passion for the future. And because of this underrated message, the conclusion doesn't feel like a duex ex machina--it instead makes perfect sense. Respect and understand what YOU want, for it is a way of helping others find their way as well. This is not a new idea, but certainly hits home and he shows it with finesse. And that's what I love about it. It's not a grand social commentary on the dangers of time leaping or butterfly effect or overarching philosophy. Hosoda was focused and very clear from the beginning about what he wanted to present.

Art: -/-- not good not bad . its alright but not that rememberable 
sound: -/-- mediocre sound. i don't even care if the characters or plot is bad 
character: -/-- no realism in any characters. they are kids and they do stuff like that? how does the kids don't know he is a pedophile. not realistic at all. i always look for realism in characters and how relatable the characters are. this does none of that and step into impossible of how they act. 
enjoyment: -/-- i cannot enjoy this abomination of an anime. it makes no sense and trying to make it sooooo unrealistic that it drove me away from this anime. the plot or story does not emotionally grip me with anything. 
overall: i give it a -/-- everything is a mess. plot does not make sense, characters are unrealistic and should not be in myanimelist. i would forgive it if it was a hentai because of the plot and give it a minimum of --/-- but it  
was an abomination of an anime

I'm so happy to see a new season of Natsume Yuujinchou, I thought it would not going to happen. It is, no doubt, my favorite anime. Good story, great characters, with a calm e heartwarming atmosphere. Some episodes will make you laugh, some episodes will make you cry, but most of them will make you calm. My heart  fills with happiness everytime I watch Natsume Yuujinchou. 
Characters: 
Natsume Yuujinchou has a lot of characters with their own particularities. Natsume had a tough childhood, always alone and being bullied, it could have been a reason for him to hate people, but instead, he has compassion and he's able to do anything for those who are important to him. Nyanko sensei, despite trying to look  
tough, he has a big heart and cares more about Natsume than the book. He is fun, funny, cute, brave and, especially, loyal. I'll not write about every character, but I can say all of them are really well worked. Even the Youkais who only appears in one episode. Their stories are always showed in a deep and interesting way.  
Art and animation: 
The art is beautiful. Without exaggerations, simple, and its simplicity makes it so marvelous. Great character's design, no unnecessary details. I love everything about the art style... The characters, the sceneries, the youkais/ayakashis. Everything. And I really love the animation of Natsume returning the Youkais's names, it's pretty ang magical.  
Music: 
The music is marvelous, as always. Not only the opening and ending music, but, especially, the background musics. They match so perfectly with the situations, give you good so many good sensations, sometimes it even gives me goose bumps. Just wonderful, best OST I've ever heard. 
If there's one anime I want to recommend to EVERYONE, this anime is Natsume Yuujinchou.

Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou or Demon King Daimao in the english translation is, well...bad.  As much as I love harems, I cannot under any circumstances put this as one of the best things ever. 
Story: With the story of Sai Akuto, our main protagonist wanting to be a holy man or priest, his life suddenly changes around when a weird raven in a glass container wearing swirly glasses and smoking a cigar tells him that he will be a demon king, something that apparently going to happen as the bird is quite accurate.  (I think the whole bird thing is BS) Then, people begin to freak out at the apparent arrival of the new demon king, and everything goes to crap.   
Characters: Sai Akuto, our main protagonist is a kind person who throughout the whole series, just wants people to know that he isn't the demon king and the absurd rumors about him are well, absurd.  (Seriously, there's one that says he'll impregnate you just by looking at him.) As for the rest of the cast, well...they're crap.  The female ""harem"" is just really a bunch of cardboard cutouts that don't really change.  Like really, they don't change EVER!  Playing the roles as a kuudere, an overzealous blob of fanservice, an overactive rice eater (my personal favorite), the student council president, and the katana wielding blob of fanservice.  The only other guy that was in this series actually had some credible use in the series, but...he gets toned down in credibility after being given this hilariously bad costume.   
Sound and Art: While the art in this anime was fairly good, it was rather ordinary for the most part.  Only in the action scenes was the animation actually very fluid and good.  Other then that, fanservice, fanservice, fanservice.  Repeat that process of art scenes, and you have this.  The sound wasn't really that good to listen to either.  It sounded completely different then what this anime should've had in its soundtrack. 
Personal enjoyment: Oh god, where do I begin?  First of all, tentacle monsters and nipples shouldn't be included!  (personal complaint).  The pacing in this anime was just...horrible.  From episode - everything just failed to come together.  They try explaining what the premise is, but it just doesn't work out.  In the end, something weird happens and...I don't know.  The pacing of this anime is very bad and the explanation of what is happening is even worse.  For the last few episodes, my mind went blank trying to comprehend what the hell I just watched.  Yes, this anime is funny in a sense of the word, but it just really falls short as one of those animes that needed some more time.  Like...seriously.  For anyone who's watched this, can you explain to me?  Did god really exist in that anime or what?  For anyone who wants to take this blob of insanity and manna into consideration, it's best advised to turn your brain off and just watch, cause I can guarantee you, nothing will come together or make sense.

This series made me cry. Its a really nice series showing the development between teachers and students, as well as students with other students. 
The story does not only revolve around one particular set of class but others who once treats them as nothing. You get to see the sense of rivalry. 
Characters are further developed which made things more enjoyable. You get to see why things occurred and one is related to the other.  
Art and sound fit quite well with the series, which was probably one of the reasons which made me like this series.  
All in all, i definitely enjoyed this series. it had a good flow, atmosphere, and feel to it which prevented me from stopping.

With the new Berserk series airing, I felt that it would be appropriate to write this. That, and the fact that I only finished this series today. 
Berserk is based on the manga of the same name and mainly covers the Golden Age arc (around volumes ----). I will compare to the manga where appropriate, but there are parts not portrayed in the anime to save time. 
There is a reason why the source manga is one of the most highly regarded dark fantasy series to ever come into existence. It's carried by a dark and atmospheric world filled by creepy and beautifully drawn demons and fleshed out characters. 
The story follows Guts, a warrior, and his time with a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk, mainly focusing on his interactions and relationship with Griffith; the charismatic leader and Casca; a female squad commander of the mercenary band. While Guts is clearly the main character of the manga, the Golden Age (the arc shown in the anime) has a heavy focus on Griffith, and I quickly found myself caring far more about him than Guts.  
Guts, the Black Swordsman, is a towering man (think an ever-so-slightly leaner Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan) who wields a massive sword and possesses godlike skills in battle. Unfortunately, he doesn't have much in terms of character as he spends the Golden Age 'finding himself' and seeking a purpose or goal, leading to him, well, not doing a whole lot beyond cutting down countless foes. 
Griffith is a clever portrayal of the classic white-knight, a symbol of purity and nobility and a juxtaposition to Guts. And while Griffith certainly has the looks (flowing white hair, white armor and steed, compared to Guts' short black hair and darker armor) and the smooth tongue, his character runs far deeper than that. His character is also opposite to Guts in terms of personality. While Guts seems to wander aimlessly, Griffith has his dream of glory explored as well as his values and morality. His conviction to his dream is a major part of his character and the lengths he is willing to go to in order to advance it is explored greatly. His intelligence, cunning and personal beliefs are put on display and he frequently takes the spotlight whenever he appears, his elegant words and striking appearance snatching your attention. I would go so far as to say that the anime is more about him and his journey to achieve glory than it is about Guts. 
The only other character I'll cover is a side character named Adon Coborlwitz. He isn't particularly notable in terms of story, but I'm including him because he sticks out like a sore thumb. He frequently bears much of the comic relief in the show. He has a very typical 'dumb bad guy' personality, loaded with arrogance and melodrama, and he just seems out of place, often taking away from the immersion in such a serious world. 
The story is interesting, particularly as Griffith nears his goal through pitched battles and manipulation of those around him. His clever plays are great to watch and are a highlight of the show, aside from the vicious deaths of course. The themes of destiny, belonging and ambition are all well explored through the story and characters. While there is a bit of a lull in the middle of the show over a couple of episodes which slow down the pace, the story is great overall. 
Unfortunately, the art fails to bring the wonderfully freakish demons from the manga to life. In fact, the art and animation is Berserk's greatest weakness. The most immediately noticeable flaw is the mediocre art. While the age is obvious (the grainy look of lower resolution production in the --s), this isn't a problem for me, but can be for others. However, it is undeniable that the art is often pretty low quality, with characters often looking roughly drawn or lacking detail. While close-ups are usually pretty good, characters in the mid or background often look very samey or bland. Many lines also look poor, with lines creating muscles looking unnatural, almost like a draft. The flaws in animation are most prevalent in pitched battle scenes. While it having a constantly moving battle scene would be very expensive to animate, it is noticeable that while two characters in the foreground face off, the characters supposedly involved in their own tussles do not move at all. This is made all the worse when it's a mid-shot of the characters at the forefront, leaving a quite clear view of the would-be chaos around them, with sounds of battle cries and clashing swords, except that nobody moves at all. On the plus side, the panning views of scenery look like paintings, similar to Ghibli films, but much less concerned with raw detail, and more concerned with a very artistic feel. It looks very different from the art style throughout the other scenes, but I didn't find it a problem. The lack of quality in the art also means that the visceral detail in the violence and gore that you see in the manga is lacking in the anime. While the violence is certainly there, don't expect to see any gore besides splatters or sprinkler sprays of blood. No intestines, not severed limbs being paraded around. The backgrounds are usually quite good, especially at the very end during the Eclipse scene. The main characters are all very distinguishable, while the nobodies and cannon-fodder are indistinct, seems kind of odd, seeing as the differences can be attributed to the main cast being a band of mercenaries and not an official outfit, but then the rest of the unnamed mercs look exactly the same. But, they look pretty good, so its not much of a complaint, and the other military battalions each look different in accordance to their namesake (such as the White Tiger knights having a distinct stripe pattern over their armor, the Purple Rhino knights having helmets in the shape of a rhinoceros head, etc.). Another minor complaint is the inconsistency in the size of both people and objects. Mainly, Guts' sword seems to change size, from being similar height to himself, to significantly greater, and the height of certain characters in relation to each other seems to shift occasionally. Fortunately, many of the fights, mainly those involving Guts are well fairly well animated (at least Guts and his opponent(s)) and quite exciting (at least if you enjoy watching a lone man mow down dozens of enemies). 
The voice acting seemed pretty good, with the exception of one character (Adon Coborlwitz) who sounds very exaggerated and comical (while this is intentional to fit his character, his character itself seems almost jarringly out of place in the show). The opening theme has a poor sounding guitar that seems out of tune. In fact the opening sounds a lot more lighthearted than the dark and brutal world of Berserk, but the song eventually grew on me, and I can't say that I dislike it. The other themes used in the show are pretty great, ranging from being poignant to stirring and fitting within the atmosphere and world created by the show, with Guts' main theme being particularly good. The battle sounds aren't particularly special, but they're appropriate and certainly don't fail in any regard. However, certain sound effects are poorly synched with the animation occurring on the screen. There are a few scenes where a character is walking with a wooden crutch, but the sound effect of the crutch hitting the ground is off from how he appears to be walking. There is also a scene where the main character charges into battle with a savage war cry...except his mouth is closed. Fortunately, these moments are pretty rare and aren't that big a deal.  
Overall, if you can get past the lacking visuals, Berserk is an absolute must for those seeking a dark and violent fantasy world with great characters and story. Griffith is one of the best written characters I've come across and is mesmerizing in his persona. How much he carries this show cannot be understated. The one-on-one fights are nice and exhilarating and the soundtrack is commendable.  If you haven't read the manga/ watched the movies and don't know what happens, I recommend skipping the first episode ad watching it last as it kind of spoils what happens at the end.

In one paragraph, here's a review from someone who watched Naruto as a newbie but is now a relatively experienced anime fan: 
Naruto is the first anime that I ever watched. Sure - it's not like any of the current mainstream anime (under -- episodes). It doesn't have the intellectual intensity, dynamic story line, quick and intense character development, and other factors are common in all great anime today. It's quite long at some times, there are some annoying fillers, and its been going on for over -- years. But, at least for me, that is what makes it great! See, spending time on this show, watching the characters actually grow as time passes, enjoying the strong moments and sobering through the sad ones is what makes this show appealing to so many young people across the world. Naruto has all the elements of an anime meant to show the beauty of life - not to delve into an intellectual or emotional rollercoaster. I might even say that some of the important decisions that I have made in life may have been inspired by this show.  
Undoubtedly, I will continue to watch Naruto, Boruto, or whatever comes despite how good or useless it is - think of this as a testament to what this show means to me and so many others.

Too sum it up, the anime is like a pretty candy that leaves disgusting aftertaste.  
In my opinion it really doesn't matter how wonderful the art is if the plot is pathetic. And in this anime the plot is pathetic, it is so very boring and predictable. There is absolutely nothing to think about, just a collection of pretty pictures. The worst part is you get hooked and watch the next episode because you want to find something interesting and mysterious to think about, but the next episode is just random dialog and flashy scenes.

Personally I think this movie is very overrated. I've only heard good things about it and it was nice to come here and see at least a few other people agreed with me. 
In terms of characters, they weren't that great. Sophie was nothing special and was very plain, and Howl isn't really as beautiful of a character as he was supposed to be. There relationship also wasn't that great, it was basically love at first sight which I can kind of let slide considering in a - hour movie there isn't really a lot of time to develop a relationship, but it was basically just Sophie looks at him, he looks at her, and they're deeply in love. There could've been some better development. 
The plot also left me scratching my head wondering what happened. Nothing was really explained as well as it should have been, and I was left wondering why things were happening and what was going on. I'm sure the book explains everything in detail, but the movie didn't even make an attempt. 
Overall I didn't really enjoy it. Other than the art there wasn't much I really enjoyed. The story was underdeveloped and the characters were forgettable. I'm a fan of Studio Ghibli, but this is definitely my least favourite movie by them.

There are few animated movies in my opinion that can make you fully connect emotionally with characters and the story in an hour and -- minutes but this is one! 
The only con I would say is the plot can be hard to follow bc of the multiple time jumps and the idea of time travel.  
But the character development is amazing, especially for a movie. I would say that this is a true coming of age movie with just the right amount of comedy to keep things light but also dramatic enough that you keep watching. I cannot explain how intricate the plot is but isn't EXTREMELY difficult to understand if you pay attention.  
The other characters have good screen time without interfering with the main plot which I really liked. Plus there was a simple unraveling of romantic feelings which was nice and thoroughly well done. 
The idea of fate and that ""red string of fate"" in Japanese fiction is very popular and a popular story to tell - how two characters are connected somehow in an intricate way. I would say though that this is by far one of my top three movies that has done it right.  
The ending did me dirty and the soundtrack is absolute gold as well. It was just done so nicely and left me crying sad and happy tears.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sometimes you are better off leaving your expectations low and not getting enraptured into something too quickly. For someone that has watched a lot of television and film, I still haven’t broken the habit of brushing my cynicism aside when I see something exceptionally well made. Whether it be the first episode of Kill la Kill, which is vibrant, eccentric, and perfectly paced, or the hook in Nichijou, as we witness a well-known anime cliché get upturned in its opening sequence, setting lofty expectations for the series. The point here is, when a show gives you everything in its opening, you either buy into it or don’t. It shapes the future of the product for the viewer. Next time you sit down to consume an anime, try and pay attention to the way it attempts to hook you. How does that introduction affect your outlook on the rest of the episode? 
Hinamatsuri fits snuggly with the “load-blowers” of the industry; clearly wanting to showcase an especially impressive fight sequence that was not only exceptionally animated but solidly funny as well.  A sporadic, nimble cut filled with substantial smears and smooth frames. It instantly captured me. Unfortunately, it peaked right then, for nothing else in the series reached that level of entertainment. I can’t help but feel as though I would’ve enjoyed it more if my expectations weren’t taken through a proverbial lap dance only to get a high-heel to the nads. 
That’s not to say that Hinamatsuri is bad. It just doesn’t really attempt to be anything it established past the first episode. We meet Nitta, a Yakuza member who finds a metallic pod in his home with an odd girl trapped at the center of it. That girl is Hina. Her origins are unknown. We do quickly figure out she’s a bit of deadpan brat with telekinetic powers. From there, Nitta proceeds to unwillingly take care of her in continuously absurd situations as he makes use of her powers, her naivete, and their general relationship stays at a comfortable medium between hating each other and genuinely loving each other.  
Hinamatsuri proceeds to introduce a decent secondary cast. A second, power-infused girl with Anzu, who gets left in our strange world as she tries to make ends meet with a bunch of homeless men, and Mishima, a classmate of Hina who gets thrust into a bartending job while still in elementary school. The idea here is that every character must face a situation firmly out of their comfort zone. Nitta, who is somewhat of a lady’s man and rogue, living alone in his apartment, is forced to become a pseudo-parent. Anzu needs to learn about this alien world and survive. Mishima must adapt to the new job she was burdened with. Each one has a miniature arc and plenty of B-stories. Some work, others resoundingly don’t.  
The show is at its best when it is shooting the shit. Mishima is constantly the most entertaining character, not because she’s well-written, mind you, but simply because the situations she’s put in are farcical and almost always comedy-oriented. Meanwhile, Anzu, who is stuck living with homeless people, must go through a less-funny and more saccharine arc, as she deals with loss and growth. Her arc is perhaps the show at its weakest, as I found myself cringing at the overly-sugary emotions that were not only undeserved but completely dissonant from the appeal of the series to me.  
Hina and Nitta are well-balanced enough. One moment they hate each other, another moment they have a connection. It isn’t perfect, but it is serviceable. With above-average animation for TV anime, Hinamatsuri elevates its presentation just enough to retain my interest. Unfortunately, the character designs are boring, to put it kindly. If I were in a worse mood I’d easily call them flat-out ugly. This doesn’t do too much to detract from the series, however, the generally serviceable animation, when compared to other shows of its ilk, is truly the only stand-out element in the presentation. Everything else in Hinamatsuri, from directing to shot-composition is uninspired, to say the least.  
Peaking so early didn’t do it any favors, either, as the initial spectacle wears off and we get what I can only call a slightly above average slice of life. The comedy here is passable for anime, a medium which seriously struggles to be funny on its best day. The characters are generally unmemorable barring a few situations they find themselves in. Particularly earlier on the series before the character dynamics began feeling repetitive. There were flashes of inspiration in the general malaise, what with Hina begging Nitta to go to a “girl’s club”, and Mishima’s journey through unwilling student to a professional bartender. It was a positive experience, if only barely. I see copious praise for a series that does the bare minimum to stand-out from the crowd, but honestly, for a medium that loves repetition so much, maybe that’s enough.

/////THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
First review! yays 
I decided to write this review as of episode -, the point at which I lost all interest I had in this anime. This thing is one of the most frustrating things I've ever watched, and it's closely battling with ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" for the first place in the category of worst anime I've somehow managed to finish. And I will elaborate my opinions as it follows, one part at a time. 
Story: -/--  
I am going to do something that the creators of KnK were unable to accomplish in what concerns the storyline, which is explaining things. I don't even know where to begin with this. 
The plot? Where the fuck is it? Plot holes are one thing, but this is ridiculous. I was too angry trying to understand why what is happening is happening instead of enjoying the kind of overused but fairly potent overall concept of this anime. It had so many ""BECAUSE ANIME"" moments, I had to take up a notebook at episode - and start writing them down.  
This anime was so uninteresting it became the handsfree activity I would do while eating, rather than the show you would grab food to watch.  
That one filler episode with the fruit monster who squirted smelly juice kept me alert, nonetheless. What. The. Fuck. This episode was a big fuck-up by content, but the ending was striving for cheap old american sitcom endings where the characters get dragged back into the humorous but troublesome situation due to their collective stupidity which only adds to the comedic effect.  Ha. Ha. No.  
And who needs a filler for a -- episode anime? Comedy was trying to be shoved in by force anyway and the behaviour of the characters was just questionable.  
Here's a selection of these ""thought-inducing"" BECAUSE ANIME scenes: 
-at some point, the water in the sewers two characters were fighting in caught fire BECAUSE ANIME 
-main girl finds STACKS of albums with photos of her in the main dude's apartment but also finds a hint for her upcoming birthday present that would clearly only feed the guy's maniacal glasses fetish but still, she is stricken by romance, completely disregarding the creepiness BECAUSE ANIME 
-main dude aggressively rides the scooter through the snow, on a background of unfitting battle music 
At episode --, I could have stopped watching it and everything would have been fine, because the focus was so heavy on the romance between the two, the plot and the existence of the other characters were actually ditched completely. It really did feel like the anime ended right there. Which would have made the series better, in my opinion. 
Art: -/--  
The design does look pretty but nothing unusual, really. Too pretty and ""slice of life"" for what it's trying to be, in my opinion. 
The animation is mediocre, except for that one episode where they randomly included motion-capture for the dance of the characters. Not very aesthetic. 
Sound: -/-- 
Mediocre. Mediocre. Mediocre. Sometimes even unfitting (refer to the list of questionable scenes in the Story section). 
Characters: -/-- 
They were flat, inconsistent and their behaviour made no sense at all in certain situations.  
We have the moe, shy protagonist, Mirai Kuriyama who has a blog and becomes omgbadass when challenged even though she has proven to be completely useless in previous stress situations. Yet Mirai's concept is overall interesting, as ""teh gurl wif sord frum blud"", but her personality could have been shaped better than that of a cute rodent with bipolar predator unexplained outbursts. 
There are two perverts in this anime, BECAUSE ANIME. One of them, Akihito Kanbara, has an eyeglasses fetish and a mom who sends him hologram cards, changes the colours of her eyes with every skimpy outfit she wears without a reason, and has some sort of fulltime job as a furry prostitute. Besides that and their mother-son relationship where they chose to make even moments like him beating her and her yelling about abuse humorous, there is really nothing else to this character. Oh yes, and he is half-human half-shade BECAUSE ANIME. 
If that guy was disturbing enough, the other pervert, Hiroomi Nase, gut-clenchingly, has a little sister fetish. And he also has a fetish for his little sister. Incest is so humorous! But as if that was not enough, he must be part of this family of cool cats, where his older sister, Izumi, is overpowered for no reason -pretty much like Mikasa from Snk-, and his little sister, Mitsuki, is stereo-typically a tsundere for her older perverted brother. Yet, they all act superior, their arrogance being directly proportional with their age. 
Then there are filler characters, like the cat-girl and the traditionally-dressed lady who both had shapeshifting abilities BECAUSE ANIME, the creepy guy who just appears and is creepy (and sometimes explains things without a reason to no audience whatsoever), the teacher who likes to drink and has relationship problems, and Sakura. The traditionally-dressed lady also had some vast knowledge of what was going on and could turn into the mammal version of a nine-tailed leupluredon, again, because you know why. 
Sakura was probably the most annoying character in this anime. She was playing the role of the mandatory quiet character who never has emotions, except she also spontaneously tackles people feet-first like a fucking retard. She had about three moments in the anime where she acted kind, warm and friendly and none of them were explained so I am only guessing she is supposed to have some unexplained mental illness. Justifiable by the fact that all the people she cares about being either taken away from her or dying while everyone else disregards her almost completely. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Mostly frustration. I tried to make it seem interesting since it is so short, but I could not. 
Overall: -/-- 
This anime is a couple of shards of good ideas in a container of -- episodes that is then stuffed with cotton filling just for it to be there. Essentially, this anime remained in the concept stage and published that way, without any work put into developing the story or the characters whatsoever. It tries to be a dozen different genres at the same time, while virtually doing nothing useful with the amount of time it has.  
The frustration factor is the high potential this series has despite minor unoriginal aspects, and how much half-assery got mixed in to create something superficially aesthetic but of no substance.

After watching the first episodes I thought it's gonna be a good anime though the animation wasn't that good but this anime wasted my time 
The main characters hiro and zero two were sucked, at one point I wanted to stop watching it but mitsuru's love story was good. This anime is a pure waste of time and I don't reccommend to watch it  
but If you are with the main character who uses you to become human though she knew you may die and hurts your friends. Zero two is a b***h. she only does lame stand up. 
The story of mitsuru and kokori was small but it was nice

First off, I watched the dubbed version of this, not the subbed. So if you watched the dubbed version, prepare to be a bit confused by the accents used by the characters. Two of the characters are supposed to be foreign (and from the same place), but they have accents from two different places (one from Germany, the other from Russia). Other than that, you can sort of see things coming, and nothing was a surprise. There's also a few arc's that go no where. Nothing comes to a conclusion. The ending could have been dragged out a bit longer for emotional effect... Thankfully it was a happy ending. Just not that great of a series.

I loved this anime and I don't understand why people are rating it low or giving it bad reviews. The character animation and art is simply one of the best i've ever seen. It has a decent story too though i'll admit it seems a bit rushed near the end. It's the best super power anime i've ever watched and I believe it's terribly under-rated. The character development is great and the action fits the story perfectly unlike soe anime which have needless action and fighting. It fits   
a lot of genres and creates a well balanced overall story. The characters are lovable and you'll get immediately attached to them. If you lijed this one then be sure to check out Angel Beats.

Now I loved mushishi.I thought it was clever,emotional,beautiful and philosophical all at the same time. This series came out in ---- and now that in ---- a special and a second season were announced I was very excited. It took me a while to get to but I am finally starting my crusade to watch all of the fairly new mushishi content we have been presented with.But enough of my rambling now onto the review.Mushishi Special: Hihamukage is a -- minute special and is the kickstart to the slew of mushishi content to grace us in ----. So what makes this special so amazing? Well it starts with what made mushishi amazing and is condensed into a -- minute special. The story is great with Ginko up to his same antics, the side characters are still well developed despite there short appearance, the plot still has good depth and intrigue, the themes are smartly intergrated to make the show more special, and the art and music are both great. There isn't much more to say, if you loved mushishi like I did watch it. It's -- minutes there's no reason not to. And now I'm very excited to watch both seasons of zoku shou and the movie. But for real in conclusion if you loved mushishi and want to get into all of the new content like I do,I recommend starting with this one,because it truly captures the same atmosphere and wonder as it did almost a decade ago.

When i saw randomly surfing the web that Hayate season - came out i was happy and delighted . 
But after reading that this not continueation but more of different story i was shocked . The story became more of RANDOM SH*T  Art became slightly worse sound well became a little better character from one point better from other worser but mainly Hayate(only character not Anime) changed to the better . I don't enjoy watching this rubbish but i will for i don't wan't to read manga.  I guess it was disappointing to me that season - ended with so much mystery's well atleast i don't see any pedophile romance with nagi and hayate. Yet still Hayate became more of Supporting role . Maybe this because of my age or maybe I'm right but this anime became more childish with stupid jokes etc. Like I said i wan't story development not random comdey with slice of life THERE ARE TONS OF ANIMES LIKE THAT

Let me start this review by saying I've seen every episode that has been aired for both Naruto (completed) and Naruto Shippuden (currently) and yes that also includes fillers. 
*Now I understand that not everyone is going to have the same opinion as me but the entire Naruto franchise will always have a dear place in my heart and here's why: 
Story: The story line for Naruto Shippuden is a lot different from Naruto, but it is equally great. Once you get past the infinite amount of filler, or decide to skip them, it is clear that although Sasuke's retrieval makes up most of the adventures, there is just SO MUCH MORE to follow along with. Naruto Shippuden can have you crying, laughing, stressed and angry all in the course of one episode.  
Characters: My oh my how they have changed. All of the characters have grown so much and even Kiba is likable haha. 
Here are two examples: 
Naruto came back a whole new person. Literally. His outfit is upgraded, his maturity has somewhat increased, and so has his height ;) 
Sakura: one of my favorite characters is clearly no longer ""useless"". I love her but I have to admit, she did not have much to contribute to Part - but now... If you haven't caught up to at least episode ---, your in for a treat! 
Overall Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, the movies, the manga, everything is ---% enjoyable and if you decide to stick with it to the end, you'll be in for a treat

Ah, first review, here we come! (There might be a few spoilers) 
Kaiba is not your typical anime. From the unorthodox way of animation, to the strange, confusing (but brilliant) storyline, it breaks the mold for anime you'd probably typically watch. There are virtually no characters that fall into the groups of typical anime stereotypes (yandere, tsundere) and the anime introduces interesting sci-fi concepts that we probably could never imagine ourselves, which brings out the amazing originality of this piece of art (I mean anime). 
Kaiba's basic storyline starts off in a world where memories can be manipulated and swapped and bodies can be interchangeable, meaning you can freely delete bad memories and replace them with good ones, and implant them into another body. We find the main protagonist (Kaiba) inside a crumbling white room, with no memory of who he is or why he is there. Before he can ask any of these questions, he finds himself being chased by what seemed to be an over sized hairdryer. After narrowly escaping it, he embarks on the journey to regain his memories, traveling from many planets and meeting many people along the way. 
Story: -- 
The story was brilliantly laid out. From the beginning to the end, it Kaiba kept me hooked to my computer screen. The paciing was to the point of near perfection, letting us sympathize with Kaiba, while letting us view and immerse ourselves in his futuristic world. Bits of the plot are leaked out slowly, making you wonder what is happening and why, driving you to finish the series. Eventually though, all these pieces of the plot you'll find can interconnect, and the true brilliance of 
the story is revealed. 
Art: - 
It's like something out of a Salvador Dalli painting. The background environment is amazing and complex, with very interesting depictions of strange animals and fiery suns. Nearly everything is coloured for its situation, with poor places painted very dully and plain, whereas aquatic theme parks are bright with many hues of blue and yellow. The characters design, though different from what I'd regularly see out of an anime, was still pleasing to the eye, as the characters seemed to be drawn more circularly.  
Sound: - 
The OP and ED were very memorable (if not engrishy). Most of the background music enhanced the environment, and basically emulated the senses. Overall, the sound was very well done. 
Characters: -- 
This is probably the best part of this anime. All the characters have diverse personalities and goals, which gives each of them a strong sense of individuality. 
Sometimes, you'll have some misconceptions of some characters, take Popo. You first find him aiding Kaiba to the spaceship, giving him the sense that he is an ally. Then we find he is a member of the Issoudan, a group to kill the king of memories (really Kaiba, but Warp occupies the throne). Here we find he has traits of an arrogant and bloodthirsty antagonist, with no mercy to Kaiba/Warp or anyone who betrays the Issoudan. We only find in the  latter episodes his real intention in to find a body for the memories of his mother,  giving him sympathy and reasoning for his actions., putting him back in to his neutral stance, and renewing some sympathy for him. 
Overall, it was an awesome ride. and I recommend you watch it. Now.

This show doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be so it left it so that it could be any kind of show. You find out that it is an isekai and that the entire class was transported, but you dont see the actual isekai event. It is like playing an rpg where someone else has played the first few levels for you and you are just continuing from there.  
Story is horribly done including the attempts at comedy and fanservice. 
The art is below average. 
The characters don't feel unique. Especially the main characters.  
The best way that I can describe this anime is that someone is trying to take their favorite parts of all the anime they have watched and put it all together, but they also missed several details 
This is an isekai that is so poorly done that I created an account to leave this review so that others don't waste their time.

There are countless questions that people often ask themselves such as: why do we exist, where do we go after we die and most importantly why is ""Shitcom"" an anime and why did I want to watch this - minute and - seconds of pure and utter trash? 
I'll refrain myself from making any puns and I will say just one thing: it at least manages to do what the title implies, no not the ""com"", which suggests that there would be comedy in this -- minute short (Spoiler alert: there's nothing funny, unless you're - years old or you need help in identifying what's a good ""dumb"" joke and what is a bad ""dumb"" joke), but the ""Shit"" part. And there's plenty of it. The ""joke"" is structured as follows: the couple are at a fancy dinner at a restaurant, the woman's stomach starts rumbling and then the guy shows her a ring, with the intention of them getting married. The ""punchline"" is upon seeing the ring, from excitement the woman, I kid you not, starts crapping herself... from her mouth... and then the man follows suit. Jesus Christ... 
I never thought the day would come that I'd rate something a - out of -- since I try to rate what I enjoyed even if it's a bad series, nor that I would be so mad that I would write a - paragraph long review about something so insignificant, but here we are. I just can't be asked anymore.

This is my first time writing a review, and it's because this anime is worth a review. **Little to no spoilers** 
Story: -- 
This isn't your typical guy-meets-girl shoujo. It's about a weak girl who was betrayed by her loved one, and was kicked out of the palace. Now, she has to survive in the outside world--which is very different from the life she had in the castle. It's a mix of a lot of things: adventure, comedy, fantasy and a bit of romance. They also know how to balance the comedy and the serious scenes. The pacing was not too slow, and not too fast either.  
Art: -- 
The art was amazing. All of the characters and background were well-drawn. The art had an ""anime feel"" to it. The art wasn't so realistic, as to question whether you're watching an anime or a drama. The character designs were unique, and it suited the characters well. For example, the colour of their hair actually gives an idea of what they are (e.g. White Dragon=White Hair). 
Sound: - 
You don't see(or rather, hear) instrumental openings everyday. The first OP was peaceful, I can't complain about it. But the second OP made me feel like there was something wrong with my headphones, when I first listened to it. I think it grew on me, but I still prefer the first OP. The first ED was kind of too emotional(and slow) for me, therefore I prefer the second ED. Actually, ""prefer"" is the wrong word. I loved the second ED. It really screamed ""Akatsuki no Yona"". It was calm, and yet adventurous. It fits the anime very well. 
Character: -- 
The characters were all well-developed that you'll find it hard to pick a favourite. All the characters were lovable (Yes, even the villain.). I find it really hard to hate the villain. He was such a cool and gentle character, but I guess people are all entitled to their opinions. The interactions between the characters are all so cute, it made me smile at my computer screen. 
Enjoyment: -- 
I wouldn't have written a review if it wasn't enjoyable. I haven't watched a good anime in a long time. A good anime in my opinion has to have a good story-line, and good art. This is one of those animes.

This show reminds me a lot of Ready Player One. It has a bunch of cool nostalgia and references. It also has a main character that will annoyingly explain the reference to the audience, just to make sure you know that the show made a reference. 
The story is simple, an arcade otaku meets the most perfectest and popularest girl in his school at an arcade and loses to her in street fighter -. This sparks an almost one sided rivalry between the two which blossoms into something more, as the show goes on. I found the story a little better than the generic romance anime.  
This show is pretty ugly though. The backgrounds are flat and boring. The characters are all cg with not much animation. The cg was probably used to make the characters feel different from the video games. However, there are also tons of animation shortcuts, whether it's using game footage to pad the run-time or long pauses that would make 'One Piece' jealous. So something tells me that cg was not used as an artistic choice but as a cheap one.  
The sound design is good in the show. The op and ed are a little bland but the in background music and the arcade sounds are done adequately. No real complaints there. 
The characters are the worst part of the show for me, specifically the two mains. The main boy Yaguchi, is the type of MC that never stops talking. He is constantly inner monologuing and explaining what is happening on the screen. You could probably get a good understanding of the main plot if you watched this show blindfolded. The Main girl Oono (which im just now realizing is a street fighter reference) on the other hand, never speaks. The best you get, is grunting and sighing. On top of not speaking, she also has almost no facial expressions or personality. This means she is whatever the MC and the viewer wants to imprint on her. She has two defining traits. She is good at literally everything and she is afraid of scary things. THAT'S IT. There is also the third MC who is the -rd wheel on this love triangle. She is clearly the one the viewer should root for, as she has character motivation and development.  
Overall, my enjoyment of the show was weird. It was an easy watch and it had its good episodes mixed in the series. Actually, my favorite episode was when the MC and Secondary love interest get left behind on a school field trip and spend the whole day just hanging out. However, with annoying, very cheap cg characters on top of an average story and hit or miss comedy, I don't think I'd recommend this unless you just want to see some old --s games get referenced.

Where in the world do I begin with this train wreck of a movie?  
The plot is the essentially a clone of other Final Fantasy movies and has more or less the same story arc we've all seen a thousand times before in sci-fi and anime. What makes all those other countless identical films superior to this one is exposition. Flashbacks, memories, narrative storytelling, correlated events - all of these are what give a tale depth and interest. Sadly, none of that is seen here, just a series of events given in one block of time. The closest we ever come to any dimension added to the characters are the little tidbits they happen to drop in conversation with others. However, without compelling imagery, the words are just as flat as the script on which they were written. 
The one saving grace is the CG artwork, which was crisp, defined, and of good enough quality. Again, though, the ""phantoms"" practically had generic written all over them. Less-than-material creatures that glow a lot and eat spirits - anyone else getting a little déjà-vu yet? 
So, once again, the amazing video game franchise is slightly cheapened with another badly made movie. It would have been just another mediocre bit for the masses, but unfortunately, every other film-maker did it first, and every other film-maker did it better.

(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!) 
It’s my hope to be a grandfather someday. 
My own Grandpa turned -- years old this week. I called him up on the phone to tell him happy birthday and to see how he has been doing. We talked about my job, his thoughts, and just life in general. To him, he’s most grateful for a simple yet important thing: his family. 
From his wife to his siblings, from his kids to his grandkids and great grandkids, he is proud to know that his legacy is one filled with amazing people. Good people. And I’m lucky enough to be a part of the love that he shares. 
Alice to Zouroku isn’t about birthdays and legacies, but it is about a relationship that spans a couple of generations. Sadly, whatever love it does have to share is lost along the way. 
STORY 
It takes watching all of Alice to Zouroku to realize that its narrative construction isn’t exactly linear. Not in the one-event-after-another sense but in the how-it-coalesces sense. Because, at first, it seems as though the show will follow a strict, singular plotline. Instead, it goes for separate arcs and episodic content, jumbling together both approaches to achieve its story. 
If this content were half-arc-half-episodic or fully one or the other, then the anime would have had some merit, following through on a foundation or keeping consistent in its plot. Instead, this jumbling comes off as the anime having little to no focus. Many of the people in the first half do not carry over: Minnie C., the director dude, that one kid who can draw items into existence. Much of what goes on in the second half doesn’t tie back too well: Hatori’s dilemma, the explanation of her powers, the newfound government watch program. And sandwiched in-between are the show’s episodic morsels. 
Not that the two slices of bread on either side of the season are completely inedible. Sanae and Sana’s interactions in the second episode make for a fun, lively sequence of events that push the plot along while building the cast. And the exploration of Wonderland in the final couple of episodes, after it had been alluded to here and there for quite some time, demonstrates a follow through on Alice to Zouroku’s part. 
Still, the breads’ moldy focus heavily curtails the show’s most important aspect: Sana and Zouroku’s relationship. With the initial outing worried mostly about a research facility and the evil people chasing Sana, and with the last outing putting a ridiculous amount of emphasis on a couple of last-minute characters, there just isn’t enough time given to what the anime literally titles itself around. 
That’s why, when these moments between the old grandpa and the young granddaughter do pop up, they immediately capture the audience’s attention. It can be something as small as him pulling open a wrapper around some candy for her to eat or as big as her clinging onto and refusing to let go of him when he gets back home safe and sound. No matter the scale, their grounded moments together represent Alice to Zouroku at its absolute best. 
Indeed, all of episode six – with her tagging along during his job, their intermittent conversations, and her eventual adoption – make this aforementioned morsel the tastiest of the bunch. It can even be argued that the very, very last scene also deserves such praise. An older Sana fondly reminisces about Zouroku in a future timeline while clutching a set of beautiful flowers that no doubt remind her of him. The thematic implications alone here make this snippet infinitely more interesting than whatever the first and second halves of the show dished out. If for no other reason than it actually relates to the anime’s main goal. 
Besides the strange lack of focus, the anime contains even stranger decisions. Sana’s kidnapping isn’t so much shocking in an entertaining sense as it is downright uncomfortable to watch given how over-the-top the anime goes with it (when she soils herself, the potential drugging, literally shooting her in the leg with subsequent muffled screams and cries). Moreover, one of the story’s themes on humanizing remains restricted to the Dreams of Alice users as opposed to explored and contrasted through regular people as well. And, speaking of the Dreams of Alice, the premise never truly takes hold, acting more as a caveat to the narrative rather than a vital piece worth extra attention. 
A lot of the comedy does work in the anime’s favor thanks mostly to Sana’s inquisitiveness. Plus, to reiterate, her moments with Zouroku demonstrate that this story has heart. But, without tangible storytelling focus and with those few speedbumps along the way, the show’s total execution rots more than it would prefer. 
ART & ANIMATION 
Alice to Zouroku’s first episode spells doom for the series when it trips up with error after error in its artistry. Asynchronous audiovisual production when a character sounds like he sits down and sighs but not really. Low-quality CG all over. Moving backgrounds when the characters themselves have stopped. Improper detail locations. While none of these specific issues exist for any longer than a few seconds at most, their frequency raises a red flag immediately for the rest of the show’s artistic integrity. 
Thankfully, the flag lowers quite a bit once moved beyond the first episode. Yes, the CG is still not ideal when it does appear, but it isn’t around as much or at least as prominently. And yea, the rare weird cut can rear its ugly head, like when Zouroku moves to attack Minnie C. for harming Sana. But, in general, the anime doesn’t wave that flag around with vigor anymore afterwards. 
Instead, Alice to Zouroku likes to draw one’s attention to the effort put into the designs of its characters. Their blocky nature adds some much needed charm to this story, and their looks capture their personalities well. 
For example, Zouroku’s furrowed gaze, white beard, and red sweater paint him as a stern yet likable grandpa. Sana switches from a princess dress and crown to a hoodie and short hair without ever losing her blonde strands and pink coloring, giving her a childish, cute appearance with ease. And Shizuku’s business attire contrasts with her magical maid outfit to complement work with “play” and to help accentuate her doubly helpful behavior. 
Sana’s Wonderland and the background artistry also deserve some praise. Her world away from the world contains all manner of depicted oddities: flying seals, giant turtles, crazy technology, piano bridges, shoe plants, ducky boats on a tea river. All it’s missing is a loony (read: mad) guy with a hat and some cards. 
The background art in Wonderland wows with its blue skies, pink clouds, and levitating isles. But the local city, Zouroku’s pretty floral shop, and the smaller locations visited (his house, the alley restaurant) also do their part in building the show’s appeal. 
By comparison, Alice to Zouroku’s actual animation does not reach as high as the designs and the background art, but it does not reach as low as the first episode’s wary mistakes either. Instead, it treads a middle ground. The characters’ imaginative summons, like Shizuku’s array of “weapons”, up movement for the duration of their stay, and the everyday actions of the characters don’t scream fluidity but get the job done regardless. 
That red flag never leaves the mind of the audience because of the stark nature of the errors committed. However, with the nice designs, pretty backgrounds, and passable animation, the show at least tries to hide that flag as best as it can. 
CHARACTERS 
Of the two main characters in Alice to Zouroku, Sana evidently earns the most screen time. 
Without knowing anything about her, Sana seems like any other child. She pines after tasty food she cannot afford. She isn’t afraid to state her honest opinion despite the situation. She loves to have fun without worrying about the consequences. Yes, she has her own personal quirks, like commenting on the smells around her and singing made-up songs any chance she gets. But she’s no doubt like any other kid through and through. 
At least, until one discovers that there’s more to her than meets the eye. As a sentient Dream of Alice, Sana isn’t human. She’s a construct of the people and the emotions she experienced very early on. In other words, not only does she have to mature as a person but also she has to learn what being a person even is to begin with. This double layer of necessary growth for her character gives her experiences throughout the season a meaningful edge twice over and a much more purposeful direction overall. 
So, many of the scenes in Alice to Zouroku that revolve around Sana center on her growth. Much like the craziness of her Wonderland dreamscape, these scenes come in all shapes and sizes. She finds joy in the simple things such as the squeaking of some wooden steps. She learns to apologize when in the wrong. She receives an education and a family to call her own. Incremental steps really, but they go a long way towards putting her on the right path for adulthood and “humanhood.” 
Her relationships with others, while few in number, also contribute to Sana’s growth. The twins act as a fun, recurring remnant from the first part of her life, letting her know that not everything from her past should be forgotten. Hatori, the main “antagonist” of the last arc of the season, is herself not the most compelling character (and honestly not individually relevant to the show), but she does (indirectly) force Sana to refrain from gut reactions and to think about sympathy towards others instead. And Sanae dotes on her as much as she can to give her the love and care she has never experienced before. 
These people are well and good for Sana’s growth, but the most important figure now in her life isn’t a friend or a sibling but (as anyone can guess at this point) a grandparent: Zouroku. 
Known as the man who despises “crooked stuff,” Zouroku is an older fellow whose tough demeanor and worn baseball cap hide the fact that he’s the town’s most proficient florist. He doesn’t take extra handouts from others, and he looks after his employees. In short, his age reflects his steadfast maturity. 
With age also comes wisdom. Zouroku doesn’t care that Sana is technically not human; he simply sees her as a sincere young girl who wants to live a normal life like anybody else. So, in their various scenes together, Sana listens to Zouroku as he passes on his wisdom to her. Be it about the need to lean on others during tough times or being responsible with one’s own power, he is the best role model for her to achieve the growth in character that she requires. 
Zouroku sometimes employs a harsh cranium squeeze to reprimand Sana which goes against his normally calm self, yet those words of his guide her all the same. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have much else going for him. No strong backstory, no outside relationships. In a way, that’s because he’s “been through it all” already, so he (on a life level) does not have much left to gain. Indeed, not only does this whole crazy experience not change him much but also he comes off as oddly unfazed by it all. This direction for his character leaves little room for him in which to express himself, thereby diminishing his presence and his impact within the anime. 
Nevertheless, by the end of the season, Sana has clearly grown. She may become “frazzled” again in the future, but, with the people in her life looking out for her to support her from here on out, she will surely encounter more opportunities and more happiness, too. All to make her life the one she has always dreamed about. 
MUSIC & SOUND 
“Wonder Drive,” the opening track to this show, includes a lot of spacey effects and otherworldly noises to produce its sound. It aligns with the alien nature of the Dreams of Alice, and, for at least this reason, the OP has a leg to stand on. Otherwise, the track fills said space with nothing too out of the ordinary. A clapping segment. Some twang from its guitar and a pattering of drums in the background. Vocals that do not overbear the listener but do not engage them either. Altogether, this track isn’t too interesting, but it works in Alice to Zouroku. 
Its counterpart, however, is a different, better story. Titled “Chant,” the ending track stands on two legs instead, providing music both intriguing and fun to hear. The acoustic guitar, the xylophone, and the chimes blend together into a simplistic yet whimsical sound that entrances one’s ear. As the instrumentation glides along, the main vocalist’s whisper-like lyrical delivery and the supporting background vocals combine to give the song its happy, gentle vibe. Everything coalesces as an awesome track that’s worthy of playing outside of the anime itself. 
Likewise, the original soundtrack also earns props for many of its heartfelt melodies that accompany its scenes. Light piano keys will give way to violin strings that evoke the same swell of emotions. Other times, acoustic guitar plays alongside the piano for a decidedly happier tune. Then singular piano keys will intersperse a warped sound-effect to lightly lay on the tension of a given situation. 
Beyond these piano tracks, Alice to Zouroku also provides different musical pieces that follow different moods and segments. An intentionally stumbling song – with dainty xylophone notes, methodical wind instruments, and lazier pipe sounds – creates an airy atmosphere for the slice-of-life scenes. And the occasional jazz tune, with saxophone and light cymbal tapping, dots the show during certain montage moments. The OST may not stand as tall as the ED, but, melody or no, it stands tall nonetheless throughout the season. 
And not to be ignored, the voice acting involved, while not exactly special, has a couple of examples worthy of pointing out. Hitomi Ohwada as Sana stars in her first major main role, doing well in making Sana not only sound like a young girl but also dabbling into different emotions for her. Not to mention the overall cuteness of her cadence. Likewise, Akio Ootsuka as Zouroku also deserves a shoutout. His gruff tone and respectful anger give his lectures and yells their stern and compassionate edge. 
All in all, with just the OP not leaving too much of a mark on Alice to Zouroku, the music and sound contain some of the best parts to this show even when the other parts available were somewhat of a letdown. 
ENJOYMENT 
My feelings are conflicted on this one. I like it for two specific reasons, and I don’t like it for one specific reason. 
One of those likes goes to Sana. She is curious, silly, and happy-go-lucky. In other words, she’s a really fun kid character. Her impatience causing her to summon a giant pancake during breakfast to demonstrate the law of conversation of energy. Riding a rocket to chase after the twins in a high-speed, high-flying chase. How she talked about the proper way to drink milk. Quite regularly, her antics and reactions got me laughing. 
The other like goes to her relationship with Zouroku, for she cares a lot about this old man who she randomly ran into. She brings him with her into the nighttime sky for a spectacular view of the world below, and she gleefully goes out of her way to try and show him her new bobbed haircut. In turn, his intentions were always sincere, and her happiness while around him was always infectious. 
Which leads to my number one dislike: Hatori. I get that she’s depressed from living in a household where her parents fight and do not value her much. But she got on my nerves very quickly regardless: all of the drama with her powers, being even slightly mean to Sana. Plus, she’s apparently between eight and ten years old, making her adult behavior about her entire situation difficult for me to take seriously. She’ll choose which kiddy backpack to wear to school but then complain about her philosophical existence or how her mother is “…looking in from a universe of endless darkness.” 
Besides my likes and dislikes, the rest of the show somewhat counterbalances itself. Shizuku and Ryuu from the protection agency were cool, but Hatori’s best friend Ayumu was similarly as annoying as her. The magic from the Dreams of Alice seemed interesting, but the powers present didn’t receive a ton of variety or usage. Sanae was a lot of fun, but she took a heavy backseat within the show beyond the second episode. 
Given that my bigger likes and my big dislike also counterbalance each other, my personal takeaway from this anime is neither super positive nor super negative. Overall, it’s just a whole lot of neutral. 
Alice to Zouroku unfortunately cannot make its dreams a reality. Misplaced focus on a narrative level, early artistic errors, not enough attention spent on particular characters, and annoying details prevent the show’s heartfelt bonds and nice musical repertoire from materializing. A legacy that falls far short of amazing. 
SUMMARY 
Story: Bad, a lack of focus in its structure and purpose, alongside larger grievances, get in the way Sana and Zouroku’s relationship, arguably the most important part of the narrative 
Art & Animation: Fine, while the first episode raises a red flag, the majority of the visuals depict charming designs, nice background art, and okay movement 
Characters: Fine, Sana grows as a kid and as a human through individual experiences and the help of others, especially Zouroku, but he himself does not have much of a presence or an impact 
Music & Sound: Good, a whimsical ED, a melodious OST, and a couple of solid VA performances stand above a passable OP 
Enjoyment: Fine, Sana and her relationship with Zouroku are pluses, Hatori is a big minus, and the rest of the elements counterbalance each other 
Final Score: -/--

Warning, this review contains minor spoilers. No specifics are revealed. 
The Fate series has a lot of hype surrounding it, with Fate Zero regarded by many as one of the greatest anime ever made, and it was my introduction to the series this past summer. After some encouragement from some friends, I decided to watch Fate Zero, and while it’s not as amazing as some would say, I found it to be a great show. So, I was excited to see Ufotable’s adaptation of Fate Stay Night, so much so that I put it on hold so I could marathon it when the season finished, something I blew through in the past two days. So, that leads to the question, was Fate Stay Night able to live up to live up to the hype, or is it just another mediocre show? 
Mindset 
In order to understand my thoughts on this show, you must understand the perspective I’m coming from. As I saw Fate Zero recently, I view FSN as a sequel to Fate Zero. I know that this show is meant to stand on its own, and as such must explain things that I already know. I will attempt not to hold this against the show, but as I know I am at least somewhat biased by this fact, I felt it was best to make this bias clear.  
Also, this is only my review for the first season. I may redo this when the second season comes out, but well, I haven’t so far. So don’t yell at me for failing to take into account some epic scene that occurs there.  
So with that out of the way, let’s move onto the story. 
Story 
I’m pretty sure if you’re reading reviews of the series, you already know the basic premise. Fate tells the story of a Holy Grail War, a death match between - mages for the prize of the wish granting Holy Grail. Each of these - mages is given a servant, a heroic figure from the past to fight alongside. There’s magic and action, and death, and really everything I ask for in a show. 
I will say this much, the story was very gripping. Every time an episode was over, I found myself excited to watch the next one. I did enjoy the mystery of wondering who was who, and what they were all capable of. Another thing that I really like was how they explored what it meant to be a hero of justice. The main character, Shiro is very idealistic, to borrow a term from ThatAnimeSnob’s character video, he’s a Boy Scout character. This really allows him to highlight the themes of the show, contrasting with the death game he’s found himself a part of. 
Unfortunately, that’s about all the good I can say about the story. Now, I really wanted to like Fate, the premise is really interesting, I really liked Fate Zero, but there were so many problems with Fate Stay Night. The first main problem I have with the show is its boring introduction. Much of the first couple episodes are showing the main characters just go through their everyday lives. Yes, I know this was to introduce them, but I found it very dull. The information dumps were really boring as well, though I will admit, part of this is because of what I knew from Fate Zero. 
The second main problem were number things that didn’t make sense. A good example of this is the magic system, which seems to work in whatever ways are convenient to the plot. Such as Shirou randomly having self-healing magic, quite helpful as it seems he seems to be injured about every other episode. He also ends up just happening to use a type of magic he’d never showed any ability with in the show, right as he needed it to save his life.  
There’s also the fact that for a death game, there is surprisingly little death with only one death in the first half of the show. This isn’t for lack of battles either, as it seems like each episode has at least one fight in it. They just normally end with both sides deciding to retreat, wanting to have an honorable fight at a later time or something. If this just happened rarely, then I’d be okay with it, but with it happening all the time, that’s a problem. We have all this build up, but no real payoff. There’s also the fact that in many battles, the fighters are idiots. Typically the mages are weaker than the servants, so it would makes sense to go after them first. So things would go a lot smoother if Archer decided to fire his attacks at Berserker’s master instead of Berserker early on. 
And of course, there is also the inconsistent tone of the show. I enjoy comedy, if I can laugh during a show that normally makes it more enjoyable. Unless the comedy doesn’t fit. Fate Stay Night is a serious story about the death game, so this lighter content really doesn’t fit the mood, and this goes even more so for the romantic subplot with Shirou and Ren. Trying to cram a romance into an action shonen type show does not work, as should be obvious after seeing Sword Art Online 
So in the end, the story really did have potential, but its slew of problems made it fall so short of what it could have been. I did enjoy it, and really want to see more, but I can’t call the story good.  
Characters 
I’ve already talked about Shirou some with the themes the show presented, and that really is the highlight of his character. He is very idealistic, naïve even, but this is why I’m drawn to his character. Many of the others have grown up and seen the dark sides of the world, and know that being a simple hero of justice is impossible. But Shirou contrasts this, not being willing to abandon a few to save many, something that stands in stark contrast to his father. He’s very self-sacrificing, not caring about himself if it means helping another. This is very admirable, and makes me want to see him win, even if it seems like he’s the underdog, and really doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation. 
Shirou’s servant, Saber was one of the main characters in Fate Zero, and one of my favorite characters from that show. Here we see her and her noble characteristics in wanting to be an honorable warrior, and do her job as a knight to protect Shirou, even if Shirou doesn’t really understand the whole stay out of danger thing. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have the same flair, the same convictions as seen before.  I still like her character, but more because of who I knew her as before instead of anything she has done here. So far in FSN, she hasn’t gotten much depth or development, or any awesome moments, though that may change in season -. 
There’s also Rin, another one of the masters and a longtime friend of Shirou. She serves in many ways as Shirou’s guide to the Holy Grail War. At times I really like her, she can be very strong, knows what she wants. She can also be easily flustered, which isn’t a bad thing, however there are times she feels like a standard Tsunade, which really is a shame, as I liked her character at the start. Her feelings and actions toward Shirou seem to be all over the place, from caring about him, to trying to kill him, to possibly being in love with him, to anywhere in the middle, and this inconsistency is her biggest flaw. 
The last of the notable characters is Archer, Rin’s servant. Archer is a very analytical character, which contrasts well with the hot-headedness of Rin, and Shiriou’s idealistic nature. He does what needs to be done to win, and if it requires sacrificing some innocents to do so, then he’s okay with this. His actions at time also seemed to be inconsistent, though I think there may be some reasons behind this which we will see in season -. 
There are a few other side characters, like Shinji who I really want to punch in the face, Caster, who is in many ways the villain of the show, but there isn’t anything that notable about any of them, or the other characters I haven’t mentioned yet. I do hope we get more development for the rest of the cast when season - comes out. One of the things I liked about Fate Zero, is that I could root for most of the teams, to a degree, while here anyone other than Rin and Shirou I don’t care about. 
Shirou really is the only highlight character of the show, and I know that a lot of people don’t like him. I really do wish they’d do more with Saber and Rin, as they have a lot of potential. The other masters and servants are quite disappointing as well, though this could be comparing it to what Fate Zero was able to do. 
Animation/Sound 
The fact that Ufotable is animating Fate Stay Night means that there isn’t much to complain about here. The backgrounds are detailed, using bright lights or the right tone of darkness to highlight the scenes. The actual animation can be lacking at times, especially when it’s just two characters talking, but this is a minor complaint. The battles are done very well from an animation standpoint. Still, there isn’t anything that blew me away animation wise, and while this is a step up from most shows I watch, it isn’t anything amazing. 
The soundtrack is good, accenting the battles with epic music, and who doesn’t like epic music? But still, the music is pretty generic, doing its job, but nothing more. 
The opening did a great job of pulling me in, I think I watched it about -- times in a row when I first saw it. However, as I was watching the show itself, I became less impressed with the opening. Still, it was well animated, had a catchy song, and got me hyped for the show, so I can’t ask for much more than that. 
While I’m normally not one to criticize Japanese dubs, as I have a hard enough time doing that with English, I did have a small complaint that there were times where Shirou’s voice seemed off, which I think might have been that it sounded like another character the voice actor had done, and after doing some research, I found it was Sasuke from Naruto. A pretty small nitpick, but still one I thought mentioning. 
Conclusion 
This show really failed to live up to the hype that I and the rest of the community had. There was so much here that they could have done with the premise, but it just fell flat next to its potential. I wanted to like this, I really did, and there were a number of moments that really made me think this was a great show. Of all the season -’s coming out in ----, this is definitely the one I’m looking forward to the most. But there are too many problems for me to give this much praise beyond anything more than an entertaining watch.

Exciting story 
Interesting themes about being a hero

From the acclaimed director of Shitcom (the only anime I've given a - on MAL as I was actually appalled by it) comes No Littering, a clay-based anime PSA about...not littering. 
Nagao Takena chooses to express this message by having a man and his girlfriend sitting on a park bench. Note that the man never blinks while his girlfriend blinks once. I'd want to believe this was some kind of symbolism/foreshadowing, but Takena isn't that clever. 
Anyways, the man is throwing unidentified cans on the ground (maybe he's getting wasted to deal with the fact he's in a Nagao Takena anime) when Jason comes out of nowhere and stabs him in the eyes. The man's girlfriend runs away in horror, and Jason picks up the cans. The end. 
I gave this a - because, unlike Shitcom, I didn't have any feelings of utter shock/disgust/disappointment in myself for watching it. I actually chuckled at the guy getting stabbed in the eyes since the clay gore was so ridiculous. The animation and music are bad/generic, but this is probably worth a watch once tbh. It's one minute long and possibly Takena's best work.

I started watching this anime after seeing a YouTube video about the top -- romance anime's. So I came in with high expectations because the images and short clips the YouTube video showed interred me and looked cute and something I would enjoy. Off the bat the first few episodes I already liked where it was going. But I have to say personally I hated Shiina and wanted her to die tbh. She was worse than Lightning from Final Fantasy. Or Angel from Angel Beats. She has no character development I don't understand how anyone could find a character like her interesting. She expressed no human emotions or feelings. Right away she seemed liked a spoiled rich girl who needed a nurse to take care of her because all her life she had things handed to her because of her natural talent. I never shipped her with Sorata because she had no emotions or feelings she wasn't Human. I was hoping for an actual romance anime here and I Shipped Aoyama with Sorata but nothing happened there at all I hated it. Sorata only liked Shiina because he's a stupid high school boy thinking with his penis and not with his head.

When you watch a masterpiece such as Deathnote, the review isn't such as a question. How good was it? Should i watch this? No the review is only in question for the morals of its contents, shades and slashes of dark gray and malice rains over this anime. What in gods watchful eyes did i just watch,""Did god blink"" ladiies and gentleman you just watched a evil yes, and sinning yes masterpiece among very few animes.

Unless you like to watch stuff that may or may not make you think of rape and stereotypical weak and pathetic girls, go right on ahead. Click the play button for this anime.  
Because, In my opinion, NOT sugarcoating this, I believe this anime is.. pathetic. 
I watched the WHOLE series waiting for something to actually GOOD happen but seriously.. its just the same thing over and over.  
First of all, the main character, has no say AT ALL. She doesn't even bother trying to fight anyone or anything off. She lets the vampires do anything to her, call her whatever she wants and lets it happen.  
And that brings us to the vampires constantly telling her things that a rapist would most likely say. ""I know you like it,"" etc. Replace the fangs with reproductive system and it will change the WHOLE anime.(Glamorizing rape?)   
To my conclusion.. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone..

A continuation from the old Naruto. While only the first - episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \'same old\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement over the first generation. 
If you haven\'t started watching the new season, don\'t- read the manga instead.

I’m not really into love stories but if you’ll watch few episodes and you’ll understand why it is my favorite anime. 
The beautiful story that keeps developing yet keeps a slice of life vibe, 
The loveble characters that we get to know and watch them grow and bloom to understand themselves better, the sweet love story that isn’t the center of the anime and is realistic, 
Awesome soundtrack, 
Smooth animation, 
Character/background  design at it’s finest. 
It was just a pleasure to watch and I’ll hope you’ll love it as well. 
Not recommended for people that don’t like slice of life.

Darker than Black (the original season) is the best anime I have ever seen. It is very hard for me to choose a favorite, but if forced to pick just one, it would be Darker than Black. Every aspect of it is tightly woven to create this incredible tapestry of imaginative concepts, enjoyable characters, heady philosophies, mystery and suspense, beautiful art, emotional music, and most of all the story has a very deep, important and relevant message to deliver to viewers about society and the consequences of treating minority groups as subhuman and unequal. There is immense social value to the story outside of just entertainment and art. 
Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor takes everything beautifully crafted by the first season and smashes it with a mallet. Unfortunately it does not find its way back together to form a cohesive story. The returning characters from the first series are portrayed in ways completely counter to everything that's been set up for them in the first season and there is no believable reason for it. It actually destroys some of the characters' images so badly they are no longer likable in the full context of the story, despite they were incredibly enjoyable characters in the first series. For example some have gone from caring individuals to abusive degenerates. Not to mention some characters who we were glad to see make it through the first series get expelled quite unceremoniously from the second, which is really disappointing, while some characters whose fates were hinted to be somewhat conclusive in the first series are brought back, making their story arc climaxes in the first season seem meaningless or much less effective. 
For the most part, the abilities of the contractors are far less imaginative in Gemini and border on cliche. As for the story, it is boring, trite and convoluted, with an ending that seems random, makes no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions. There are some very unsettling themes such as child abuse and pedophilia, and when you see such potentially harmful themes in storytelling, it's important for the writer to handle them tactfully and clarify the significance of them in the context of the story. There's really no tact or significance to be seen here. It seems careless and thrown together. 
If you want to know the positive things about this series (there are so few), some of the action scenes and fights are entertaining to watch. Seeing returning characters can be fun for a moment but watching where the writer has the audacity to push their storylines quickly becomes disappointing. My favorite part of most episodes was the ending credits because of the beautiful song ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" by Abingdon Boy's School (who sang the opener ""Howling"" in the first season). It's one of the few things in the series that invokes enjoyable emotions or a sense of beauty, sadly. I had a bad feeling when I saw that Yoko Kanno would not be scoring this series. She only signs on to quality projects, as far as I've seen. I knew that either the budget or time constraints of Gemini of the Meteor had likely prevented it from being able to achieve anything like what the first series did before I even saw it. Shame I was correct. I don't know if Kanno was offered and declined the role as composer, or if she was out of the budget altogether. 
My biggest warning to those who have seen the first season and loved it and are considering seeing the second is this: If you watch this show, a lot of what you will see will go against what you saw in the first show and will warp your perception of events in the first show, potentially harming the experience next time you watch the first season. For many viewers, myself included, it is sort of a slap in the face. I have trouble believing that the same writer wrote both shows because the first is so evocative and intelligent, while the second attempts to convert the series into a magical girl anime and is riddled with controversial fan service that deconstructs the first series in quite unwelcome ways. The first series was a self-contained story that needed no expanding upon, so to even create a sequel risks a lot. It'd be like a sequel to Cowboy Bebop, which if I'm not mistaken, the creator of the series actually said the reason he wasn't interested in a sequel to that show is that it is better to leave people wanting more and quit while you're ahead. 
I watched Gemini of the Meteor before ever hearing any opinions about it from other people or reviews, so I had no idea whether or not it was well-received when I watched it. My opinion emerged independently from that, and while it is disheartening in a way to know so many find it genuinely poor quality, I'm glad in a way that so many others can see how awful this anime really is because it gives me hope that the integrity of quality storytelling like we saw in the first series is valued and defensible among the anime community. Sadly, Gemini of the Meteor really manages to take the humanity out of Darker than Black, and if you ask me the humanity of the first season's story is the most important thematic element that gave the series it's freshness and substance.

So, an romance/comedy/SoL Anime. Frim time to time i watch them just for the fun of it. Reading most of the reviews it didn't sound bad, but for me it was. 
Biggest problem for me is that it had fit into ~-- episodes, but not --. Too long did it look like the producers streched it. 
Starting with the chars, beside the two MC's no other char got a development at all. After the two first episodes they are all still standing the same way. Some got dumped, some showed up later but it doesn't gave something for the story whatsoever. 
Talk about chars, let's get the male one first: Not only dense, a total assburger. Shoving the girl away ~- times and still don't break up with her, what a mess. He just pissed me off so much, i needed to FF sometimes. 
Now the female char: Running for a guy at ~- jeahrs, gets dumped repeatly and still goes for him? I know it is not RL, but still, this is an alternate universe. 
So overall, sometimes i like that kinda shows, but this just dissapointed me.

When it comes to Japan's obsession with trying to make things 'cute', nothing is out of bounds in the realm of possibility.  In an effort to make even the simple story of an idealized high school romance quirky and comedic, I think it's clear that sometimes things get taken too far even if it's for laughs. 
Akkun to Kanojo or 'Akkun and his girlfriend' grants us a - cours of - minute episodes, each episode functioning like a --koma series where we're treated to Atsuhiro, or Akkun, playing a male tsundere to his girlfriend whenever she comes to spend time together or suggest something for them to do. 
The main draw of this series comes primarily from his reactions where he shoots down his girlfriend Non's suggestions a la verbal abuse (literally calling her trash, ugly, what have you), before going to the other room and acting all deredere and obsessive in secret because in reality, he sees her as an angel that's graced this plagued earth and should be protected at all costs.  He just can't physically show any affection towards her while she's around because...reasons.  This persists throughout the entire runtime, and thank god it's only - minutes per episode because being subjected to this schtick for longer would be slogging the experience. 
In fact, I feel like any of the other 'couples' featured in the show: Atsuhiro's sister x his arguably creepy best friend, and the teacher with X face snake girl would be an even better story to tell because even though they stick to the status quo just like any other --koma, they actually seem like they could get somewhere, and they do actually make inches of progress.  Whereas on the other hand, our main couple doesn't do jack and it's actually more unsettling to watch especially considering our main protagonist records the voice and has an entire room filled with pictures of his girlfriend on the walls and ceiling.  Which is NOT cute in the slightest. 
Personally I don't think even by anime short standards that this is anything worth watching.  It feels like Japan is just trying to make whatever kind of quirky relationship they can cute, when it's visually a very unhealthy and somewhat abusive relationship intended to be played for laughs.  Definitely not an hour and a half well spent.

This thing which many of you call anime used to be cool at some point until the producers decided to just destroy with loads of fillers. Of course, it was never a top anime. The twists and the storytelling is fine but I don't understand why is everything so Cliche in it. I mean, one character dies on the battlefield and everyone just stand still and stop fighting and look at that dying character. Also the dialogues appear to be the work of - year old writers. The art is fine but it got very bad in some critical points like the Pain arc. (I'm pretty sure everyone remembers the crappy animation and style during Naruto's fight with pain) 
The character development is fine also but they ruin it by giving them too many crappy dialogues. 
Overall it is good at some certain points but the story started to get worse and worse with time until recently when the story was just totally destroyed.

This is... an oddity. 
Technicalily it is supposed to be a serious anime about weapon dealers, war, and so on, but for some strange reason most of the time it resmebles a fairly average school trip slice of life comedy. That coudl also be the reason why at one point I dropped it almost for - months and only after that manageed to finish it. 
Story -/--: 
It is supposed to be serious and it does touch serious subjects and there are people dying, but.... either due to directing or becuase of some reason, it looks like bunch of mercenaris fooling aroudn and having a good time, cracking jokes and so on. Even in serious segments it doesn't feel like there's any danger and so on. 
Noir, which I watchedm any years ago, was much better of handlign stuff like this. 
Art: -/--: 
Well, characters have surprisingly low amount of details on their faces, and main female lead has a triangular face type with low amount of detail. However, rather than being a cookie-cutter style that is frequently used in some school-related comedies (where you can confuse males from different series, where everybody is proportioned as a teen and so on), this time aroudn this seems to be an artistic choice, albeit an unusual one. It is neither realism, nor comical ""chibi-fication"". Backgrounds are fairly good, and a lot of effort was put into portraying various military tech. 
There's some CG and at moments it is noticeable. 
Sound: -/-- 
One of the least impressive intro/outro themes I heard (""Her name is Koko, she is loco, hey yeah!""), and it doesn't set the right tone for what looks like it was supposed to be a serious anime. Female lead often soudns like she doesn't take herself too seriously, and it is unclear whether this is intentional or not. 
Character: -/--: 
Characters fail to portray themselves as believable people, and their interactiosn and relationships look aritificail. Well, at least female lead is slightly amusing while prancing around and making faces. 
Enjoyment: -/--: 
It is a meh. At one point I got bored with it and dropped it for a very long time. 
Overall: -/--: 
If you have a lot of time on your hands, you could check it out, but this anime is an odd one. Not a masterpiece, probably fails to present difficult subjects properly. But there's something unusual about it, so perhaps in the end it is worth watchign.

Let me start off by saying that this is my first review so go easy o.O 
I saw the first FullMetall Alchemist series and loved it. I was hooked from episode one when they aired it on Cartoon Network. Being the somewhat impatient person I am, I went online searching for the next episode one night after the tenth or eleventh episode had finished. I found what I was looking for and found that there were -- episodes waiting to be downloaded! Yes, you can assume this anime is what made me discover fan subbing -_^. Anyway, the anime was great, I couldn't get enough when the series ended on that metal fist grabbing at the sun. Not too much later I discovered that a movie was coming out and it was the completion of the anime series that had finished. Needless to say, I was excited, I enjoyed the FINAL conclusion of the story. Now that I've said all this, I wanted to say that I always felt like there were ""holes"" in the story. Like, information that was there but not being told. Well... 
Not too long ago, I got bored one day, so I looked for some manga to read (FYI Manga/Anime isn't a huge hobby just a coincidence =P) and found the FMA manga. I decided to read it, to see if there was a huge difference between the manga and the anime. I cheated a little bit and started off a bit into the story and discovered that lots of stuff was there that was not in the anime. So, I had to treck back to a point where this information started. I finished the manga in a couple days and WOOOW. Not only was I correct about there being some information missing in the anime, but there was so so so so so much more that was supposed to happen. 
So, it's my assumption that this new series is going to follow in the true story of the FMA and the two brother's journey in their alchemy filled fantasy world. So far the story that is being told in the ""Brotherhood"" series is sticking pretty true to the manga. If this is true, please, take my advice, stay tuned. Especially if you were a good fan of the first series or just love a good anime with great plot twists and a great story line. whatever your interest, if my assumption is correct, which I'm --.-% sure it is, you're all in for a real treat! =)

At first look, Seirei no Morbito may seem like a repeat of a story that has been told over and over and over...but it is not. Yes, there a million + one stories out there where the lead protagonist is rescuing and saving the life of others, and half of such characters may end up being women, so in this respect the series is not very unique. It's the overall story, terrific animation, and strong character designs, that make Seirei an interesting anime. 
With a fictional, historical setting, the story takes place in a time when Emperors rule the people, and mythical beings rule the lands. Through a twist of faith, Balsa -the protagonist - is approached to protect the life of a young prince whose life is in danger. Nothing new right? That's true. However, the reason for the young prince's fate is not because of a struggle for the throne as we see quite often, and it is not because he is hated...it is actually quite the opposite. And at first, the job, though one with many obstacles in sight, seems fairly simple enough...but it later becomes quite complex as Balsa and her crew learn that the Emperor is not the only one after the boy's life. I won't go into any more details and ruin it, but will say that storyline is fascinating. 
The Art is Outstanding. It is sharp, colorful, detailed where it needs to be, and a pleasure to watch. There is always better out there, but for this series I truly believe it was more than sufficient. I especially liked the creator's different sketches of Balsa that is shown at the start of each episode, as it gives a glimpse of  his work &quot;in progress&quot;. 
My absolute FAVORITE thing, is the way the fights are drawn and animated. It's nothing short of awesome. The combat moves, spear and sword manipulations, and other maneuvers, are VERY FAST, but...you can see every single movement. Every single one. There is no blur, and no &quot;what the hell just happened&quot; moments that usually spring up when you can't visually follow along, Everything is seen in detail, as fast as it does go by, and it really pulled me in. There are so many shows out there, that should take a page from this. 
Loved it!!! 
The music is  good. I am not particularly fond of the opening song as it just sounds like --.-% screaming. There are not that many varying scores within, and you probably won't walk away humming anything, but those heard are very fitting and suitable. 
The Character design and development is Great. 
Balsa is not your typical beautiful heroine who just happens to be talented with a spear. She's strong, and she looks it. In all honesty, there is nothing very special about her personality or attitude, but she still carries the story well. 
My interest lies in the other supporting actors, such as Shuga - the young star diviner who owns a look that is not typical for white haired anime guys. He is an intriguing character to watch out for as a guy who pushes himself to do his best, despite his position. 
Then there are the emperors assassins who surprised me with their unique talents and characteristics. It's not often that these type of characters are usually shown to be more than &quot;muscle&quot;. It was good to see how unique they each were, despite not being main characters. 
Then there is Touya with his bucked teeth, the Shaman who is a bottle of sake away from being a true alcoholic, Sagum the older prince who you WILL NOT be able to dislike, and many more. 
Their designs are all nicely created, and together they &quot;do good&quot; 
I enjoyed this series immensely. Don't pick it up if you're only hungry for fighting scenes, nor expect it to be very deep with twists at ever turn...because it's not like that. It's just a nice series to kick back and relax to, where the few fights are pretty intense, and there is a great deal of emphasis on how characters interact and associate with each other.

I feel the need to write this review because I feel cheated. 
Honestly, I really wanted to like this anime, but either the entire point of this anime flew over my head, or people think this anime is good because, well, it pretends to be good. It's so SO edgy and it just comes off as trying too hard. The art is unique, which I would appreciate - if it wasn't so lazy. The anime is full of interesting visuals, but the art style ruins it. For an anime that has so much gore and violence, I'd expect this to at least look good, but the blood looks like -D puke that someone drew in MS paint. The characters are flat just like the art :) and the plot is aaalll over the place. 
Honestly I'm ashamed I expected more from Netflix. Don't watch this anime. Watch Pingu in the City instead.

Well not long ago started watching this series and now have ""watched"" quite lot. And I don't get it how people have so high opinion of this series. 
Story:  
Is quite boring honestly, if you like watch same joke -- * in episode for ---+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until Summit War arc. In that arc there was interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he peaces and didn't give a damn what other we're thinking. That is only reason I gave this series even -, would have been - or even - without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went to back to boring as there doesn't seem to be any reason for any fighting again. 
Art: 
Well quality in art is like a roller coaster in this this series, some scenes it is good and some bad. But I like old feeling what art style gives and that's why I rated it to -. Could have been much higher if quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seems to be they're not scared to use colors what I'm happy about. 
Sound: 
To be honest, nothing too fancy but quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall. 
Character(s): 
Well characters in this series are --% of boring or fanservice. There is literally none character development in this series so I don't get it how this series are even going on anymore. 
Luffy: 
Pretty good character but I have watched over --- episodes and still personality exactly same as beginning of first episode of whole series. As a fighter he is getting stronger but it don't feel like it at all because still sidekicks gives him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly. 
Usopp: 
--% of boredom. He don't have growth at all in whole series as person. As a fighter he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That's everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don't even get a reason of this character because of... 
Tony Tony Chopper: 
Chopper are pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if situation requires it. Chopper is as character is direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also Luffy to stop and cries help but if situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp don't. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series. 
Nami: 
This character is ---% of fanservice and nothing else. She don't have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just side character who drops after she's arc end but no. 
Zoro: 
This is most interesting character in whole series, he is actually only one who has grown as person in whole crew, and that's pretty sad considered how long this series has already run.  
Sanji: 
After Usopp this is second most boring character in whole series. He has not developed as person nor as fighter at all. And his obsession to women joke is gone too long and got boring already. I actually hope he dies on nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all. 
Brook: 
Can be quite interesting character but feels like he's going to be in same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy's boat he went to bottom, he honestly don't give anything new to series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper jokes so they don't repeat same joke - jokes whole episode but -. 
Nico Robin: 
Sometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive story forward. 
Franky: 
Last but not least, this character actually got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite lot. I hope they don't ruin this because Franky got a lot potential as MC. 
Enjoyment: 
Well as I said in story, this series is quite boring and I have been ""watching"" this. Only ""watching"" not watching cause it's hard to enjoy same jokes over --- episodes. And usually I keep this rolling for background sound so when I'm doing other things. I actually had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations was crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment. 
Overall: 
Well this section is more like TL;DR for me 
- Do you like watch same joke in every episode till you die? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like series what are --% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- Do you like characters don't grow at all (even after --- episodes)? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it. 
- If you want to watch this you can skip straight to Summit War arc cause there really isn't any development in this series so you won't miss anything.

Preamble: english language is not my native, sorry for possible mistakes. Review can include minor spoilers. 
So, after I watched this film, has wrote my thoughts, I decided to check out different reviews of other people on this film. As I expected they all are quite positive, and I think I just need to write my own, because the main thing of reviews is constructive criticism, not babbling about how it's ""wonderful and nice"". And this film can easily be critisized. It has a lot of flaws and weak points. 
As Isao Takahata is one of my favourite anime directors and I value him even more than Miyazaki, I must say this is one of his weakest works. Isao Takahata, Studio Ghibli, Joe Hisaishi... An adaptation of the Japanese folk tale ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" (--th-century Japanese folktale). What to say, I had huge expectations on this film. My all time favourite creators made film on one of favourite japanese tales. Maybe that's a problem of too big expectation? No, it's not. Realization was really quite bad. 
Again, the film is based on the Japanese folk tale - ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"". So this is nothing more than an adaptation of the eponymous fairy tale recorded in the X century and is considered one of the oldest of the surviving Japanese stories, and even one of the earliest precursors of science fiction overall. 
This time it wasn't great direction, smart work and production. However it is interesting, dramatic, even melodramatic film, which squeezes tears from you. Or at least tries to. Atypical panache and animation, something reminding me of some Soviet old animation and multiplication of --s and --s. 
Taketori, old man, collector of bamboo and craftsman, finds a little girl in bamboo shoots. And, considering it as a message from heaven, he brings up the girl with his wife as his own. Considering her a princess, he wanted to give her a life of luxury. Little later Taketori finds gold and expensive beautiful things and clothes in the bamboo for the 'Babmoo girl', as the village boys christen her. She will be given Kaguya name much later. But let's call her Kaguya from here. So, Kaguya is very playful girl and she is growing extremely fast. She has outstanding beauty as well. 
Girl loves nature and her friends from village, she is doing good, walks and rejoices. Especially she made friends with one guy... But finally the parents arrange and carry her into the city, to the castle. Now she is a princess, the highness. Princess Kaguya. But she was not happy in the castle. Even aristocracy wanted to marry her, but she doesn't want it, she wants to be with that village boy. Briefly it's like that. Sad, but true. Nothing can replace that true nature for her, the freedom and bustle on the nature with friends. Nevertheless, she wants her parents and Taketori to be happy. So she acts as noble princess. Again, many notable people sought her hand, even king himself. Kings forced a connection with her, and something mystical happens again. Now we know that she is from the Moon. Well, well, well... So, in fact, the work is full of theatricality. And of course I don't like that. Also there are many absurd and moments of frustration that appears, there were a lot of silly moments and scenes. On the other hand, it is the vital thing, the problem of fathers and children, just built in the absolute. Good intentions leads to poor circumstances. In the end, it turns out, as always. Eh... Pretty mediocre film, to say frankly. Very uneven film, I can say even rough. I've read the story itself, of course the problem in it itself, however overall production wasn't that great, again. Pretty weak. Don't get me wrong, it still was nice experience, however much more in disappointment way. Eternal road. And even memory of this film will fade, while I have quite phenomenon memory, because it's not that brilliant. Sorry for not indexing quite clear arguments this time, it's just hard to do in this film. It's not logical problems, it's more like exaggeration and overstatement of human feelings. Those love stories are full of bullshit, we have seen tons of them. Many people living unhappy lives with unloved works and even companions. And they don't put it as huge tragedy. The film is doing just it - like it's a huge tragedy. While the truth is there are far more tragic things in life. 
Music of Joe Hisaishi is good as usual, but this time not something outstanding as well. 
This kinda reminded me of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Interesting, what people would say, if it was not Ghibli movie and not Takahata's work. Probably, not as they say in their reviews. Most of them. I guess so. Majority just get accustomed to high level of Ghibli and don't want to admit that they have no critical thinking or bad taste. Illusions are far sweeter. 
It's a pity for me, because Isao Takahata is really one of my favourites. However it's ok, you can't do only Masterpieces. But I want to think maybe I was expected too much from this film, however I'm just maximum 'subjective objective' as I can, being logical and rational. It's really not that great film in comparing even to other Ghibli works. One of their worst films so far, unfortunately. One of the rare cases when I can say about Ghibli movie - pretty mediocre. -/--.

K-On!!, or as I like to call this season, K-No more please. 
I won't be touching the whole series but just this season only in this review, I will leave the first season untouched after watching this as the first season was good enough to be left alone. For this review I won't dwell as much as I have covered much in the first review, I will just point out the flaws and problems I had with this. To start, this season is a good example of quantity over quality. Definitely there is a issue with the pacing parts here and there, I must say at times, I just felt bored and uninteresting in what the show had to offer. I'm calling out and using episode - and - as an example of the studio running out of idea to offer. In these two episodes I was severely disappointed at what was offered, I had lost interest multiple times while watching these two especially. Thankfully it got better with upcoming episodes but still is no where close that of the first season. Another issue I had was the show inconsistency of balancing out the comedy, music and slice of life. For this season I had like, --% music, --% comedy and --% slice of life. The slice of life factor was a huge part in this season and that was a disappointment I had, I was actually expecting the same balance layout it had in the first season. Honestly, I the real reasons this ain't as good as the first season is simple. It's too long, not a lot of creative or interesting ideas to fit it's long run time and lastly, the pacing. 
-SCORES- 
Character- -/--: Roughly the same characters as the last season, just wished there was something more to be offered especially after such a long series. 
Art- -/--: Same same, but different, but still same. 
Writing- -/--: Oooowee did they not impress me at all in this season 
Sound- -/--: Got some nice songs, like the farewell one at the last part, however the intros can't surpass the first one. 
Overall, Kinda let down but I guess it wasn't super bad. I can't see why people would rate this more over the first, definitely the first season was better. Plus what is with the ending for this season, I expected a good closer for them to go off to college at episode --, instead we get - somewhat head-scratchers to end the series in such a bad manner. To be accurate there is still the movie but I'm just judging this series alone.

OK, fellow lion tamers. Here we go, with my first review. 
Unfortunately, I have to say, Nuki Doki! Tenshi to Akuma no Sakusei Battle; leaves a lot of stuff out of the mix. Those of you have seen part (or all) of this anime, know enough about this that I should not have to itemize by scores, where I am on this anime. 
PoRO needs to be horsewhipped. They've done worse work, and they've done better work. Nuki Doki is simply not worth anybody's time. Don't know why I bothered. I ran into episode -, some time ago, and was mildly intrigued. I waited, then I waited some more. Finally episode - arrived (on several sites). I was shocked to find that there was no story continuation, no meaningful expansion of plot lines, no reasonable expansion of the characters. 
In fact, things tended to get worse. 
The male protagonist, Mr. Yamato is utterly interchangeable. He also does absolutely nothing except acquiesce to every sexual approach attempted by Sera and Filika. OK, that might seem good, for some; but when he turns down Filikas' contract (purported to be for purposes unknown, never really explained) I said to myself ""... OK, maybe this guy has some brains ..."". But no. He becomes a golem, with no attitudes at all, no commentary of his own, no real astonishment that Filika keeps dismembering him, as if that will help her scores (pun intended); no commentary about maybe he is sick and tired of being stolen out from under Sera (even though the plot, the stuff they give us, plainly points out the Filika and Sera may not interfere in any way with the other persons' sexual activities). 
Filika is the first character we are introduced to. She plays a demon from the fires of Hell (you get to pick the one you like. After all the Chinese have over a thousand of them). She complains about having to appear to her target male, via a toilet; even though virtually anyone from Hell would be pleased to be handed ice water. The toilet and sewer pipe are drawn clean, and she stays dry. She complains. She is arrogant, petulant, and stupid. She has carried out the wishes of her superiors, without regard to ground rules which might be used to determine the winner of the internal struggle. And she never even asks. 
Sera is the other combatant, in this supernatural struggle. She is proported to be an Angel, we don't know from where, and the story doesn't say. We are forced to make ludicrous assumptions. She is exactly the opposite of Filika, in most ways. She is polite, commiserative, kind, helpful, and generous in all ways. The only similarity between the two girls is that she is more incompetent than Filika. She performs a task, which saves the life of Yamato (something so unique that Filika can only stand and watch in amazement); only to let this pass. Anyone else would have demanded this action be scored, and be delivered the victory. This story should have been immediately over. There is no possible response to balance this action, from Filika. Even Filika's bosses would not want the target male to be killed before the end of the contest. Afterward, who cares. 
OK, general commentary. Both girls in the contest are stupid and vapid. In every single case, there is significantly more going on inside their sex organs, than there is between their ears. In short, they are blow-up dolls, having no capacity whatever to give pleasurable feedback to a male partner. The artwork is up to PoRO's high standards (and the women in the show are drawn beautifully), and so is the sound and the dialog actors performances (although, just between you and I; I have no idea why they bothered to perform so well). The basic story is initially intriguing, but then falls completely flat leaving nowhere for this story to go. We can see the problem, more clearly, if we ask some questions: 
Do I care if either girl wins? No. 
Do I care what happens, after the show finally meanders its way to an ending, to Mr. Yamato? No. 
Do I care about the conversations between our two lovely judges? No. 
DO I have any sexual fantasies about having sex with either blow-up doll? No. 
Is the proper ending, the splitting of Mr. Yamato in half and placing each half on the wall of each relevant judge as a trophy? Yes, yes yes! 
Should each contestant female be made to pump water for the house plumbing, in which they have been living (for weeks), forever? Yes, yes, yes! 
Should the judges, as pretty as they are, be fed to the creatures of the -- realms? Yes, yes, yes! 
And there you have it. My first review on this blog. I give it an overall -, and only because the artwork and voice acting is above par; the rest is unredeemably bad!

Toradora is not just a romantic comedy or a comedic romance; it is both a comedy and a romance. If Toradora was simply either a romance or a comedy, I reckon it would still be pretty darn good. And that is how good i find Toradora to be. 
P.S- sorry but this review is kinda long so... 
Story: --/-- 
The story revolves primarioy around Taiga and Ryuji. Ryuji loves Taiga's best friend and Taiga love Ryuji's best friend. And so they decide to help each other in their quest to attain the love of those who they each love. Simple right? Nope. Taiga can be described using most, if not all of the following words; psychotic, dangerous, insane, selfish, demanding, and brutal, despite her extremely small stature (she's only - foot - inches tall!!). On the other hand Ryuji is a kind, gentle, and caring boy whose eyes resemble those of someone who wants to hurt you and who has  a compulsive desire for everything to be orderly and hygienic. If the joining of two such personalities in the same quest of love isn't enough for you to be interested, then keep reading. Otherwise, go watch the first episode and I swear you will not be disappointed. 
The first episode of Toradora is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, first episodes of any anime I've watched. It does an extremely good job of introducing your two main characters and it does so in a pretty hilarious fashion. But what I like most about this anime is that the quality of episode never really declines at all after the first one. The quality stays at a consistently high level throughout the entire anime. Eventually you meet all the other characters such as Taiga's love Yuusaku, Ryuji's love Minori, the fake face bitch Ami, and the assortment of other interesting and funny supporting characters. 
What I love so much about this story is that nothing exciting really ever happens in the lives of these students compared to other anime I have watched. Toradora uses seemingly simple everyday tasks and happenings to develop each character and their respective relationships with the other characters extremely well. However, having said that, each of the main characters aside from Ryuji have their own mini story arcs, whereby each character gets a little bit more screen time than they usually do. Unlike other anime I have seen like Kanon or Clannad, each arc doesn't place a complete focus on a single character but instead includes all the other characters. On top of that each arc contributes heavily to the overall story and it makes for a much more memorable watching experience. 
Now there are only two real small problems that I have with this anime and honestly, they are are really small problems so they night not affect your watching experience. 
First of all, I may just sound like I'm cocky but after I had finished the first episode, I knew what the outcome of the anime would be. However having said that, I would like to quote one of the Earth Kingdom nomad performers from Avatar: The Last Airbender; ""going to a destination is not about the destination but rather about the going"". I've been waiting to apply this quote to an anime for a long time and I finally got my chance. I knew what the outcome was going to be but it in no way lowered the quality of my watching expereince. Despite knowing what was going to happen, I still loved every moment and every scene this anime had to offer me. And even when the anime had reached its brilliant conclusion, one of which I had already known, I could not prepare myself for the emotions I felt in the final episode. However, having said that, I have to say that the anime did an earn extremely good job of convincing me that the outcome I had predicted was not going to be the case and at times during the anime, my confidence in the outcome I had predicted waned quite a bit, almost to the point where I completely scrapped my idea of what was going to happen. 
Secondly, *this is about the ending and despite the fact there are no spoilers I understand some people may not want to know anything about the ending so please skip this paragraph if you are on of these people* the final five or so minutes of the anime completely ripped my heart out and went on to mend it extremely quickly. After finishing Toradora, I just felt like too much was packed into the final few minutes. Despite, brilliant and emotion-evoking dialogue, I feel as though the final five minutes would've been better should there have been extra episode. Five minutes to rip out my heart and mend it just didn't seem like enough to satisfy me. 
Characters - -/-- 
I've already touched on the characters in the story category so I will be a bit more brief here. Every single character in this anime was unique and likeable, at least in my opinion. I've already described Taiga to you and honestly, she is the selling point for the show in the first few episodes. If you don't like girls with personalities like Taiga's, then you may not like this anime or the first few episodes may be a bit rough for you. However, as previously mentioned, I said that the character development and the development of their relationships is done extremely well in Toradora. This is particularly evident with Taiga. As the story begins to uncover the softer side of her personality and reveal more about her past, you start to see a Taiga that you may be more accustomed to. 
My single flaw with the characters in this anime is Ami. I may have previously said that each character is developed extremely well and Ami is no exception. However, her screen time decreases quite a bit as the anime progresses and this disappoints me quite a bit. As a result her character development becomes stunted and she is reduced to the role of ""observer"" and occasionally she gets a few lines here and there; however many of these lines often go unheard by other characters and the final scene in which she says anything meaningful and worth contributing to the story is cut short and ultimately had no impact on me. 
Art: --/-- 
The art in Toradora is nothing too special... when it doesn't want to be. However, when the anime wants to display a beautiful sunset, a wintry night, or a Christmas tree that is the life of the party, this anime can be extremely beautiful. 
Sound: --/-- 
Don't even get started on the OSTs in Toradora. They are brilliant. The openings and closings are catchy and I honestly really like them. Toradora'so closings are some of the few closing that I ever bothered to watch more than once because I just really liked them. There is also the Christmas song performed by Taiga and Ami which I loved despite only having listened to it once. 
As for background music, it does an absolutely splendid job of amplifying the moods and emotions associated with their respective scenes. I have to give special mention to the OST or OSTs which started before a comedic moment. As soon as they we started I would always have a big grin on my face, ready to start laughing when the moment came and I feel as though this had a huge impact on the fact that I actually found Toradora absolutely hilarious. Similarly, the OSTs during sad moments also amplified the feels that I felt, particularly one which I cannot really pinpoint, otherwise I would need to spoil one of the anime's greater moments. It nearly made me cry listening to it outside of the anime. 
The voice acting in the dub version (which is what I watch so deal with it) was brilliant. Taiga was nailed perfectly in my opinion, especially given the fact that her character must be an absolute handful to voice act. I also want to mention Ami's voice actor who was able to switch between bitch Ami and nice Ami extremely smoothly, and Minori's voice actor who gave so much life to a character who's ideals and beliefs are bigger than life itself. There isn't much I can really say about the other voice actors. They did fine jobs in their respective roles and none of the characters ever felt bland or out of place due to their voice acting. 
Enjoyment: --/-- (rounded down to --/--) 
I've never been much of a romance or comedy type of guy, opting instead for action and adventure. But Toradora captured my imagination and my heart only a few episodes into the series, landing it a place on my top - favourite anime of all time, possibly even my favourite. It was a viewing experience of the highest quality and I storngly, strongly, strongly recommend this anime to just about anyone, whether they are a fan of romance and comedy or not. 
I hope I helped you make a decision in whether you want to watch Toradora or not. Feedback is much appreciated! 
Edits: The name of the Christmas song is Holy Night and the sad song is Lost My Pieces should you want to check them out before starting the anime.

Story (--/--): One might think that a -- minute short could not possibly have enough time to develop a heartwarming story and make its viewers truly feel the emotions intended by the producers. There is not a single word spoken in this entire short, yet it tells a story greater than any words in the world could do justice. Tsumiki no Ie is the epitome of ""A picture tells a thousand words."" The story itself is about a man in a world where the sea level constantly rises, and when he accidentally drops his favorite pipe in the water, he dives down into the ocean. He dived for the pipe and found something greater than that.  
Art (--/--): The art style in Tsumiki no Ie can only be described as having a comforting, homey feel. The choice of art style fits Tsumiki no Ie's story and message to a T. The art is a breath of fresh air I did not know I needed. 
Sound (--/--): Despite not having a single word in the entire short, in dialogue or the music, the soundtrack adds a unique aspect to an already beautiful short. The soundtrack, lack of dialogue, and the art style work together like a symphony to provide the perfect atmosphere to present Tsumiki no Ie's message. 
Character (--/--): The characters' emotions are quite real. When they were sad, I was sad, when they were happy, I was happy. Their motives, their memories, their way of life was realistic to the extreme. I could relate to each and character, despite only seeing them for -- minutes.  
Enjoyment (--/--): I am beyond impressed by Tsumiki no Ie's use of storytelling techniques, art, sound, and characters. As MALGraph's Short Movie Achievement says ""Good things come in small packages."" I did not believe that statement before but now, after watching Tsumiki no Ie, I completely understand.  
Overall (--/--): I think that what most shows try to do in -- episodes or more, Tsumiki no Ie did in -- minutes, and not only that but achieved it in a way that a -- episode show could not. Tsumiki no Ie has opened my eyes to the world of shorts and has changed my perspective on both the shorts genre as a whole, but also the concept of a wordless anime.

I have to say, I did not expect this anime to be so fantastic.  It's one of those that just pulls you in.  It's an anime where you fall in love with the characters, find yourself screaming at the screening, ""D'aww""-ing at some points, and outright relieved at others.  This was my favorite anime of the summer, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  The fact that it had to end felt bittersweet.  You're happy it's over, because all good things have to end, but you're sad because you know that the feelings you had towards the characters and the show will never be replicated. 
I would recommend that, if you read any of these reviews, you give the show a chance.  You won't be disappointed at all.

This is my first review... so... why don't start with writing about a anime I recentely end watching? 
~My English is bad and i'm sorry for that~ 
♜Story♜ 
No Game No Life's story follows Sora and Shiro, two shut-in gamers who thinks the real world is a bad game. They recieve a message from a stranger, asking what they think about they world and what would they do if they were in another world. After a chess game, they go to an fantasy world, where wars and fights doesn't exists, instead, they have games. 
The story is not bad, I like the idea of having games instead of wars. I never got bored or anything... BUT.... the story progresses very slowly.... 
♜Art♜ 
I LOVED the art. The background is very detailed... and... the neon colors... I loved them. 
Madhouse, you did a really good job. 
♜Sound♜ 
The Opening and Ending were perfect, I loved them, especially the ending. 
The background music was awesome. Especially the music that played when they played games. Just perfect. 
In voice acting... I LOVED Steph's and Shiro's voice. Sora's voice is perfect too. 
I LOVE YOU KAYANO AI. I love your Shiro's expresionless voice. ;w; 
They really put effort and love in their characters... and talking about characters... 
♜Characters♜ 
I'm going to cover - characters only. :P 
Sora is a virgin -- years old boy. He's charismatic and a perv. He knows how to use tactics and strategies to win, and he does it very well. He always will say he will win even if the game hasn't started. 
To be honest, I think I fell in love with him... yep... you can call me a weeaboo if you want, for me is a honor to be one. 
Shiro is a -- years old girl... wait... you may be saying ''but she's the typical moe fanservice loli!''... that's what I thought too...but remember this is a ecchi anime,  anyway.. but Shiro is a GENIUS! For having -- years, she knows alot more about games than his brother Sora. She sometimes has her boob grabing and moe time. 
Sora & Shiro are always together they are the 『  』(blank) team , if you put them in different rooms they will start to miss eachother and having panic attacks... 
Steph, or Stephanie Dola.... hmmm... I just have to say this: she ONLY exists to make jokes about her. Accept it. She only was helpful one time, after that time, she was still the ''clown'' of the show. 
She's only there so eveyone can make jokes about her... poor Steph... I still love her voice tho. 
♜Enjoyment♜ 
I really enjoyed this anime, the -- minutes where too short for me. 
The refferences to other animes where funny, the comedy with ecchi mix was funny. 
The episode - & - made me cry.... want to know why? Not going to tell you! Watch the anime and discover it by yourself! :D 
♜Overall♜ 
--/--, would watch again but I have other animes to watch. 
If you search something game releated that isn't SAO, this anime is perfect for you. 
~This was my first review, sorry if it's too short. I don't have experience writing reviews, but I wanted to try.~

History: 
By far the most perceptible thing was the fact that there are various kingdoms that just living to fight each other, and the characters who lead these groups, with the exception of Shingen Takeda, do not show any moral framework and sense of leadership or visible level of wisdom to make someone believe they commanded people. 
Art / Animation; 
Common, except for the action scenes where the characters show decline with colorful lights emanating from their body, which, taking into account the anime plot, sounded irregular. 
Sound / Voices: 
Common. Curiously the  opening  is sung by the band Abingdon Boys School who has played Innocent Sorrow  in D.gray-man anime. 
Characters: 
One aspect is that leave no doubt about what your target audience, but most often they are not credible. There are too many fan-service, both in the ecchi, as important parts as in start of a war in which the characters stop to talk ""legally fucking things"" in the vision of the creators. 
Enjoyment / Innovation: 
Sengoku Basara is an anime theoretically past in ancient Japan, where the characters have no depth, no consistent dialogue nor search credible and reliable objectives, the anime has a disorder about which hero should follow as well not seem to know where he wants to go and ends the mess using a lot of repeated formulas in various animes.

I really like a good Yaoi and lemon, but this is the worst I've ever seen! 
Literally, the animation is gross, the story is gross, there is no justification to say that there is real love or even consent in this. 
What scared me the most is how horrible the animation and the main character are. 
There is a ""seme"" (if I can call this asshole a seme) sociopath that just buyed the poor guy and think that loves him. 
There is a -- year old typical uke that looks like a child, is a slave and just don't have any personality except for fear and ""being an object"". Seryously ,don't watch this abomination. It's just worse than Boku no Pico. 
No, just NO.

Well, to start this off, I'm not really a yaoi fan, so if you're like me and not into yaoi, you might want to check out my review, or if you want an honest opinion from someone who doesn't usually dabble in this genre. 
To say the least, I have shipped my fair share of lesbian or gay couples and I have a massive list of ships, many of which are gay. I've never directly dabbled in yaoi because a.) it's hard to come across in mainstream shonen circles, which is where I spend a lot of my time, b.) because it's a little unrealistic and too filled with sex for my tastes and c.) because I don't really like the way they portray roles of a 'feminine' and 'masculine' person in the relationship. However, I was watching citrus (again, I just wanted to try out the genre... can't say I've been liking that either) when Koisuru Boukun showed up in my recommendations.  
Unfortunately, I wasn't told there was sex in it. I assumed it was implied. I've read my fair share of Hapi Mari?! and watched shows like Mitsu x Mitsu Drops, but this is more *ahem* /detailed/ than I'm used to. I wasn't very into this for many reasons.  
First of all, the story had a lot of potential. I'm not the biggest fan of long, unnecessary sex scenes in my anime, but since it needed to be there, I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't so... unsettling. It was a little graphic, yes (I should've checked the rating: the was a fault on my part) but I was mostly unsettled because of the dubious (or nonexistent) consent going on. It was more of a rape situation. That really hampered my enjoyment of this OVA.  
The art was pretty and the sound was good enough (there were some squelching noises I could definitely do without). 
The characters left more to be desired. It was all focused on them, yet they made little sense and their motivations seemed to change too sporadically.  
Either way, I was able to get through it (better than Mitsu x Mitsu Drops, either way, probably around the same story quality as Diabolik Lovers) and there were some funny parts.  
I would recommend this if: you're  not big on consent, you want to watch for the sex scenes, you like yaoi, you like aphrodisiac plot bunnies 
I would NOT recommend this if: you are looking for something artsy and classy, you want something deep, you do not like sex scenes 
In the end, I will probably never watch this again and I'm a little miffed that I spent time doing it. Oh well. 
Have a great day everyone!

REVIEW: The Art for an --'s film was superb, very very detailed, the animations are very fluid and nothing is ever kept still. The backgrounds were all moving and alive. It's beautiful but there's a lot of gore and guts too so watchers beware. Even by today's standards only a few can match the art of Akira. Now the plot is complex but well made and is very imaginative, the anime did a great job of showing that to the film. The only problem with the plot is its fast pacing which kinda ruined the character development, maybe because they have crammed a lot of manga material into a - hour film. I'm sure the manga is better and will explain things a lot better (more character development and on what happens after and before the movie) and I'm hoping that I can read it one of these days. The Concept of having God-like powers is explored quite well, they showed that with greater power, the more isolated someone will be. He/she will transcend into something not human, and might view humans as mere animals or insects.(Of course his/her perspective will change they way Tetsou's did as he was able to kill one of his friends without hesitation). Overall I am very pleased with the movie and was amazed by the art and plot. If you like Psychological, Scifi and Thriller then this one is for you, The plot is kinda heavy but if your like me (who loves seinen btw) you'll enjoy this.

What is a crime? what makes a person bad? do you consider yourself a bad person? what's keeping you from doubting strangers? to put it simply, how likely are you to commit a crime? science has gone pretty far in all kind of fields, you have your weaponry enhancement, realistic holograms, medical miracles, and most importantly, scientific psychology, and yes, it has gotten to the point where you can predict according to some mathematical black magic the chances of someone committing a crime so that they can be prevented from doing so before they even attempt it, crazy what you can accomplish with science huh? this is the crazy life later in the --nd century, where everyone's lives from birth to death is being scheduled by obscure calculations taking in regards many states of the human mind's state, called Psycho-pass, talk about police brutality, you're in a treat for that watching this show, well, at least bad people are being put down to prevent massive casualties, after all, that massive of an AI is more accurate in its examinations, and is by consequence far from making any mistakes, or is it? 
- Story (-/--): 
This is Japan, an isolated country pretty far in the future, with its scientific advancements, it eases the life of its citizens in many ways, the most vital one being security. National safety is being controlled by a system called “The Sibyl system”, consisted of squads of inspectors with the help of latent criminals to take down people who are a danger to society, one day, a young and cheerful girl joins as a rookie inspector, setting a goal for herself to provide as much service she can, but the circumstances brought her to the most unfortunate first case anyone would beg for which completely opened her eyes on the gruesome reality she's living in. the story follows Akane Tsunemori and her squad, solving cases casually, until they hit the big fish, that helps bring the story a full circle, with a very, very rewarding ending. 
- Art (-/--): 
Truly, a work of big-budget production, you can't really complain about the facial expressions or the anatomy, everything is put into perspective, the characters are drawn in a very appealing way, and the animation adds that sweet touch of sugar on top of the cake. 
The lightning and the dark color tone really helps blend the character with the backgrounds very atmospherically. 
There was a very emphasis on the use of CG animations, it looks nice nevertheless, but there were few exceptions where it just looked awful and out of place. 
- Sound (-/--): 
Very fast paced, and as dark as the story itself, this show has one of those scores that you would want to record and play afterward while you're meditating, practicing your hobbies, or just for the sake of enjoyment, and don't get me started on the intros and outros, the first ones has got to be the greatest I've ever heard, and the voice acting was on point for the major part, I watched the English DUB version, and I'm not complaining. 
- Character (--/--): 
I couldn't give it a more fitting score than this one, man, there were a lot of rich characters to go through, except for the main one, Akane while not being that great of a character, her colleagues really do shine, and I'm not speaking about the supposedly “good” side, but god the antagonist was one of the greatest villains you'd find in anime, his sarcasm and ideology were on top of the charts, only followed by the protagonist, Shinya. 
one thing they did great with Akane, is her development, you really get that sense of change, from the naive little puppy that just breached into the crime scene, to the fully mature inspector, who sees her job more seriously than ever. 
- Enjoyment (-/--): 
Totally worth the watch, this is one of those shows that lure you to binge them all, but don't fall into the trap, the fun resides on the partly watch, only then you can take the most out of the story, and focus more on its aspects, there is a lot going on once the story kicks in, so you are in for a treat. 
- Overall (-.-/--): 
I still think I'm going hard on this one, I should have been more toleratable in giving it a --/--, but that's only something the second sequel can decide, I'd totally recommend this to the people who like dark fiction, there are a lot of aspects of gore, sexual content, and twisted turns of events, watch it on your risk, you, and only you are responsible on your Psycho-pass.

[This has been updated after watching all - episodes] 
Mahoutsukai no Yome feels good to watch. With this - episode OVA we are introduced to a magical world that is just sheer beauty in all of it's qualities.  
I believe these episodes are a prequel to the full length anime that is coming in October.  
So far, the story feels inviting, exciting, relatable and quite familiar. We are introduced to Chise and her troubled past and how she has gotten to where she will be in the anime. The story of the outcast that is misunderstood and thrown to the side is one that will captivate you, albeit a familiar story. The magical nature of it all makes it that much more dynamic and really draws you in quite close.  
In a lot of the moments, from the story to the art direction, it reminded me of Studio Ghibli works, so you must know that it is a wonderful thing to watch.  
The world is quite complex, and we have yet to fully understand all of it, but so far all the elements flow well between each other and all the pieces fit well together in this initial setup. You can't help but feel for the young Chise as she is wandering hopelessly seeking some sense of peace. 
The first two episodes did a lot of the set up. The first laying the map, the second giving much of what happens, and the third is now the conclusion. I must say that the second episode is clearly the best as far as plot development is concerned, but with the third, we get a lot more emotion going on. It concludes the beginning of Chise's story and provides a little more background, but it was a satisfying conclusion before the anime is begins next month.  
It's tragic and quite beautiful all at the same time. You won't regret sitting through these prequel episodes and it truly has me excited for the series that is to follow quite soon. There is love, loss, magic, obstacles, evil and beauty all wrapped up in a story that follows the relationship between two beings on opposite ends of the spectrum. Some may see it as a nuanced anime version of the Beauty and the Beast. You won't regret tuning in and catching this OVA.

Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage 
The second part of Black Lagoon, but it's splitted as a second season for some reason, follows another day in the episodic life of the Black Lagoon gang, another day but focused more on Revy and Rock and less Dutch and Benny. 
Story 
The same as the first part, it has episodic stories that are a mess at giving a contundent conclusion and rising questions, just like Eda's identity is revealed i was expecting a story with her, but no, her motives are unknown, the first three episodes are sad, i felt sorry for Hansel and Gretel, it was really sad and to think that happens in real life too and seeing their fates made me shed some tears, maybe the best eps. of this Second Barrage, those eps. had story behind it, a deep and really really dark one and a dark conclusion; The next eps. are good with another different story but with Eda's identity revealed and in the next ep. nothing about that, a different story again this time in Japan and Revy's clothes changed too, it's refreshing and she looked really good; Rock and Revy gets closer and you can see Revy cares a lot for Rock in her own way (she even gets jealous when Eda flirts with Rock or doesn't want to talk about it when Eda asks Revy if they banged or when he was talking with Yukio) and that story in Japan was good, but it would be better if it had more eps. it ended like a normal ep. like giving you the impression that there's going to be another ep. that was not a good ending. Well after the ending and the ED song, Eda asks her again if she finally banged him because they had a lot of time to do it and Revy said she didn't wanted to talk about it and was ashamed and angry at the question, it was kind of funny because she never tries but acts more kind towards him than before, not getting angry at him like she used to, those stories were good, the first one was great, the second story didn't have a conclusion and the third one felt almost the same, but i was'' so where is the next episode?''. 
Art & Animation 
Art style is the same, it's very good, great animation and details, more blood than the first part with a liitle more violence, and with great character design. 
Sound 
Almost the same but i expected more with the music, very good VA but a little clumsy with the english when Rock had to work as Balalaika's translator, i barely understood her, not just her but every one who attempted to speak in english because they didn't know each others languages. The same amazing OP, i got obsessed pausing the video clip at sec. -- she had something and i was trying to find out why i liked that shot so much, maybe because you won't see her like that in the anime, every episode pausing at that sec. for half an hour... there are three ED the same one from the first part/season and the one that will make you drop a tear the one from ep. -- and the one from the last ep... in general was very good. 
Character 
I enjoyed much more Revy on this second barrage, she was less heartless, a little, but she really was better than before and treats Rock better and protects him. 
-Rock is better too and he starts to find out who he is and where he stands. 
-Mr. Chang is a confirmed badass. 
-Shenhua's voice is funny, i love the way she talks, she is a cool character. 
-Balalaika is ruthless than ever, she is greedy for war, i liked the addition of Sawyer (she reminded me of the girl from Nazo no Kanojo X) and Ginji, cool character and not to mention the darker characters like Hansel and Gretel with a really dark past, hevy stuff, it was a heavy story and Yukio's end was... she should have stopped, that end wouldn't happened if she... and there's not much of Dutch unfortunately, not Benny neither but he only appears two times and he already has a girlfriend Janet the clumsy Indian girl. 
Enjoyment 
I enjoyed more this second barrage than the first -- eps. it was a little better, but the action was much enjoyable, although i feel it should be tagged as supernatural, because c'mon is obvious why, eg, Gretel a girl who wields a heavy machinegun and handles it like a boss without hurting herself, or Roberta in the first part/season is basically terminator... Revy was much ''nicer'' more likeable, more relaxed and badass than before, Revy is quite something unique and sexy, adding the - Omakes which were funny and good i got a great enjoyment.

First, if you are deciding between watching the --episode series or the single-movie version, pick the movie. It being marked as a ""summary"" of the series on MAL might mislead you to think it is a cut-down version, but that is not the case. I noticed a few removed scenes exactly at the places where episodes were stitched together, but they are mostly insignificant compared to what has replaced them. The movie also has an extra scene at the very start, an interesting slideshow of images during the credits, and an entirely new after-credits scene (that might be the only thing that you should watch in both versions). 
Now about the show itself: 
The subject of future AI closing the gap with humans and the many questions that come with it is an old one, and often goes hand in hand with some common and even cliched pitfalls. This show might serve as a good start to get you thinking on those questions if you've not seen or read much else on the topic or have not thought about it much before, but it also doesn't go particularly deep into it and doesn't seem to avoid the typical flaws either. If you try to go into too much details, it will leave you wanting and you'll spot a lot of open questions, loose ends and even plot holes. Here the extra scenes you'll find in the movie version compared to the series version are worth mentioning again - even though they don't really answer much, and might actually add even more questions, they at least hint at an attempt to tie the lose ends as part of some larger story and world-building that remains outside of the movie instead of downright ignoring them, which sates my dissatisfaction to a degree. 
So, if I remind myself to not get too nit-picky and consider the level of details that's possible to include in a show as short as this, I must say I quite like it. I'm also keeping my hopes up for an eventual continuation or at least an English translation of the light novel on which it is based.

Where to begin. Black Lagoon may in fact be the worst animation ever, and it boggled the mind that someone felt a second season was necessary. Just as well, I feel it is my duty to the MAL community to help cease the spread of misinformation that seems to be plaguing the internet about this ""series"" (and i use the term loosely I assure you) 
Story:- Basically it's just American garbage of run around and shoot everything that is in sight. Clearly, the creators of this atrocity felt the need to service the lowest common denominator. I find it rather insulting to be honest, that someone out there thinks so little of my intelligence that this filth could pass as a ""story"" of intrigue. 
Art:- We have seen it all before I'm afraid, colors in between dark lines, however this particular animator was quite inconsistent and down right boorish with their animations. 
Sound:- I suppose guns and explosions all sound the same. 
Characters:- This is my main grievance with this garbage, it is the fact at how one dimensional and flat the characters are. Their motives are spoon fed to us and the exposition that is thrown into our faces leave little to the imagination, as if we are required to have everything spelled out for us. No depth at all, just a bunch of shallow, empty puppets who are placed in their specific roles. 
Enjoyment:- For reasons stated above. 
Overall:- Stay away if you value your time and dignity.

Will Grenadier's service with a smile put one on your face? 
Grenadier is a manga series by Sosuke Kaise. Halfway through its initial publishing run from ---- to ----, it received a twelve episode anime adaption by Group TAC. 
It's pretty short, so Grenadier is an easy show to pick up. Whether or not it's worth it is what shall soon be found out.  
Visuals: 
The artwork in Grenadier is fairly consistent and doesn't show too many quality issues. It's never very detailed, but does have fairly vibrant colors. The majority of detail is devoted to the characters, but only the female characters show some degree of good character design. One character in particular tries too hard to make up for this and has a gigantic zipper to compensate for the designer's lack of creativity. Nearly everyone else looks fairly generic and bland, which also seems to go hand-in-hand with Grenadier's level of animation. 
The animation is not anything to brag about. Scenic shots are infrequent and close-ups of someone's face commonly fill the screen. This is never overdone to a point of being too noticeable, but it is an aspect of the animation that could have been improved upon. Action scenes play with a delicate balance of movement and fairly still, panning-shots. Scenes like Rushuna's unique way of reloading a gun always play out the same, but are frequently animated a little differently at some point, which is nice. In the end, the animation is mediocre. It's not bad at all, but it's enough to show that Grenadier didn't have a high budget. The visuals, however, can't be the only place Grenadier had to spread out its budget. Sound is something everyone has to focus on as well. 
Sound: 
Nothing really stands out in the sound department of Grenadier. Each character's voice is normally well suited to their appearance in both the English dub and the original Japanese audio. The only downside to the English dub is that AnimeWorks felt it was necessary to add extra words into the translation so that each character's flapping lips fit the amount of syllables in a sentence. This means dialogue is often wordy and very cheesy since nobody speaks like you'd expect in a normal conversation. The voices themselves are fine, but the Japanese audio with English subtitles is recommended if you want more natural dialogue. 
Outside the fairly generic OP and ED, the music chooses to let itself lie in the electronica category and shower the listener with some fairly nice techno beats. The combat themes in particular are exciting to listen to and fit the battle sequences well. Unfortunately, the theme that plays during a couple of the goofier moments in the show was incredibly short and repetitive and stood out from the rest of the soundtrack as very annoying. 
Characters: 
The characters of the show are a fairly uninteresting bunch. The only ones who stand out are the two main characters, and even they have problems. 
For instance, Rushuna is a pretty enjoyable character at first. One may find where she stores her ammo a very entertaining factor of the show, but aside from her quirky personality, entertaining antics, and... full character design, she simply lacks a proper backstory and any kind of character development. This isn't always needed to make a character interesting or entertaining, but one could debate that her lack of development makes her a flat character. On the other hand, her traveling partner, Yajiro, turns out quite a bit rounder than she does. 
Yajiro is the only character to receive any real development. He changes drastically throughout the show and does receive some interesting backstory to explain his initial motives and ideals. Unfortunately, his main flaw is that he's a little more than useless at times. This isn't actually a flaw of his character, but one of the show itself. Grenadier simply forgets to involve him in the combat and sometimes chooses to save Yajiro's usefulness for a later time get Rushuna out of a jam. Like the animation, this problem doesn't always happen. Yajiro does get some action, but he's left out of enough of it to be noticeable. The show even has the audacity to introduce a third main character later on, the token loli, whose sole purpose is to provide Yajiro and Rushuna with a cheap method of escape whenever they back into a corner. 
Along with the main villain of the show and the supporting cast, nearly everyone else gives the viewer very little reason to show interest. If the characters of Grenadier are weak, then what's the main focus of the show? Maybe this is where the plot comes in... 
Plot: 
More than half of the show follows the episodic villain routine. The usual set-up is that Rushuna arrives somewhere new and has to solve a problem that crops up, which is usually due to a villain causing problems. The only real problem here is that the majority of these episodes rely on shallow plot, villains, and supporting characters to move  Rushuna and Yajiro further towards the end of the show. Fortunately, each episode makes sure to include something relevant to the main story to keep things moving. 
The thing is, whenever Grenadier stops focusing on the plot and pauses to show Rushuna and Yajiro simply interacting with each other, the show is at its best. The comedy here is plentiful, but not all of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Most of the time, they're dull and feel intrusive. As if to make up for its lack of humor, though, one good joke will drop in during every other episode. It's not enough, but after sitting through the rest of the show the occasionally good comedic scene will bring a smile to one's face. In fact, there's one scene towards the end that had me roaring with laughter, and was the only scene in the entire series where I opened my mouth and physically let out a laugh. 
Grenadier drops its episodic villain routine near the end of the series, and the action begins to heat up. Battles and verbal debates about war and peace ensue, one side character from an earlier episode shows up (but turns out to be useless), and a couple of plot twists reveal themselves. Did these moments come too late into the show to be of any significance? The answer is: yes. The final two episodes really feel like a slightly more elaborate filler that drops the ending in front of you and leaves. The best part of the final episode was the unveiling of a new villain. After a surprisingly wonderfully animated fight scene, the show ends. What about that new villain? Where did she come from? What's her story? Why didn't we see more of her before? None of these questions are answered, we're just introduced to her, given an action scene, and then the show wraps everything up. In other words, as soon as someone interesting came in, Grenadier was unable to handle the inexplicably weird idea of grabbing the viewer's interest and threw in the towel. 
So just what was Grenadier trying to accomplish? 
Conclusion: 
Grenadier is rife with fan-service. There's never any full-on nudity, but you can expect Rushuna to enjoy at least one bath scene per episode. There's nothing wrong with a bit of cleavage nor the fact that Rushuna actually uses her assets for a practical purpose (hammerspace), but you can bet that fan-service was Grenadier's main goal, not its plot. 
Perhaps the series' secondary goal was its theme. It's not hard to uncover, but the message it tries to get across is that to resolve situations, our first priority should be to act kind and love one another. It's pretty sappy, but Rushuna Tendou makes it clear that showing other people kindness and respect is the most important part of a conflict. If we try to understand each others view first, a peaceful solution is a more likely result; if it ends in war, at least we've already displayed our strongest weapon. 
Despite my complaints, I did somewhat enjoy Grenadier. It had its moments, it had its jokes, and it had an alright theme. Rushuna Tendou and Yajiro Kojima may be the only good part of the show, but at least it has something going for it. Still, if you want to watch something about a blonde outlaw looking for world peace, I'd recommend you look around for an outlaw named Vash the Stampede.

This is a masterpiece, brilliant, and so damn underrated anime. Let's see how. 
First, the characters are lovely and strange. They take the story to an offbeat level. No typical romantic comedy stuff, no exaggerated expressions, no normal talk at all. People like to call Hachiman and Yukino philosophers but I don't think that's right. 
So basically, the anime is about how you deal with life. Loneliness, friends, society, and the ""methods"" of solving problems. You won't find anything interesting if you're not good with appreciating a philosophical approach to life. 
But if you're like me and a bit different than the rest, THIS IS THE ANIME BITCHES. BETTER WATCH IT BEFORE YOU DIE AND THANK ME LATER. SERIOUSLY. I AM SO DAMN SERIOUS TRUST ME. 
I cannot put my limited knowledge to any use here to tell you whether you will like it or not. You have try watching and either love it or drop it.

Ok so now I've already finish this one off special thingy, what do I have to say? 
First of all info states that this -- min special is actually set between the -th and -th episode of its parent anime. I quite disgusting that studio Bones have to waste it's time making some OVA that should have been included a part of the parent anime's episode, it is also a waste of time for us audience that we're made to wait for a little bit longer for the parent anime's last - episode and this stupid studio wants us to watch an OVA which should have been shown along with the parent anime's episode. Wtf was going on within the mind of Tomoki Kyoda's the director of Eureka - Ao? Frankly to make such a meaningful review of this thing would be useless, since it would be nothing more that being in a forum, and this review ain't a review but more of a rant against studio Bones and the director Tomoki Kyoda. 
My ratings: 
Story: Mediocre -. 
Since this OVA is more like a filler episode to compensate for the much awaited last - episode of its parent anime. 
Art: Mediocre -. 
Isn't obvious, btw, I hate the idea that Ao was made to dress up like a girl and the swimsuit fanservice sucks. 
Sound: Mediocre -. 
No comment here. 
Character: Mediocre -. 
Since most of the characters are still there prior to Ao's used of the quartz gun. 
Enjoyment: Fair -. 
Ok, so this OVA as a filler was a bit funny after seeing Ao, Fleur and Elena on a trip to attend some cosplay festival in Switzerland, but have dodge a pesky reported, and that's as good as it gets. 
Overall: Pathetic -. 
The introduction of this OVA is simply a case of too little, too late.......unless of course one would wanna buy a blu ray disc of this anime. The studio should have just proceeded with the parent anime's last - episode instead of making us audience wait till November, studio Bones really sucks.

Really Clannad is really amazing. 
The story wasn't the best, it really was just a guy who gets friends with some girls. And has encounters and experiences with all of them.  
The art was fantastic, I think its the best art Ive seen, nothing has ever beat it. 
The sound was great, I cant say to much about it. 
The character was the best, each one had there little own personality. You could recognize who it was by there voice and there art design. They were all really developed. They all also had their really weird likings and interests. 
I really enjoyed this anime a lot, i would suggest it to the people who know what anime is not those Shonen-Action-tards.

This one was recommended to me by a friend, so give it a try I did. Although the concept of kids with special powers has been done to death, and the silly convienience of these powers only being available in your teenage years, I was still interested in what direction they would take it. 
I immediately hated the selfish main character and how he used his power of taking over someones body for - seconds, to his own benefit, I mean that's realistic, most people would do that, but in an anime, I prefer my main character to be a goodie goodie do-no-wrong, I want him to set an example. Afterall you want someone you like, to be the lead, right? 
(I didn't like the female lead either, she was just as big of an asshole, but I tried to look away from that) 
Regardless, he quickly gets transfered to a school for kids like him, where he is forced into the student council, whose mission it is to hunt down other kids with special powers, and either enroll them in their school or convince them to never use their powers again, as doing so will put them in danger of getting captured by the government who will experiment on them. As I write this, I am actually surprised why this plotpoint wasn't explored more. 
Initially, I got bored rather quickly, as ep --- became a ""monster of the week"" kinda spiel, where the kids hunt down a new power user, beat them at their own game, convince them to stop using their power - lather rinse repeat. 
It didn't really move the story forward at all, except maybe some minor character development, and it wasn't until episode - that it began getting good. 
I won't get into spoilers, but when it finally started, almost halfway through the show, I was actually really hooked and invested in what on earth would happen next, as I now cared for the characters. It shouldn't take that long for an only -- episodes long anime to get interesting in my opinion, but better late than never I guess. 
Overall I liked it after it finally kicked off, but what disappointed me the most, was that the --th episode, was completely rushed. It had material and potential to be an entire -nd season on its own, but was rushed to conclude the series. In all honesty, I would rather pretend it didn't exist, and have the series end openly in ep --. 
If you like ""teens with powers"" and time travel plots, by all means give it a watch. It is not the best anime you'll ever watch, but I personally walked away satisfied, I was glad I had watched it.

It's just pathetic.. and totally horrible 
Once you just watch this series could possibly ticks you off very badly not because it's a slice of life theme which is much more focuses to a little girl as miko and a talking bear. That's it? No no no you may been wandering about the  
changes of Machi through every episode right? 
Her anxiety just got even worst, which unrelated to others that she's seeking help but they aren't few people can trust her. It's just felt wrong to see her like that. 
All those gimmick makes me throw off, especially the ending, Director what happened? You make the series just left like that? A country bumpkin became isolated by going into the city. Gosh pls no this is not what I wanted. 
Moving on, to the jokes here. Seriously those PEDOJOKES just needs to stop, It's deliberately sarcasm bad humor. How crappy for you to understand the whole plot of this show anyway. Meaningless as if the main thing here is all about Machi's anxiety gone completely different every episode. 
Never heard this got dark until the last scenario. Despite by getting traumatized to face reality, her most precious day just end with a complete blunt.

Ore ga Kanojo wo *su Wake is an OVA series by Suzuki Mirano.  Before I get into this review, I'll state my opinion outright.  This hentai is bad, both objectivly, and subjectively.  After watching the final episode, I had an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth.  However, I waited a bit to write this review.   
The final episode had yet to be subbed into English, and my understanding of Japanese is... well... lacking.  And there was a year long gap between episodes - and -, so I wanted to refresh my memory.  After binging the series, my outlook on it softened somewhat.  But I also found new problems, which we shall discuss. 
What's the story for this OVA?  Well, it's all about this whiney spoiled brat named Rinka, who runs away from home and crashes at her uncle's place.  Her uncle happens to have a jealous crush on Rinka's mom (and he's most likely clinically insane), and by this point in my summery you can probably guess the whole story from here on out.  Yep, it's NTR, or at least it would be.  Instead, several episodes are spent on Rinka fucking around with her uncle (pun very much intended).  Let's call these ""filler episodes"", because they're some of the most boring shlock I've ever sat through.  Literally nothing of value happens.  And when the plot actually picks up again, it's an absolute trainwreak.  The story is worthless, and that's all there is to it. 
The art/animation is the only decent aspect of this dumpster fire.  It's by no means great, but it could be much worse.  The art is pretty bland, and if you want to get the best out of it, watch it in HD.  Because even the slightest downgrades make it look awful.  It does have one redeeming quality (though not one to be proud of).  The facial expressions look ridiculous, and I'm not sure I've ever laughed this much while watching a hentai.  You have to see them in action to really understand.  The animation is consistent though, which is good.   
The voice actors do a fine job, at least for what they have to work with.  Because the script is shit.  The dialog is painfully bland, and some of it's just plain cringe-worthy! 
The characters are awful.  There's Rinka, who's an annoying brat and a bucket of wasted potential.  Then there's Rinka's mom, and her only personality trait is that she's a whore.  And not to mention Rinka's uncle, who I'm certain is a mass shooter waiting to happen.  There's also Rinka's dad... and yeah, he does nothing.  Rinka also gets it on with some other randos, but they're not important.  As I hinted earlier, I think Rinka had some potential to be an interesting character, or at least have a satisfying arc.  Early on It's established that Rinka has some sort of crush on her dad, and she pretty much betrays him for the rest of the story.  But then she starts to realize that she's just being used by her uncle.  I thought this plot point was going to be picked up again in the final episode, you know, to bring things full circle.  But no.  Instead we got a terrible ending, that spits in the face of anyone who gave a damn and though some effort might actually go into the story. 
Overall, I didn't enjoy this OVA series.  It had some relatively good scenes sprinkled throughout, but they were littered in a sea of mediocrity.  I was bored through much of this, and it didn't offer much of anything good.  I'm of the opinion that the final two episodes (which were released more than a year after the others) made the series even worse.  All in all, this was pretty bad.  -.-/-- 
So, would I reccomend you watch this trash?  Well, it's objectively bad, but you might still get something out of it if you're into NTR or rape.  Otherwise, steer clear for the time being.

I... give this anime full marks!! WOOOO!!! haha 
Sorry if you find some error in this review. 
Mo dao zu shi or Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation is a donghua or animation from China adapted from a Chinese novel with the same name, also have the manhua ( Chinese manga ). 
So, this is my score for this Donghua 
Story: --/--, This animation has a very good plot on it. at first, I don't know specifically how the plot is... But I got interested by the trailer, so just mark it as my plan to watch list. I got curious and then starts to find the manhua and novel. And read it. I'm like ""WOW"". 
Characters: --/--, I think the characters are well-drawn. I'm very satisfied with their characteristics. If you ask me what my most favourites character is, then I will say its Lan WangJi. 
Sounds: --/--, I think I love their opening and ending of this animation. It can tell that they're singing these songs are full of passion. I love it a lot. 
Art: --/--, for this animation, I think its very good. I love their animation each background, especially in Gusu Lan Sect. It's very very well-drawn. Not only the background, of course, the characters art too.  
Overall Enjoyment: --/--, for me a fan of this genre animation, I'm very enjoyable on the stories of Lan WangJi and Wei Wuxian. You can tell that they so love each other. Also, there are some scenes are touching my heart a lot. Sad, Happy, Touching, Heartwarming is flowing inside this animation. This animation has resided on my favourites animation. 
For who wants to continue the story, Look for the novel. You will know more amazing and specific things there.

The way I look at Charlotte is like a show that started off buzzing with potentially well-thought ideas. Then as time went on, it really crashed and burned. Like almost pouring rice.  
Charlotte, an original show conceived by Jun Maeda, is a series made by Aniplex and P.A. Works. The series takes place in a world where a small percentage of people manifest supernatural powers. While this hardly sounds original, Charlotte does have a unique presence with its characters. Yuu Otosaka, a first year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, developed his ability to possess others temporarily and made himself a fake academic honor student. The first episode establishes himself as a narcissistic individual who uses his powers for personal gains.  
Now, this actually sounds kind of like a neat idea. The ability to possess others can really have a dominating effect especially for someone like Yuu. Early episodes establish him using this ability with some dangerous risks. That is until we have a girl named Nao Tomori who catches Yuu using his ability and forces him to join the student council in order to help others with these unique abilities. Like Yuu though, Nao also shows a narcissistic side of herself and for some reason lacks female friends. A good portion of Charlotte shows her using a camera filming events around her life. Joining them includes Jojiro Takajo, a boy who can apparently move at supersonic speed, and Yusa Nishimori, a popular idol singer who can channel the dead. As part of the early phases, the show takes on a slice of life focus. Every episode essentially shows the members of the student council use their ability to help others and prevent troublemakers from causing chaos. This sometimes comes at high risk as some abilities can be quite dangerous. And as such, the show maintains a somewhat dark side with some minor foreshadowing. Furthermore, we are also introduced to Yuu’s little sister Ayumi, who is like an energetic light bulb that can brighten anyone’s day; figuratively of course.  
With a small cast of main characters such as this, Charlotte essentially had a good story going. Yes, some of the episodes feels like distractions that incorporate generic school life activities such as baseball or outdoor camping trips. However, the show originally maintained a cool level of comedy. It can make the viewer laugh such as with Joiro’s over-exaggerated expressions of his obsession towards Yusa. Ayumi can also be likable at times with her bright personality that seemingly has some influences towards others. Everything originally was standard and then, trouble hits. 
I guess it shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Jun Maeda is known for his involvement in Key related works. These include Kanon, Air, and Clannad. Some recurring themes include family values, magical realism, and his intention to draw tears from the viewers with emotional scenarios. So here for Charlotte, it really isn’t much of a surprise that there’s a familiar trend. The first few episodes sets up a lot of fun and actually works hand in hand. Then, the second half of the show kicks into a darker tone with the story. And to be quite frank honest, it feels like the show got possessed. It turns into a series that forcefully tries to draw out emotional impact starting with Yuu’s depression. There is a good reason for this but the transitional direction of his character really is an oddball. Furthermore, Yuu’s role becomes somewhat like a savior to protect a certain someone. It’s like Yuu almost became another person as the story progresses. The turning point of the series makes Yuu look like a hero but is really one? Honestly no. In fact, Yuu is more of the anti-hero and without a certain person’s help, I fear what he really may become. The recurring themes written by Jun Maeda comes into full hold as we get alternate worlds, timelines, and loops. And in general, the show changes way too much for its own good. A major problem I found throughout the latter half of the story is the numerous plot holes that appears out of nowhere. Furthermore, there are the continuous jokes that becomes apparently blend after seeing it so many times. The mood of the story constantly changes from one point to another that eventually becomes almost intolerable. It’s also fairly predictable and has some fairly anti-climactic resolutions to problems. Despite this, I do give Charlotte some credit for taking the risk. I think the show is more suited for certain audiences that appreciates the writing style of Jun Maeda. Otherwise, Charlotte will take some enormous patience especially to get answers to wanted questions. These include the meaning of Charlotte, how Yuu’s relationship with others changes, and what true essence of some of the characters’ powers are. As with I mentioned earlier on, there’s a strong uphold about family values that is easily carved out with Yuu and Ayumi’s relationship. 
Speaking of relationships, the most noticeable one is probably Yuu and Nao throughout the series. In several ways, they are similar but hard to get along. Yuu’s change builds a more stable relationship with her as time goes on. However, when it comes to love or romance, the series drops the ball. You’ll have to see it for yourself but it’s something that’s easily forgettable. That also brings back to my earlier problems with the show. Some of the characters establishes their presence such as Zhiend’s singer but are later seemingly forgotten. There could have been a more meaningful relationship that they can forge and leave viewers to remember for. Instead, too many things happen at once and the final few episodes really seems like it’s trying to fit everything into a box. Yuu’s attempt to become some sort of savior makes me feel like he really isn’t suitable for the job. And lastly, I think the glasses guy (Tokajo) and Yusa’s relevance in the series slipped like sands of an hourglass. Of course, their relationship hardly moved an inch.  
Now I will say this. Charlotte makes its name and presence known with its high level production values. Once again, we see the colorful style of P.A. Works’ characters and a few of the scenes in the show can be described as scenery porn. While the character designs are usually generic, the powers themselves holds a dominating presence. Yuu’s ability to possess others is heightened by the way the art is done with his eyes while there’s also neat camera focuses of characters’ facial expressions. The OP and ED theme song has a mystical presence that invests on its show’s themes and foreshadowing. As such, the cinematography and overall animation for Charlotte is exceptional and is something to remember. 
When a show mixes in comedy and tragedy, you’ll need to transit both with a fitting way to match the presentation. While not as strong as its artwork, Charlotte’s soundtrack works well on most parts. Dialogues matches with character voice mannerisms and the OST in general is easy to keep up with depending on the shift of the tone. For voice mannerism itself, the characters are represented in a tolerable way whether it’s Yuu’s narcissism, Ayumi’s hyperactive energy, Yusa’s charming personality, or even her other self, who is almost a complete opposite of Yusa’s character. The show also retains some musical themes as introduced in later episodes although the songs can be questionably enjoyable. For all other things though, Charlotte’s soundtrack is satisfactory without breaking the limits. 
Charlotte is pretty much a show that is hard to accept. I think taking Charlotte for granted for what it is originally was easier for some people but as the story progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to tolerate. This is evidenced by its sharp turn in characterization, story mood changes, and reused ideas coming from Jun Maeda. As a show that tries far too hard to induce drama or tear-jerking moments, it really didn’t succeed in such a way. Now I will admit though, Charlotte’s comedy can make the fans laugh a bit and the premise can seem to be interesting. The first few episodes were really fun to watch and although had a plotless direction focused well on what it is. Just be aware that the second half of the show will take a drastic change and whether you like it or not, it’s hard to adapt with. And honestly, that’s a certain kind of blunder.

Are many of us afraid to become a NEET or a hikikomori nowadays? You know, where you basically don’t go to college or have a job, not contributing to society as most people calls it and instead you’re living off your parents for money, becoming closed off to the world, anti-social to everyone you know (or at least that’s what most people think of being anti-social, but mostly to the people you don’t give a shit about) and basically you’re referred to as a freak? Yeah, I’m not going to sugarcoat this but this does exist in the world and it can discourage you at most times during the time of your adult life. It can happen to anyone through anything. 
Tatsuhiro Satou, a -- year old young man, is a NEET (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) and a hikikomori (meaning acute social withdrawal). He believes everything around him is a conspiracy, including the reason why many people, himself included, become hikikomori. Due to this, Satou (mostly influenced in his high school days by Hitomi Kashiwa, or as he calls her Senpai, yes, someone actually uses that word. Make all the “I hope somebody-Senpai notices me” jokes you want) creates a strange conspiracy theory which includes the Nihon Hikikomori Kyōkai (NHK), a secret organization with the intention of producing a hikikomori filled world. Satou intends to break free from the NHK's clutches, but cannot, since he finds it too frightening to go outdoors by him; that is, until he meets Misaki Nakahara, who selects Satou for her ""project"" that she claims will cure him of his hikikomori ways and yet he wants to prove to her that he’s not one by telling her he’s a stay-at-home game designer working on his next project with the help of his irritable next-door neighbor Kaoru Yamazaki, who seems like a NEET but actually goes to a school and a bit more stable than Satou but still messed up in the head. 
Now, the premise of the series does seem a bit odd like why did somebody think of this in the first place, leading them to thinking that this would not work at all but in actuality, it fits perfectly fine as the series goes along with the tone of dark humor involving tropes and references of anime, online gaming, manga, and conspiracy theories among those. Somebody going outside of their world, feeling strange to surroundings that they are not familiar with and trying not to fail connecting or crossing in that world seems new to the world of anime since I’m not sure if anyone uses that concept before, maybe in a few movies or TV series but not in an anime before. 
Character-wise, the show mainly has the focus on four main characters and that’s what I’m going to do. Sato is an idiot, but I can’t say he wasn’t relatable or unlikable to anyone out there and not the stereotype of what most people think of NEETs. He may be a hikikomori but his problems are like what every day normal people goes through. It’s another story with Yamazaki, I wanted to feel for this character but sometimes they are reasons why he should get his ass kicked and also close to the stereotype of the reason why geeks and nerds can’t get laid……that and that damn song he played at the beginning of the series got stuck in my head. I do like Misaki as a character since she does have good intentions on helping Satou with the counseling but it is obvious that she has a crush on him, I even spotted that from the beginning of the show. Hitomi may be a part of the past life of Satou but most of the time she’s never relevant in the main plot except for a few episodes in the halfway mark. The dub voices of them by ADV Films were done well by Chris Patton, Luci Christian, Stephanie Wittels & Greg Ayres but I will say for Ayres if you can’t tolerate his voice, then you will hate his character overall. 
The animation of the show is done by Gonzo. Okay, even though Gonzo is known for doing good animation in the earlier stages of an anime and then they’ll fuck it up when they ran out of the animation budget but I don’t hate Gonzo considering the past work I liked from them was Afro Samurai, Afro Samurai: Resurrection & Romeo X Juliet. What I said about Samurai - and their animation, the same can be said for this one but it felt like a better effort put into this since this falls under slice-of-life and they often get bigger budgets. The music is fairly okay with the main score sounds like something out of a Sundance Film Festival entry and the opening of the series is a standard light J-Pop sound but the ending music…….oh, the ending music, I really love the ending song to this because it feels like one acid trip after another but unfortunately, that song only lasts for -- episodes, the other song……I won’t speak of. 
FINAL VERDICT: Welcome to the N.H.K. is a daring series that doesn’t bullshit on the details and it has all the elements of what you expect from an indie comedy-drama movie. I can see some people ranking this as high on their list but I’ll say I consider this a must-see but not something you put in your hall of fame chest. The characters are relatable to an extent where it gets confusedly weird to get to, the animation is good at some times but can be bad and overall, while it can get depressing at some parts, it’s still something that most anime (even non-anime fans that might get into anime) should check out.

I don't know what an NG-shuu is, sounds like some hip Japanese hair product, but this Kuroko's Basketball special series is a collection of short blooper reels ranging around -:----:-- minutes each. As it sounds, it copies several scenes from the anime exactly until they deviate when something goes comically wrong. 
The original Kuroko's Basketball had a decent sense of humor, even if it unfortunately used Japanese wordplay frequently, so it comes as no surprise that these bloopers do have their laugh out loud moments now that the writers are expressly focusing on the humor without having to worry about the tone of the story. These skits are far from equal in quality, but given how short each one it is it hardly feels like time wasted. It can be frustrating how long the original scene is set up to get to the point where the joke is, but that's really all there is to say. These jokes don't give any new insight into the characters, and plenty are situational comedies that have nothing to do with the specific characters, basketball, or the original point of the scene. 
With all that can be said having been said, this is easily recommended to Kuroko's Basketball fans so if you're on the fence about bothering just go ahead and watch already. You'll get at least a laugh or two.

Going into this movie, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The visuals looked great and it was one of the only anime movies I had seen to get a simultaneous world-wide release, streaming on Crunchyroll for those of us in other countries who couldn’t go see it in theaters. Unfortunately, it seems that the release strategy is the biggest praise I can give this movie. 
Story: -/-- 
To put it simply, this is a mixture of a revenge story and a set-up for some presumed sequel story. It feels very much like the first film in a superhero series, the one that sets up the hero and their backstory and lays down the motivations and character traits. Unfortunately, it does this fairly poorly, leaving nothing but a predictable and shallow narrative. I won’t spoil anything, but trust me when I say that what you expect after the first -- minutes is exactly what you get.  
Art: -/-- 
The visuals are quite well done, though they seem to be at a quality I would more often associate with a TV series than a full movie. The art does its job, most of the character animation is good, but doesn’t stand out as anything too special. Some of the visual design is quite interesting, particularly the effects used for the animal drones and the camo outfits, but nothing you can’t find elsewhere. One thing to note is that the -D used here is very uninspired and stands out like a sore thumb. I am a fan of -D when it is used well, Houseki no Kuni and Last Exile being excellent examples of how to do -D properly. This is not one of them. Even in the opening credits we can see really cheap looking character models in the backgrounds, and it is very distracting and unintentionally humorous. 
Sound/Music: -/-- 
The audio of this film is truly the only thing I fully enjoyed. The music is well done, fits the mood, and makes you feel like what you are watching is actually something to get excited over. The sound design is also good, though seems to be muddled a bit by the constant bombastic score of the music. Not that bombastic music is an issue, especially in what is essentially a superhero movie. Unfortunately, while the music is good, it feels as though it could be slapped into any futuristic action/adventure movie and it would fit just as well. 
Character:  -/-- 
The characters are interesting in their own right, though the quality varies greatly. The protagonist(s) are fairly well designed and like-able, both in design and personality. However, the antagonist(s) are incredibly predictable and uninspired. They feel as though they were ripped straight out of a bargain ----’s western comic book and then painted with an even more boring coat of paint. They are one of my biggest gripes with the movie as a whole, to the point that not even a good protagonist can help. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Despite my massive gripes with the story, there is still some enjoyment to be had here. You do have to take the entire movie for what it is, however: a cheese-fest superhero origin story. I found myself smiling at certain parts, especially in the first -- minutes, but that quickly trickled off into a fairly constant stream of face-palms toward the end. 
Overall: -/-- 
I would only really recommend this movie to fans of western superheroes. It gives off a very strong Marvel superhero group vibe, so if you are a fan of that and can look past the predictable and lazy story, then perhaps you will find some enjoyment here. Unfortunately for me, I hate everything to do with the western superhero “genre”, and this movie did nothing more than remind me of why I do. I’m sure there will be lots of people out there that enjoy this a lot, and if that’s you, then great. As for me, I don’t plan on revisiting this any time soon. Perhaps a sequel (or series) could flesh things out and provide a more interesting plot, but I have my doubts.

DISCLAIMER: I haven't read any of Sir Edogawa's work when I wrote the review for this anime. 
Ranpo Kitan is an anime coming from the mystery genre which produced Un-Go, Hyouka and Case Closed. The show's setup was good enough. The characters are quirky enough. The premise of the mysteries was creepy enough to pick the interest of the audience. To be honest, I really thought it can be a successor of Un-Go but what went wrong with this show? Oh well, let's proceed with the review. 
Ranpo Kitan's direction is more mysterious than the story itself because the way on how the outcome of stories were solved was bereft of any thrill and life. It was also randomly handled at times that it managed to squeeze all the characters in a single episode for God knows why. It can also be inferred that one may not enjoy fully this series if he is not familiar with Sir Edogawa's works. That alone sends a distress signal in this anime given that it cannot stand in itself. 
In addition, the audience was not given enough time and clues to solve the cases it had.  A typical Ranpo Kitan case goes as follows: Akechi and his gang do their daily hijinks, a case comes up and bam! it was solved immediately. It was as if you are listening to a narration which suddenly jumps to the resolution and bores you to death.   
The main story picks up at episode - (after some empty fillers), which is really late for an eleven episode anime and the payoff is not anything grand either. The sense of belief and tension in the finale were not there. It was as if I was just waiting to see what happens in the end.  It starts to become passable then but it was too late to redeem the audience who dropped this early on. 
Instead of focusing to create a solid plot, Ranpo Kitan focused in the quirks of the characters which was never good enough to compensate the lack of story. Twenty Faces, Shadow Man and the Medical Examiner are interesting enough since they are portrayed in a theatrical manner but without a good story to anchor them, they are just talking cardboards. 
Ranpo Kitan's characters were also not given proper development and were only shown for the sake of the writing staff to move the plot. The only standouts given these characters are Kobayashi who seems to be a sociopath and Akechi who received fair amount of development from an overpowered protagonist to someone who is likable enough in the end. 
Yet to say that Ranpo Kitan is a total waste of time is not fair. The visual techniques are really pretty that it compensates its inability to deliver a good story and I can certainly say that the background sound is one of the best I have heard this season. The opening song sets the mood for the show and the ending song is a pure earworm pop rock.  
In the end, it seems like the noitamina slot is not fail proof when it comes in producing quality shows. Ranpo Kitan is one of their casualties this season which is a shame given that this is supposed to be the tribute to Sir Edogawa's --th death anniversary.

*Minor spoilers ahead* 
A nice if uninspired update of a classic One Piece Arc. 
As most One Piece fans will attest, the Arlong/Nami back story arc was when the show first entered the world of greatness. 
I was very excited to see an update with new Animation. The original was comprised of year ---- tv animation, so while it still had a sumptuous art style its more basic animation could have really used a modern update. In addition the arc itself was not long, so a edited down definitive version was def possible. 
So was this update a success? Unfortunately not really 
First good points.  
The story retains its power, what Nami had to suffer was monstrous and to see all that suffering come to boil and then to a head with Arlong still feels transient.There is a story change that improves the story slightly, dropping the contrived method to keep Luffy incapacitated used in the show to drag out the fight a bit. The characters are the usual top notch cast you have come to expect. 
However there are some significant down sides compared to the original arc. 
While the animation is technically improved, it loses a lot of its sumptuous art style, become bland to look at. For that reason the animation is far more enjoyable in the original.  
The editing severely damages certain parts of the story. Trying to rush through and not having time to dwell on all the emotional and epic upheaval going on, it feels like watching a summary of the original arc rather then a definitive version. As soon as an important event occurs we are rushed onto the next one. 
The flaw wouldn't be so bad if not for its biggest critical flaw. The voice acting. 
In the modern day part of the story it is not as bad. While not as well acted as the original (possibly because they are rushing through it) it stands up to anime's high standard ok.  
However the voice acting in flashback parts is quite bad. The children are voiced by their adult versions putting on kid voices and their mother says her lines without much feeling. This is in contrast to the original in which they had diff actors for the kids and performed their horror and sorrow beautifully. The mother had feeling in the original and the pivotal scene was well better directed in the original. This version in essence destroys the pivotal scenes of the arc. 
Ultimately, while an enjoyable throwback to old school One Piece, this is a shadow of the real Nami arc. People new to One Piece should not watch this version they should watch the proper version in the tv show. 
Bottom line the Nami arc is one of the best One piece arcs but this version of it does NOT do it justice.

Akatsuki no Yona is probably one of the few shows I did npt expect to like that much. First, i'm not a fan of reverse harem shoujo series but this one surprised me.  
Story:  - 
Yona Of The Dawn have a really intersting story but in my opinions,we didn't see much of the conplete story in this -- episode anime. The manga is still ongoing and a lot of material for a possible second season. So, if you like historical setup with royalry and adventure, the story will take you in a wonderful ride of adventure around the kingdom to find these dragon guys. 
Art:    - 
The art and animation for this show really surprised me because I never really like Studio Pierrot animation and art style. But to be honest the animation looked really solid in yhr few action scenes and the art looked well constantly. But they also did what I really hate to see, a LOT of budget saver frames. They were there for comedic moments but they were really badly animated chibi scenes. 
Sound:   - 
I love the first opening of this show, it's one of my favourite of all time to be honest. But then came the second opening. It didn't feel right, it was way too funky and annoying that i started skipping it after - episodes. For the OST, nothing too memorable except for the opening that came back a lot as being an OST in many scenes and also changed for diferent moments. 
Characters:    - 
This is where yona of the dawn shines. The characters really is the principal focus of the show since it was only about finding the - dragons. Yona has one of the best character developpement of ----. She started from a normal innocent princess to a badass archer who would do anything to protect everyone. Hak also got good developpement but was more only there to help Yona and protect her. For the - dragons, they all got interesting backstories, reason to help her and also lovable and unique personnalities 
Enjoyement:    - 
I did enjoy Akatsuki No Yona more than I thought I would because I started watching it without expecting much and then fell in the story could not stop watching. The fight scenes, even though there were not a lot, were well made and every episode felt unique. I honestly didn't like the blue dragon arc as much as the others because it felt long and boring when it could have been faster paced. The green dragon as the best arc of this anime and the one that was the most entertaining. 
Overall:    - 
Yona Of The Dawn is a show that a lot of people, like me, missed because it was a reverse harem adventure. This show really breaks the shoujo genre by proving us that shoujos are not only for girls. The action scenes looked a lot like any other action scenes that could be in a shonen. I recommend this series to anyone interested in a thrilling adventure show and don't mind slow pace focusing on characters instead of story developpement or action.

Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart, what a series this is, it's truly something that has to be seen to believe.. And I don't mean that in a necessarily good way either. 
I'll first start off by stating I watched this expecting a whole lot of ass-kicking babes, with a lot of fan service, which is exactly what I got. But here's the kicker.. 
General premise of the series is about a girl named Aya Iseshima and her best friend Natsume Honma, and their (well Aya's anyway) inclusion in a fighting tournament called the Platonic Heart, a tournament where female fighters compete for the grand prize of the Platonic Heart, a jewel that can grant any wish to the winner of the tournament. 
Story -/-- 
I admit I was kind of enjoying this particular little anime, for a little while. 
While the story lacks any true construct, it makes up for it's brilliant fight scenes.. But then again, a story can only go so far, when after all, it is about buxom babes fighting each other with plenty of ecchi to boot. 
Art -/-- 
Now I have to say that the art style is actually pretty good. Watching our heroine beating the living daylights out of her opponents is a crisp, and rewarding thing to watch, and I love the fact the fact their clothes literally explode when a blow has been landed hehe.. Alas though, that's just about the only good thing I can say about this.. 
Sound -/-- 
The soundtrack or BGM, is rather forgettable, nothing really struck me as brilliant, I can say is that I don't particularly like the opening theme. As for the ending theme, well.. It's forgettable! (Haha, oh well, I tried) 
Character -/-- 
I really found myself liking our heroine Aya Iseshima, she has a knack for kicking some ass so.. Elegantly, which is pretty fun to watch! Aside from Aya, and her best friend, the rest of the characters hardly have any real development, they are just there for their respective episode, and we'd be lucky if we'd hear or see from them again.. Like I remember seeing one character with only - minute of screen time during the entirety of the show! She didn't have it good at all, ahh well, a lot of characters are indeed left with something to be desired, go figure. Afterall this is a show about expendable characters. 
Enjoyment -/-- 
Like I said, there are parts where I liked, but for everything I liked, there about a dozen things I didn't.. There are characters we only see for a brief period of time, sometimes see them once, and never again. Soundtrack is relatively  forgettable, and that awful opening theme I just don't care for in the slightest. Story is nothing spectacular, just your standard fighting tournament with Femme Fatale's fighting and tearing apart their clothes. 
Overall -/-- 
This is something that was truly something to behold... 
Well I guess if you're looking for a show with little plot, but plenty of fan-service action girls, then this is a show you may like, just don't go into it thinking you'll get anything other than that. Being said, the only thing I like is the main lead character Aya Iseshima (The only character with development), and her fight scenes. In conclusion, Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart is just your fan-service fix for the weekend.

Girl: Look a robot 
Girl: Oh i really wanna go into that deep hole. 
Girl: I need company. 
Girl: He can be my friend. 
The story is maleficent and flawless. When you see the Made in Abyss poster, it makes you think of an RPG game like League of Legends. 
A girl named Riko from a village goes cave raiding with her friend Nat, where she meets a robot named Reg. Then together Riko and Nat wan't to achieve something, by going into the abyss, a dangerous whole inside of the earth that has a curse and people who drop inside of the dark hole are likely to affected by this curse. The story feels exciting, and is what would make you think of disaster and suspense, especially due to young kids doing this, as grown up teenagers at age -- would find this generally easier. 
The art is what i'd call light, friendly looking and glowy. the characters has that chibi like design, especially with the large eyes separated from the mouth and rather than a fully drawn nose, they have a normal dot. People may think that prior to the design of the cute, friendly looking characters, that this show is for children, but they're wrong. The art isn't what i expected it to be at first, as to why i had to stay away from that show at first. But looking at all the normal tsundere anime girls that people find in normal shows with a normal, straight forward character design, i just got fed up with them and so i wanted to get away from them and take a look at this show. 
The sound is very amazing and the OST is underrated, the music is just great. The OP is what makes you think of adventure, and the ending song is like a relief to such a disturbing show, which is why it's great. Even though some songs at the beginning are composed by Australians (Has an English voice), it's an enjoyable, catchy tune to rise up your mood. Now don't be such a weeaboo and say, ""Y U NO HAVE JAPANESE VOICE THIS SHOW IZ SHIT"". The acting is well presented, and since i'm going off topic about the voice actors in the show and focusing on the OST music, i should say the cast is very talented and the voices are accurate, they had put a lot of work into getting talented casts. 
The characters are so lovable and memorable, don't think there is gonna be attractive, tsundere characters however. The characters have different personalities. Riko is an optimistic girl with a bright personality upon meeting Reg. Nat is a well organised boy who is strict and careful over Riko, despite being against her plan, and saying some harmful things to Riko as well (Says her mum died in episode -, making her cry). Nat is a caring boy who just wants to make sure everyone is safe. Reg is a boy in the shape of a robot who just wants to make Riko feel safe. Ouzen is an old lady with a cold personality, but she's only harsh cause she wants them to succeed their adventure into the abyss. As she did with Riko's mother Lyza, she treated her the same way she treated Riko and Reg, at one point, Ouzen was gonna destroy Reg, as she slammed him many times to the ground, but seeing he won't break, she thought he was worth. Therefore Ouzen gave the two main characters a chance. Lastly Nanachi, is a ""final form"", she along with her friend Mitty, had their appearance changed forever as a result of an experiment that had to do with one of the layers in the abyss. (Mitty looked like a monster and Nanachi looked like a rabbit).    
Even though that had happened, Nanachi still has a cool and normal personality, even when she had Reg kill Mitty whilst Riko was being treated after bleeding away in episode --. They still have cool and peaceful personalities. 
I really enjoyed watching this anime. There is a lot of backstory and drama, plus thrilling, breath taking scenes. You may think this anime was made for kids, but this is a disturbing, dark anime that is more intense and is probably more twisted than Madoka Magica. Made in Abyss premium anime you are not able to view on Crunchyroll. That is said, can be viewed on Prime Video or HIDIVE outside North America. 
Overall - --, i recommend this anime to many viewers who's a fan of the best anime, e.g Hunter x Hunter, One Piece etc.

In this case, we have characters based on the Zodiac in a battle royale, it is not the most unique way of telling things, but it's nice if you can find a few characters you like.  There's a lot of backstories, even the first episode is mostly just world building and backstory. 
Honestly, the only reason I'm writing this, is because someone had to tell me this exists.  For those that call this story predictable... it is.  Because it's the retelling of something.  In the --th episode, one character makes a reference to a specific something.  I cannot give spoilers here, but if you pm me I can explain if you would like.  The reference, is what Juuni Taisen is a retelling of, just in a different setting. 
My only real problem, is I told myself midway if I did not like the winner, I would not like the show.  Not because of wah I want X to win, but whether I just like the winner's personality, and no, the character was boring.  While I liked a few other contestants, he and the --th episode just leave a sour taste of finishing the story.  I hope I've made sense.

Somewhere in another world the Demon King is about to become ruler of the entire world, but he is stopped by the hero and is forced to live in Japan. Start comedy of the Spring ---- season. 
This shows main draw is the characters. Just about all of them are exceptionally entertaining, even the ones that tend me be kind of annoying have some truly hilarious moments, especially when you add in their facial expressions. 
Many watchers will be pleased by the fact that they show never really goes into full out harem. Although each girl has some level of feelings for the MC, they vary based on their background with him. 
I mean obviously the show is a social dialogue on the state of the economy where the great demon king Satan (Sadao) has to work at a McRonalds in order to scrap together rent. Well, maybe that's stretching it a bit. But part of what makes the show great is the setting that it's put in. 
The early episodes are clearly better than the ones in the middle. This is kind of problematic because there is a slight decline in quality throughout the series until you get to the ending (which are really good episodes). The comedy is still there and it's still very entertaining, but the funniest character is essentially sidelined. This is not to say the episodes are not bad, they are actually pretty good, but it's like the difference from an A to a B. 
The animation is well done and on closer examination looks kind of like a more polished Katanagatari based on how the colors are done and such. 
If you want a unique comedy with entertaining characters look no further than this show. It's one of the best that Spring ---- had to offer.

For context, I wanted to love this show. Genuinely, Love Live! School Idol Project! is my favourite anime. It is so far the only anime which has made me cry... multiple times. I was hoping for the same sort of experience with Sunshine, and I kid you not, actually abandoned the show halfway trough the first episode. I was already losing faith in the show at this point, but Mari’s first line was in such broken Japanese that I couldn’t bear it. It took me a few weeks to decide to give Sunshine another watch, only to again drop the show due to Mari, specifically the infamous “It’s joke” scene. She defies explainantion! Her English is horrible and her Japanese isn’t that much better, bringing in the question as to how she communicates with other people. I finally rejoined the show again and made it through episode -- when I realised I would never like the show and abandoned it. 
It’s taken me quite a while, but I realised why I instantly connected with Honoka in School Idol Project. After a pretty catchy prelude, episode - of School Idol Project literally begins with ‘Hi, I’m Honoka, oh no my school is going to be shut down, I have to do something!!!’ Her goal wasn’t fame or notability, it was to save the school that was so deeply engrained in her family. Not to mention that Honoka fails. She works her butt off to make Muse’s first little concert happen and nobody showed up to it except for core characters, which acted as the catalyst for their inevitable union. 
Contrast this with Sunshine’s opening. Chika is immediately met with the world of school idols and is entranced by it. She wants the fame, but doesn’t understand what actually drove Muse. Aqours’ first concert was also a raging success, which kind of took away from Dia’s words. When Eli criticised Honoka in SIP, it’s powerful because despite the horrible failure she just endured, Honoka proves she is not willing to give up. Dia criticises Chika in a very similar way, but the scene loses its significance when the crowd is packed. 
Another thing that greatly put me off Sunshine was the characters. If I’m honest, I could probably write down the character traits of Muse members on strips of paper, shuffle a few around a tiny bit, and end up with pretty accurate descriptions of Aqours members. Unfortunately, Sunshine also added extra character traits that just make the characters downright annoying. While I certainly liked some characters in School Idol Project better than others, I never once hated any of the characters. With Sunshine, I only liked - characters; Ruby because I like cuteness, and You because she really is a jack of all trades. However, I also have hatred towards - of the main characters; Mari and Yoshiko. Mari steals the ‘rich girl’ title from Maki, the desire to grope the other girls from Nozomi, and has the worst voice of all of Aqours. It is almost exactly like nails on a chalkboard, complete with sharp screeches. Yoshiko, on the other hand, suffers from chronic chuunibyou (- grade syndrome) which leaves her believing she is a “fallen angel” named Yohane. In all honesty, I like chuunibyou as a concept and I actually fell victim to it when I was, fittingly, in -th grade. Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions pulled the idea off incredibly. Yoshiko is just out of place and much more annoying to the point where I can’t stand her. The other characters are decent, but they none of the Aqours members hold a flame to Muse’s members. 
With the gorgeous animation and interesting small town setting, I’m disappointed that I could never get into Sunshine. I wanted more of the emotions that School Idol Project gave me and held Sunshine to that standard. In fact, I likely would have enjoyed this show if the writers never called back to Muse. If they separated the two, I would have as well. It’s because of all of the callbacks to Muse that I find myself comparing these two shows; one that repeatedly caused me to cry and another that was just too similar.

This is probably the worst shounen I've ever seen. 
Story: -/--. 
Art: -/--. Easily the worst animated shounen I've seen.  
Sound: -/--. Nothing of note here. Since the series itself is like ---- episodes long you can probably find some good openings or endings though. I do remember Ending - making me want to rip my ears off, it is abhorrent. 
Character: -/--. Sasuke and Naruto are basically the dumbed-down version of Griffith and Guts. They have no chemistry, and their 'friendship' consists of Sasuke getting all the girls to look at him and Naruto expressing his envy every five seconds. Sakura is just a third-wheeler who gets in the way and, oh boy, is she annoying af. 
The only good characters are probably Rock Lee, Orochimaru and Kakashi. Rock Lee actually puts in hard work and strives to be the best; he doesn't have asspull demon powers to guide him through everything, and he's just a likable guy. Orochimaru is actually intimidating and has an ounce of intrigue to his character. And Kakashi, well, there's not much to hate about him. He has a cool design and is pretty chill. 
Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically what you get when a -- year old writes a -deep-u shounen. Edgy dudes like Gaara and Sasuke make me hate rival tropes in shounen. 
Enjoyment: -/--. Do you want to go through endless filler, flashbacks and slow paced episodes with horrible artwork? Me neither. 
Overall: -/--. I'd rather watch Fairy Tail, and I despise Fairy Tail.

When I first saw Hitoribocchi in the seasonal list I was excited. Being a big fan of CGDCT, and very much enjoying those CGDCT that focus on real, relatable problems, I was excited to see what Hitoribocchi had to offer. While the issue of low self-esteem and social anxiety is not new to CGDCT, I personally like to see what each take on it is, and to gleem whatever there can be from the situations that the characters get into. There is a lot of potential in the idea, as the wholesome friendly tone of CGDCT allow for these more serious topics to be covered without going too far down into the negativity spiral, and rather give hope, and show how one can be helped. Sadly, Hitoribocchi did not live up to this, and rather than use those factors to it's benefit, it ended up using them to its determent. 
Most CGDCT shows are to an extent a comedy. While iyashikei CGDCT aren't so much, the general bread and butter CGDCT usually will have some level of comedy in them. And while some will pare down the comedy to focus on other aspects, others decide to go full into the comedy and let it be the main focus along with the cute girls themselves. For Hitoribocchi most of the focus is placed on the comedy. Most of the scenes are comedic scenes in nature and are designed to make the audience laugh. However this did not work as well for me due to the issues that lay in Hitoribocchi's premise, and their game plan. 
While I was hoping to be able to relate to Hitori and feel for her situation, the show's focus on comedy nipped that hope in the bud. Rather than get a character who felt down to earth, even if moeified, Hitori feels like a personification of r-k or r/meirl. She acts like a meme in the idea that she can't do literally anything without tripping over herself. And while to an extent that is understandable, the things that she does to avoid these situations that she doesn't want to be in are so comedically stupid that it's very hard to take her seriously. Her whole character is so overdone that it ends up being frustrating rather than enderaing. It feels not only played up for laughs, but existing purely for laughs. And while shows like Comic Girls can also play up the main character's issues for laughs, they make sure to put lots of care into her issues and don't have them exist just for jokes. This happens with more than just the main character too. While the show does try for more heartfelt moments with some of them, many of them are very gimmicky, and feel out of range when they try to hit more emotional moments despite most of their character being designed for comedy. Overall it feels like its trying to hit both the more emotional elements while also being a complete comedy but ultimately the two work against each other rather than with each other. 
Furthermore the background of the show also messes with the general wholesomeness that I usually find in CGDCT. Even in the most comedic CGDCT there is a fiorm friendship that exists between the cast, one that hammers home the friendliness and fun that exists all throughout. And while Hitoribocchi has its moments that show this, it also has other moments where that feels completely absent. The biggest issue leading to this is the set up. Hitori starts making friends in order to live up to a promise she had with an old firend of hers to make friends with everyone in the class. In many cases there is less care put into the friend that Hitori is making and only into having a friend in name. And while I do believe the friendships do grow with time, there are certainly moments that just aren't enjoyable when it feels like the friendship that is there is a shallow vechine for Hitori to live up to her promise.  Add to this the constant tired jokes that cylce throughout the show, and the friendship ends up feeling like an afterthought. 
All things said I do think Hitoribocchi has it's moments. And there are characters in it that are cute and likeable. But frankly I don't like the comedy style at all, and the show is so heavily focused on comedy despite its premise. And while there are moments where it tries to live up to its premise, ultimately the show's focus on comedy hinders those moments and the overall fun feeling of the show. If you like the style of comedy bertter than I do then it's likely that you'll enjoy it more than I did. But I feel like if you're coming in here after reading the premise and hoping for a nice blend between social anxiety and cute fun, then you're likely in the wrong place. Personally even for comedy I feel like there are better comedic CGDCT that have more fun premise and that use it better. Ultimately I don't think the show is very good, and fails at the different types of CGDCT it tries to be.

Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a fantastic story about a young princess named Nausicaa as she battles deadly plants, animals, insects, and humans to rescue the Valley of the Wind and the world.  It has nonstop action for almost - hours that’ll keep you wondering what will come next, because you won’t, and it makes this movie a lot of fun from start to finish.  It’s definitely worth watching if you enjoy anime movies at all.   
The filmaker is Hiyao Miyazaki, a world famous artist that has produced megahits such as Lupin III, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and most recently Ponyo, just to name a few.  Most everything he’s done has been extremely successful; Nausicaa was one of his first classics as it was made in ----.   
The Story takes place in a bleak future where people are losing their control of the world to poison plants and giant insects.  At no time does it lose you as the action carries the movie but within all the chaos is an epic about man’s harm it could do to the earth.  Like most Miyazaki films it has a all themes tied in some way to nature.  All that being said it is one of the strongest points of the movie.   
The Sound in the movie is split in two parts (I watched the newest english dub):  Amazing dialogue and voice acting versus terrible music.  The voice acting cast is awesome with some of the best in the business lending their voices such as Patrick Stewart (who did a great job in Elder Scrolls IV), Uma Thurman, Shia Lebeouf, and Mark Hamill (who made one of the classic Simpsons appearances).  Not only does it have the star studded cast but all of them deliver.  The other actors rise to the level of their counterparts too, giving wonderful performances across the board.  I can’t think of one character who I didn’t end up believing was genuine.  In my opinion this is the best aspect of the movie.  The sound effects are effective…(sorry).  Nothing seems out of place or makes a sound different than what you’d expect.  The music on the other hand feels very dated.  The lackluster --’s beats feel forced onto the movie and never impact it much at all.  This is the biggest drawback of the movie as the score carries zero impact.  Action music doesn’t get your heart racing at all and the mood setters just make you wonder when the silly music will pass.  Thankfully this part of a movie can be easily overcome if the rest rocks.  This one does. 
The characters aren’t all that memorable but they do what they’re supposed to.  The majestic princess, the powermonger, the great old warrior; many common stereotypes of anime characters appear with Nausicaa in my opinion standing out the most.  Helped by a great job of voice acting, she is fearless and leads for the entire film, even when challenged by others.  Her will is displayed greatly and makes you want to root for her to succeed.  The animal and plant drawings are really imaginative but at some points that can be a drawback as some things look, in my own opinion, utterly ridiculous.  Not all are bad though, as many things look like they could be on our planet at some point.  More reasons to watch and judge for yourself though. 
To sum up this anime has it all except for the scant but bad music.  It even has gunships shaped like actual guns!  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime movies as you may find this among your favorites, especially if your the environmentalist type..

I will be honest, I don't like that there's are black characters that are central to the story, yet are voiced by Japanese people.  There was one joke, in particular, that was really obnoxious, more towards the beginning.  That being said, I think a lot of people make excuses for it without addressing the main question: Is there really a need to bring up race like this if he doesn't really struggle or overcome many racial tensions in Japan?   
The issue in doing an anime about a team of people, especially in a series that only has -- episodes to do it, is that you have to flesh out every character.  Unfortunately, there just isn't enough given to Musa for them to justify having a black character.  Maybe one or two comments are thrown at him, and this pureness of his character handles the initial reaction, but he's already done running and quite honestly they didn't make any progressive comments on race in Japan at all.  That's not what this anime was about, and really it just feels slightly more offensive than it should.  Not that I was expecting a Japanese company about Japanese college students to really handle any racial tension with any sort of grace, I can't say that I will let this anime really pass on a great score. 
That being said, I think that overall they did try to make a good series and I have enjoyed watching it.  It gave me something to do, and I wasn't turned off from the first few episodes with a promise of something better.  And I won't lie, I did tear up at a few of the bigger moments towards the end.  I like seeing the more central characters grow, but I think that just maybe because I'm in college myself and I can relate to a lot of these characters.  There's potential with exploring this idea that I would love to see more, and hopefully, there's a much larger step towards creating a more progressive storyline that I think anime severely lacks. 
If you don't like sporty anime about groups of men doing things with the token girl character that stands as a goal of desire rather than be of much substance, then this might not be for you.  I regretfully can look past most of these underlying themes to still get a lot out of the more sentimental moments, but what does that really say about me?

Review of Charlotte! 
Plot: -/-- 
Charlotte offers a slightly atypical look at the common superpower and high school combination genre of anime. Instead of focusing on how these superpowers are harnessed or other common themes, it instead focuses more on the people themselves and how the superpowers afflict multiple aspects of their lives. The plot, however, suffers from poor pacing and disjointed development, all of which can be summed up as convenient. The story moves fairly well for the first couple episodes, but starts getting off mid-series. A major plot point is undone at this point, which just ruins the plot for the rest of show. The ending is rushed at best and leaves the viewer with minimal satisfaction, even if all loose ends were tied up. Several plot points are also inconsistent throughout the series, such as the power supposedly being all imperfect but these imperfections only seem to inflict main characters and even then this ends up not being the truth,  and things of significance are glanced over, with incomplete or unsatisfying answers to the anime’s biggest questions. 
Characters: -/-- 
The characters of Charlotte were generally well developed, with their relationships, past, and feelings being covered extensively. They were all also generally likable, and easy enough to relate to. However, unless you got attached to Yu the most, a lot of the characters end up feeling tossed by the wayside, as they were merely filler or had served their purpose and were no longer needed. This to me was extremely frustrating, as the viewer is almost tricked in a way into thinking characters in the beginning  with so much build up will have a dominant presence until the end, but this is not so. The main character Yu is also overpowered in a way, but going into that would cause major spoilers. The undoing of one of the plot points also ruins a lot of development, as it is essentially erased. This leaves some later character interactions feeling forced or artificial, stealing emotion from what are suppose to be tender moments. 
Animation: --/--  
As to be expected from Key, the animation in Charlotte is absolutely stunning. With well done character designs and beautiful backdrops, the series definitely keeps things afloat with the gorgeous artwork. 
Soundtrack: --/-- 
Similar to animation, the soundtrack is well done. It helps make up for some of the lost tense or tenderness, due to flaws in plot or characters, in some scenes. The soundtrack makes an excellent effort, and it definitely pays off. 
Themes: -/-- 
Salvation and redemption are two of the most major themes within Charlotte, and both manifest themselves through Yu. The beginning of the series shows that redemption is being sought from the powers by some people, but this becomes more explicit how much of a burden the powers are. The redemption is not just from the powers, but also from emotional turmoil, which happens at a couple points in the series in a variety of ways. Yu is the primary receiver of the emotional redemption. Salvation also comes due to Yu, who saves a lot of power users, though other character offer a role as savior, though more subtly, such as Nao and Shun. Other good themes are present, such as family relations and dealing with a burden. However, the show loses the impact of these themes to a high degree through primarily the plot reversal and the rushed ending, and this is another momentum killer for the anime. 
Final Score: --/--

For some time now, I have maintained a strict no-dropping stuff policy and an always follow recommendations one, and I had never regretted that decision. Unfortunately, Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. made me hate myself for holding that ideal. 
Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. (I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.) is an anime produced by Asread and directed by Kinji Yoshimoto (Genshiken -, Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai). It is the adaptation of the light novel series of the same name. 
While the premise may give hints of originality, the rest of the story does not present any whatsoever. Presenting almost no real story, the story focus on the day-to-day lives on the workers of the shop, which could have made an enjoyable slice-of-life, however, their lives fail to be compelling or even entertaining to watch, choosing to focus on ecchi.  
Don't get me wrong, I have no problems with ecchi if it doesn't become the main focus of a story. Hell, I enjoyed No Game No Life, and it was full of fanservice. Sadly, Yuushibu's is nothing more than a road between boob grabs and panty shots. 
Towards the end of the season, Yuushibu tried hard to create a more dramatic and even political plot , but couldn't manage to do so. It tried to make an internal conflict for Fino (the Demon Lord's daughter), but its effort only resulted in laughably predictable storyline that, as always, resulted in breasts being exposed. 
Incredibly, Fino was the most interesting character of the cast, with her quirky personality and lack of knowledge of the human world, even with her proness to nudity. The rest of the cast is hugely forgettable. Raul was a blank slate, with no real motivation for his desires. The other workers, all girls, with the exception of one guy, were only there for more panty shots and plot  
Said all that, it made a genuine effort to create an interesting world. Actually, it was the aspect of the anime I enjoyed the most (that is to say, the only aspect I enjoyed). It was lovely seeing how magic was integrated with day-to-day life.  
The comedy was unoriginal and missed the timing, most of the time. I can't remember laughing during any of the -- episodes. It all felt too forced, with situations being created only to spawn jokes in a ridiculously obvious way. 
The art was pretty looking, but, looking at it with more care, it failed  to create its own style, particularly with the character design, which looked like rehashes of stuff that we see numerous times through the years. The animation of the few battle scenes was quite smooth, specially considering Yuushibu is, for the most part, a slice-of-life. 
Much like the visuals, the soundtrack was decent, but not above-average in any way. The same can be said about the voice acting. 
I, personally, hated almost every second of it. I am normally an easy laugher, but I didn't find any of the comedy even remotely funny; the story was uninteresting; the character development was basically non-existent, and I was not into the fanservice. 
I watchedYuushibu only because someone recommended it to me as a great slice-of-life with just one tiny bit of fanservice. I can't remember who did it, but I am never trusting that person again if I find him/her. 
I would recommend it only for people looking for boobs and panties, as they will find a lot to enjoy. But I can't really recommend it to anyone else. 
Feel free to leave your (constructive) criticsm in my profile!

Many people tend to compare Code Geass to Death Note, while they do have things in common, Code Geass is no match for Death Note. This review only contains first season, because after finishing the first season I have no desire whatsoever to continue second season. I will explain why Code Geass is no masterpiece and at most a decent anime so bear with me before clicking that not helpful botton.  
Story: - 
Code Geass is essentially about a high school student Lelouch who was given a power named Geass to control other people by looking through their eyes. Lelouch is heir to Britanian Empire, but after his mother was killed and his father show no emotion for his mother's death, he relinquished his rights and was expelled to Japan, a nation colonised by the Empire. Lelouch, with his Geass power, now tries to overthrow the Empire and revenge his mother's death. The reason why Story of Code Geass is only worth a - is because also many said it has a lot of plot twists and colliding ideology, etc, etc. By further looking into the story, the plot is actually very simple and cliche. The main storyline is about Lelouch and his childhood friend susake's colliding ideology. So to put it in a simple way, Lelouch seeks peace through violence and power, by destroying his opponents at all costs and Suzaku seeks peace by ""trying to gain a position within the empire and avoid violence"". How is that even ""complex""? You could easily see that sort of ideology collision in Deathnote, light Vs L, Akame ga kill, night raid vs Ran, naruto, pain vs naruto, attack on titan, Eren vs armin. Though they differ a little in different animes, it is basically the same approach where one supports violence and the other takes a softer approach. It is amusing how anyone could say that it is ""unique"" and ""complex"". Code Geass also has a lot of plotholes, one thing I dislike the most is that the mecha element in this show is completely a mess. There is no explanation given to the standards involved in these fights, we don't know how these mechas function, their weaknesses or their relative strength. There is a mech called lancelot, appeared to be one of the toughest mech out there, but even then we don't know how strong it is quantitatively, what I mean is that in these battles, what we can see is lancelot destroying one mech after another in early episode and then another mech is introduced driven by kellan and after that another bad-ass mech driven by C.C and lelouch. What I see is that the show throws powerful mechs at you without explaining anything about them. This makes fights in Code Geass lackluster because all fights at the end resorts to the fact that which side has the most bad-ass mech, this fact completely defeats the ""tactic"" element in Code Geass. Apart from that, the Geass ability is very inconsistent through the show, there are no rules for this ability like there are ten rules for death note. Another problem with Code Geass is a common problem in most shows: it trivalise the idea of ""rebellion"" or ""revolution"". Same in Akame ga kill, rebellion is depicted as something only about power fights, little was mentioned about politics, economics and other key elements. I know you can't demand an anime to consider all that, but i am not contented with the way Code Geass deals with the idea of ""rebellion"". There are many other problems  that I will not mention here due to word counts, but all other problems are not minor. 
Art: - 
Art is consistent through out, although i am no fan of this type of animation, It is generally good. 
Character: - 
Now this is the worst part of Code Geass, many other people say that characters in this show are complex and different. Yes they are different and varies a lot, but they are no way near complex, some of the characters are completely ridiculous and irrational.  
Let's begin with suzaku. Image your country is colonised by another country, and there is a guy from your country who joined the invading country and fights your own people. This guy is what suzaku is. He tried to change the status quo by securing a position in Empire at the same time fighting lelouch multiple times where he literally destroyed many chances of Japan being independent. But for now let's assume he is really that stupid and believe in whatever he believes. now look that what he is doing, did he try to secure a position in politics and try to persuade royal members? did he make propaganda about equality and peace? NO and NO, he sits in his lancelot and fights his own people, this is how this guy wants to change the empire from within. Now at this point I can still bear with this incredibly irrational character, but not until the point he faced zero and when empire fired missles at them he refused to escape even though it means dying with zero. Now What the heck is with this scene? Let us be clear that suzaku tries to change the empire from within, now how are you going to do that if you are dead? I am curious. After watching that episode, suzaku in my opinion changes from an irrational character to a complete joke.  
Now let's talk about lelouch, he is not bad character but is very inconsistent, as smart as he is, he doesn't know if someone's following him, becomes easily emotional in battles, accidentally caused a massacre( yes you heard me right, the biggest plot twist is accidentally caused, this literally means the following plots and what lelouch does after that is not what he planned for ). As a main character with so many sentiments, his background is as plain as it could be: ""my mother is killed so sad I need to revenge for her"".  
Other side characters are either occupy little screen or are irrational in different degrees.  
enjoyment: - 
I did enjoy the show, that is what make me finish the first season, otherwise I would have dropped it mid way. However, once I finished it and think about the show backwards, it is a joke to me, what Code Geass is is an anime that takes many popular elements of the decades and mix them together in a very bad way and produced a half-decent hybrid that has so many plot holes and irrational characters. Yet many people think this is a masterpiece. But no , trust me, if you really think deep about suzaku and lelouch's motivation and their doings, you would realize just how ridiculous they are.  
Overall: 
No masterpiece, only a decent overrated anime.

By some twist of fate you have stumbled across this old and obscure anime called Dragon Fist that less than --- people scored on MAL. You are now perhaps wondering if you should watch this OVA or not. Do not worry; I'm here to save your time by telling you not to watch it. Seriously don't, unless you really want to see a truly bad anime. I have watched a lot of anime before this and Dragon Fist is still one of the worst I have seen. Let me explain why.  
First off I should clarify that Dragon Fist is an OVA, which is important because OVA's generally imply higher budget and higher budget implies better animation/art than a regular anime series, but unfortunately that is not the case with Dragon Fist. This anime simply looks inferior, it does not even have a --’s series level of quality, much less of a --’s OVA level of quality. Dragon Fist noticeably uses a lot of budget saving measures such as still frames and only showing the backs of the characters when they are talking. The latter half of the OVA also has lots of fuck ups, especially in the facial department; you will know what I'm talking about if you watch it. The Artstyle of the anime itself is pretty much generic --'s shounen art, think Yu Yu Hakusho and the like. If you want to watch some neat --’s high quality OVA action anime, then you are in the wrong place. 
Second important thing that I must mention is the fact this anime is an adaptation of a manga by the same name, and while I have not read the original manga (it isn't even translated) it really shows that it is an adaptation. Why you ask? Because the story does not make sense, the characters do not make sense, and because the plot is all over the place and is extremely rushed in terms of pacing. I could easily see a less experienced anime watcher being confused by what is going on in this anime, so I will briefly summarize the story to help those confused viewers.  
The Synopsis of this anime is deceptive since it talks about dragons and the protagonist being a kind of half dragon half human, so viewers would naturally think this is a fantasy anime, right? They would be wrong, because this OVA is actually about cloning and has nothing to do with dragons and fantasy, other than the protagonist being one. So the basic setup is already a mess given that it is some weird mix of fantasy and SCI-FI without any natural cohesion, but it gets only worse.  We have - named characters in this anime, they are as follows: Fei-Long Ling - The Dragon Boy, Katano Fuyuka - Female lead and Clone, Kaga Naoki - Another Clone, and finally Sugiura - the Villain. All of them are students at the same school; Naoki and Sugiura are the masterminds behind the cloning. And that is really all there is to their characters.  
We start with some expositional narrating about the Dragon Clan that lasts for a few minutes, there is really no point to it given the fact that the anime does not deal with the dragons at all, so it counts as wasted screen time in my book. After that we are immediately thrown into a Japanese high-school (because of course), where our Chinese dragon protagonist is being bullied by his Japanese classmates. Why is he being bullied? Who knows. It never comes up again in the OVA, so it is simply inserted there to evoke some kind of pity for the protagonist, but it fails to even do that because it comes out of nowhere and ends abruptly, like every other plot point in this anime.  
After the bullying scene we are greeted with a rooftop scene where our dragon protagonist decided to angst and be a loner, coincidentally this causes him to witness - nameless goons trying to kidnap Katano Fuyuka, the clone girl. He being the hero of the story obviously threatens the goons to stop, who despite outnumbering Ling; decide to leave with a classic ""I'll not forget this.""  This event obviously causes our male protagonist and our female lead to be introduced to each other. Fuyuka immediately reveals to Ling that she is a clone and that she escaped from a facility (and for some reason escaped into a school), Ling does not really react or give a fuck about this revelation, he just takes it naturally, because this is the character quality in this anime. Anyway Ling promises to Fuyuka that he will protect her no matter what, despite only knowing her for about - minutes.  
Hilariously - second after making that proclamation, Ling leaves Fuyuka alone, who is immediately ambushed by Naoki first and then by the - same goons from before. This was so hilarious that I couldn't help but laugh. This anime kind of functions as an unintentional comedy given how terribly constructed it is. Anyway the - goons kidnap Fuyuka and bring her back to the cloning facility; Ling who was doing god knows what notices the absence of Fuyuka and heads after her. This is where I'll stop summarizing the story and start talking about the important matters. 
This is easily one of the most rushed anime I have seen, it goes through what seems to be like a few episodes worth of anime material in the span of -- minutes, which goes horribly with the fact that the anime tries to be very melodramatic in its drama. For example Fuyuka goes from wanting to live to wanting to die in - minutes then wanting to live again in another - minutes, because reasons. The characters also pretend to have known each other for a longer period of time, despite having only met each other for a day. Fuyuka for example admires Ling and has feelings for him despite only meeting him that day and speaking with him for less than - minutes. Naoki and Sugiura also know of Ling despite never meeting him before, because properly introducing the villains to the protagonist is for good anime only. Dragon Fist is also full of ""dramatic revelations"" that come out of nowhere, except they don't have any dramatic effects because of how incredibly rushed everything is.  
Ling despite being a powerful dragon is somehow able to be pushed around and almost beaten by the - nameless human goons, until of course he decides to transform in traditional shounen fashion into his dragon form and beat everyone. Naoki only exists as a plot device character who can stall for time by sacrificing his own life, so that Ling can rescue Fuyuka from the villain, which also makes little sense seeing Ling in his dragon form was super fast yet it still took him minutes to catch up to Fuyuka and Sugiura.  
While we are on the note of Sugiura, let's talk about him and his motivations as a villain. Like everything else in this OVA, he too makes zero sense. It is revealed that the reason Sugiura conducted the cloning experiment was so he could clone his mother who was suffering from heart problems. Both Naoki and Fuyuka were successful clones albeit with defects, Fuyuka escapes the facility and he wastes time trying to recapture her, even though he has no reason to do so. Once he has captured her, Sugiura tortures Fuyuka by revealing the fact that her lifespan is limited, even though he has no reason to torture her. Then when Ling rescues Fuyuka, Sugiura heads after them in order to kill Fuyuka, even though he has no reason to do so, because Fuyuka will die in a couple more minutes even if he doesn't do anything. As a whole the villain makes zero sense, he just wants to kill the other - characters because he is retarded.  
The music for Dragon Fist was made by Kenji Kawai, who is one of my favourite Japanese composers, his instrumental performance in Dragon Fist is pretty solid and arguably the only decent aspect of the anime, but I must unfortunately mention the fact that is only true for the instrumental music in this anime. Dragon Fist plays - really awkward vocal songs during its run time and they simply feel awkward because they do not fit into their respective scenes and come out of nowhere, further ruining the already messed up tone of the anime.  
Who would I recommend this OVA to? Nobody.  
As I said the only reason to watch this mess is if you want to see some truly bad anime or if you want to treat it as an unintentional comedy.

""Everybody Hates Naofumi"" is your obligatory seasonal Isekai that went viral just like its predecessors because it tried to bring something else to the table. This time, its not about time travel but the victimization of our protagonist in the most exaggerated (and almost comical) way imaginable. But before we get to the ""twist"" that made this show unlike any other Isekai you've seen, let's take a moment to talk about the elephant in the room: the protagonist everybody hates in the story, including me.  
Naofumi, your ordinary Otaku, gets summoned to a fantasy world against his will. Instead of actually voicing his opinion on the matter, he accepts it instead, unlike the - other heroes who immediately frowned after being teleported, or should I say ""abducted"" at this point. At first, Naofumi seems your typical self-insert protagonist who gets all the waifus and lolis while treating them as they were mere ""prizes"" he can collect and show off to the viewer, without actually making any move. But then we get to the ""twist"", which this time is a false rape accusation that was randomly thrown away without any actual context or motive. Apparently, almost all the characters in this show victimize the protagonist and treat him like garbage because of rumors about the ""Shield Hero"" being a horrible person. Then why exactly did you summon him in the first place? Why not execute him after falsely accusing him without any evidence whatsoever?  
Needless to say, Naofumi, who was first presented as an atypical protagonist who doesn't do any of the cliches mentioned previously, becomes your typical protagonist who does ALL of the cliches mentioned previously in just - episodes. But this time everything is excused, since he was victimized and everybody who doesn't side with him is immediately labelled as villain. No matter what he says or does, it makes sense to the viewer who immediately sides with him without actually taking his actions and decisions into consideration. 
Some of his decisions are questionable as they raise some serious ethical questions, like his idea of buying a loli slave. Why exactly does it have to be a loli? Couldn't be something less pathetic and more adequate for a fantasy world, like an animal companion? Later on, he decides to buy an actual animal as means for transportation. But that exact animal turns into a loli too for no other reason than to pander people's fetishes. There is nothing wrong with having a harem, loli or any other type of fanservice element as long as its relevant to the genre. When I decide to watch a fantasy anime, I'm not exactly expecting constant arguing between the waifus over the protagonist. I'm also not expecting random lolis who add nothing to its story and development. In fact, the only reason why I decided to watch this show in the first place was because everybody was saying how different and refreshing it is. Is it? 
As the story progresses, Naofumi begins to feel like any other overpowered, know-it-all protagonist since he never looses, even when the enemy is clearly cheating or way beyond his level. Not to mention the fact that he was presented, from the very first beginning, as the weakest among the heroes since he can only use a shield. Apparently, this shield turns out to be a devastating plot device he can use to heal, damage, trap or block enemies.  
Everything and everyone is in Naofumi's favor, since he is the victim in the story for poorly explained reasons. I'm guessing it has something to do with a devilish curse, but it all feels too contrived. From the false accusation to the slave loli to the typical harem.  
You might as well call him ""Kirito, but this time its more tragic"".  
The pacing is absurdly fast sometimes, like when Raphtalia turns from a weak, shy and sensitive loli to a tsundure, jealous and badass ---year old girl in just one episode or when Filo rapidly grows up in just one day. And all of this fast progression is shown using a slideshow of images, which honestly felt more like a PowerPoint presentation to me. Really? That's not character development. Its more of a skipping in order to rush Naofumi's harem. 
Other times, the pacing is purposefully dragged out for the sake of fillers. You have a fight between Naofumi and another Hero over who gets to keep the loli, and it is used to victimize Naofumi even further by making EVERY single character in the episode hate him. You have a risky pointless adventure where they go looking for magical crystals just to make a special dress for Filo (She constantly transforms into a loli, remember?).  
World building is almost non existent. Everything is presented as a video game even thought it isn't (the protagonist gets summoned after opening a book that describes the fantasy world he's trapped in, and not after playing a video game or something). The protagonist even has an interactive UI at his disposal he can use to upgrade his weapons or view his stats. So it actually is an alternate reality video game after all. Moreover, the world is a copy-paste of what you'd expect to find in any Isekai anime. If I took a random screenshot of this fantasy world and showed it to people next year, they wouldn't be able to tell which Isekai anime it is. In fact, they will probably think its next year's Isekai anime. That's how dull, unimpressive and repetitive the world seems to me.  
""Everybody Hates Naofumi"" is no different from any other Isekai you've seen for the last - years. The only reason you feel like its different and refreshing is because the writer tries his best to convince you that it is, while pouring the exact same elements scavenged from different Isekais over the years into the mixer and calling it a day. He's the perfect example of a seller convincing you to buy a product you already have and seen (OP protagonist and his harem) by telling you its different (victimizing the protagonist for the sake of plot armoring everything and everyone around him). But this victimization which was too exaggerated to the point that it became irritating is more than enough to fool the average viewer into thinking this time its different. 
It's not.

Welcome to the NHK is in my opinion one of the best black comedies of all the time and here my reasons. 
Story 
This show is more than ""the story of a archetipical hikikomoro"" In a few words this show is a realistic representation of some common subcultures (if we can call it like that) in Japan, otaku, neet (people without employment) and hikikomori (people who are afraid to get outside his ""safe space"", mostly his house or his room. This makes the story touch some common psychological and social issues like depression, escapism, etc. in a very mature and serious way with comedy and some social commentary but not in a so direct way. 
Character 
The strongest point of the series, his characters are way more than the archetypes of this subcultures (hikikomori, otaku as examples). The story represent this characters in a very human way, they aren't just stereotypes you can laugh to, they are represented as real people with real life problems many of us had, the fear of failure, the pressure of dealing with the family, the lost of someone we love and the feeling of being useless in society. Each character's deal with different but similar problems, explain the characters and all their dimensions is so difficult so it can be write in this review, so this explanation above is better than categorizing them in stereotypes like "" otaku"". 
Art 
The designs are simple but go well with the type of show (pseudo- slice of life comedy) so are OK, but the weakest point of the series is the animation, it can be awful sometimes, the movement can look sometimes as cardboard just as the drawings sometimes, this is most noticeable in two episodes, the fourth and one near the end, but the movement isn't as important because of the type of series, sometimes the characters just move the mouth walk or make other simple corporal gestures and really it only looks horrible in two episodes. 
Sound 
The sound is good, as well as the voice acting The opening really doesn't go with the series it is very light toned, but the ending, it is pure madness and paranoia, it has the same tone of the series. 
Enjoyment 
As I said it has many psychological themes in it and touch them in a very excellent and realistic way, the black humour is also great and an important part of the story, if you enjoy this type of humour as well as excellent and realistic characters and mature psychological themes I recommended to you. 
Overral 
A great dark comedy portraying a more realistic and farmers side of the otaku culture, with characters who really feel like humans instead of caricatures, with many beautiful messages like the anti-escapism, and to defeat the great fear of failure as well as a beautiful conclusion. It may be very depressing in the middle and towards the end of the story, but at the last moment is a very optimistic and beautiful piece of work. My personal third favorite anime.

this story was definitely new and interesting (at least to me) 
it will be confusing in the first episode or so, but thats what keeps it interesting. 
the art looked really nice too, especially because of their accuracy with the backgrounds. and i thought their censorship was hilarious so that adds bonus points! the opening theme was amazing and really added to the enjoyment, same with the voice acting (minus a couple of cops in the beginning). characters weren't the best in my opinion, they seemed a little too dry and predictable besides a little stunt a character pulled in episode one. 
all in all, i gave this series an - and will look forward to watching the rest and seeing what happens

Right off the bat, this can automatically be in the running for best anime film of all time simply because its soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. But it's the combination of Daft Punk's semi-ironic/completely-sincere disco house and Leiji Matsumoto's --'s style character design that makes this so stunning. It's a match made in heaven. 
The story features an alien disco band who get abducted by the earth's record industry, get's ""human-washed"" and has their song ""One More Time"" commodified into a hit single. The story is carried by the expressiveness of Matsumoto's design and the mood of the music, which is blended into each scene perfectly. I was fascinated at how on-beat the cuts are, which makes the entire film have a distinct rhythm. The BPM literally matches the intensity of the scene. 
Of course, if you don't like Daft Punk you won't really enjoy this move, but I can say the same about Matsumoto's artwork. It's so reliant on aesthetic that a lot of people might not like it, but I certainly did.

The original star wars? Lord of the rings? There have been countless debates as to what is the best film trilogy of all time. Some would mention the godfather, but part III...come on, don't kid yourselves. I personally would mention Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy, and I would then mention this. 
Rarely, if ever, does animation look this good. There were a couple of shots spread along all three films where I couldn't believe the quality of it. The character design is far beyond what we're used to in monogatari, and that's quite a statement. 
The character development is quite special too. Hanekawa and Araragi have such chemistry here that I almost wish you-know-who hadn't come along and ruined it. I say almost, because doesn't Senjougahara just make things more fun?

Quanzhi Gaoshou, or more better known as The King's Avatar, is unlike any anime I've seen before. Although it deals with gaming, it is not the typical augmented reality or death games you'd see in the infamous Sword Art Online or Btooom!. It is focused on a ""retired"" professional gamer who plays a normal computer game using keyboard and mouse, but with immense skill. And with talent, one would naturally attract attention, fellow skilled players and enemies. And that's what this anime is about... In a few highly condensed sentences. 
* Story: -/-- 
Without spoiling anything much, the story is about the esports scene of a fictional MMORPG game called ""Glory"". The main character, Ye Qiu, is an absolute legend at this game although he has been forced to resign from his professional team due to various reasons. This doesn't stop him from playing Glory, as he finds an internet cafe, works there and starts to make a comeback.  
I think the anime is greatly focused on the esports side seeing as Ye Qiu is constantly surrounded by professional players and is, on occasion, haunted (or even hunted... in-game) by his previous team members. The story itself is quite enjoyable but it can become predictable... As most animes with overpowered characters are. However, it does have commendable originality and it's pretty funny. Overall, it's an enjoyable premise but could be improved since it didn't really feel like there was a complication or problem the characters had to resolve. 
* Art: --/-- 
Alright, why the --? Well that's because when I watched the first episode, I was absolutely blown away by the quality of it all. Watch and you'll see what I mean. The merging of the -D, and highly rendered graphics^ and animation was smooth and appropriate. The character art is very pleasing, and their designs and colour schemes are not over the top. The scenery and backgrounds are amazing and every episode makes me feel as if I'm watching an anime movie, and do not feel low-effort at all. The animation during combat is very smooth and the characters' movements are fluid, realistic and mostly all make sense. 
^Disclaimer: when I say highly rendered, I mean realistic backgrounds and scenery, almost on the level of Shinkai movies (Your Name, Garden of Words, etc.) where it mimics life, or a really good photograph. I do not mean the awkward -D models that are sometimes used in anime (for example in Sailor Moon Crystal or Love Live).  
* Character: -/-- 
The characters are very unique and we see a variety of types of characters. We have the cool dude (obviously Ye Qiu), the cool dude's waifu, the cool dude's tsundere boss, the cool dude's annoying friend, the cool dude's cool dudes and the list could keep going. Haha, hope you get the idea of the amaaazing range of characters. Anyway, most of the characters are easy to watch and you won't be getting angry at anyone for being rude to your favourite character, even if they're the antagonists (since that's their job). There are however, one or two characters that I just wanted to slap sometimes since they were really stubborn.  
Characters are alright, nothing really stands out but there are some special boss-type people that appear from time to time. They're kind of like the characters in Kuroko's Basketball where you'd have characters with ""special abilities"" appear. Characters are easy to watch and understand, so that's good. Majority just aren't particularly memorable. There are those who break stereotypes, which I think is also a good thing, if you want to consider the anime's homeland country China.  
* Sound: -/-- 
Good music during battles keep it hyped up. There are a few scenes where I turn it down a bit because the constant clashing of weapons can get a bit too loud for my liking. The background noises are pretty good in fact since they add a realistic kind of atmosphere to the anime. The opening song is quite nice too and can be catchy after you hear it -- times. Same goes for the ending song. Overall, good sounds and music but during battles it may be too loud. 
* Overall: -/-- 
Because I'd watch it again. It's really good in my opinion since it is engaging, has interesting characters and story, really high quality of art, and I have easy access to it (official uploads on YouTube if you didn't know). 
This would be my first review here! I felt like Quanzhi Gaoshou was deserving of a review and just absolutely had to write one. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves anime and PC gaming, especially RPGs.

Shuffle! is a generic romance harem story, featuring most of what is generally accepted to be good and unfortunately bad about its type of show. For those who have never seen a show of this genre, it's probably a good place to start to accumulate a background on the common traits of these types of shows.  Besides that it's a pretty unexceptional show, and a rather poor adaptation of its related visual novel (having experienced both, I will immediately tell you the visual novel is by far superior). 
Starting with whats good, this show is not particularly animated most of the time being more on the lines of slice of life (although there are a few notable exceptions). That being said it's mostly an aesthetically pleasing show with well drawn characters, and of course, it can't really hurt to have a lot of beautiful girls in the main cast can it? A few dramatic moments here and there did get some good visual emphasis as well. The voice actors (both English and Japanese) are pretty well chosen for the most part, and fans of the visual novel can at least appreciate the reuse of the same Japanese actors. Being based on an eroge, this show does present some obvious nudity, but for the most part it's not overdone, and it's usually humorous, so it generally shouldn't detract from your viewing experience much, if it even does. 
The visual novel doesn't necessarily have the best plot ever, and unfortunately one of the problems with this show is trying too hard to fit too much all at once. Besides the fact that obviously Rin is only supposed to end up with one of the girls, the way Shuffle! attempts to translate all the routes into some kind of relevant single story ends up leaving our main protagonist Rin a very weak and indecisive man. This above all else is the single biggest flaw of Shuffle! the anime, a horrible main protagonist who is never willing to commit to anything, leaving many many people hanging and feeling desperate. This alone makes most of the characters (namely the girls and Rin) have seemingly shallow motivations, and is a primary reason why the visual novel is superior, since there is no indecision on Rin's part when you as the player make all the important choices. 
For the most part the show generally tries to cut and paste stuff that happened from the visual novel into the show. To be fair though, a few things like Kaede's background and maybe to a lesser extent Sia's as well do get directed in a more interesting way than the visual novel presents. So for the sake of saying whether or not the anime does anything to separate itself from the visual novel, there is something to consider. 
All in all Shuffle! is a fairly average show. It's mostly okay, a few good moments here and there, and unfortunately the show is held back by a lame protagonist, who as a result makes much of the plot a lot more lame than it should be.  If you're still curious about learning what the romantic harem genre has to offer, this show is definitely one to consider looking into.

Sword Art Online. I'm sure you all know about it by this point, so I'm not going to go into any details about it so as to familiarize you with it like I would most other anime I would write about. By far the most popular title in ----, if not the past - or - years. I've talked to many of my NON-anime watching friends who tell me they have seen SAO. Of course with this kind of popularity usually comes extreme opinions, and SAO is no exception. In fact, I think SAO is a great exhibit that can be used to showcase the anime community and what they have become. 
Sword Art Online is such an extreme example of diverging opinions that you almost never see people rating it anything between ---, it's always --, --, -, -, -, --, -, -, -, -... etc. For some reason, all those who would normally give it a mediocre rating, instead decide that they hate the show. Why? Because so many other people love it, and they can't comprehend that. They then notice that many of the people who love it are those also love Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, and other mainstream anime. SAO then gets branded as a mainstream anime, and gets shit from a whole chunk of the community. They go into it with a closed mind, and after coming out they only see what they expect to see and proceed to rant about how terrible every single aspect of the show is. And such are the ways of the anime community, which unfortunately in everywhere except Japan, seems to follow whatever ideology /a/ tells them to. 
In case you haven't realized, I am of neither factions. I am neither a rabid fanboy, nor someone who thinks the show is absolute shit for no justified reason. I think it is, at best, mediocre. I also think, at worst, it is mediocre. To me, this anime represents a couple things: a) It epitomizes mediocrity, and b) The convoluted demographic anime is now aiming for. There is nothing particularly good about it, but on the flip-side, there's nothing particularly bad. The story is kind of well written, but has many flaws. The characters are for the most part pretty flawed and poorly written, but not so much that it detracts from the show. They certainly don't add anything, but they don't detract either. The art looks quite nice; some of the landscapes are beautiful. However, I felt that the action sequences left some to be desired. I would like to say that the sound was great, as it featured some solid voice acting along with an OST composed by Kajiura Yuki (!!!), yet there was nothing for Kajiura's tracks to highlight, and none of them stuck out particularly. So while the sound helped set the overall tone of the anime, much like the rest of the show, nothing stood out. 
Yet, with all that being said, without question, it is an enjoyable watch. For those of you debating whether or not to watch it, I'd suggest watching the first few episodes and then deciding if you'd want to continue. I realize that this is what most people will suggest when watching ANY anime, but for many shows the first couple episodes might not give you enough. You might end up dropping a show that could have become your favorite. A personal example for me would be Shinsekai Yori. Honestly, I found the first couple episodes kinda boring, and forgot to watch the next couple. It was only when I picked it back up on a whim a few weeks later did I realize that this was something more than what I had thought it was. Shinsekai Yori is now one of my favorite anime, but if I were to have done the ""- episode trial"" with it, I probably never would have finished it. With SAO, this is not the case. The first - episodes are a wonderful example of what is to come in the rest of the series, as there is never really anything more than those three episodes, but nothing much less either. 
SAO is split up into two overriding arcs, each taking place in two different video games. Sword Art Online, and Alfheim Online respectively. Many people bicker about which arc was better, so I'll share my thoughts on this as well. I thought the first arc, SAO, was much better than the second arc. It wasn't really as much about what the first arc did right, but more what the second arc did wrong. The plot for the second arc seemed to be mainly be a feeble excuse to get them back in some different game. While the plot for the first arc seemed to be relevant and remained interesting throughout, the second arc seemed to be mostly a rehash, where everything that made the first arc work taken out. Without the plot points that made SAO work, they had to create new ones. And so a much more superficial plot was created, complete with some good ol' cousinly incest. For the most part, the second arc just bugged me. It however, through some miraculous force of will, remained entertaining. 
The last thing I want to leave you with is the thought that when it all boils down, all you're doing is watching a -- year old kid play video games. Honestly, you can do that on youtube so much more easily, and instead of -- episodes there are tens of thousands. I personally don't enjoy watching people play video games, so my enjoyment of the show was cut a bit as a result. If I were rating this on a bell curve (Which I normally don't, but for the sake of this review, I will), I'd give SAO a -/--. Not a particularly great story, feeble characters, relatively nice art, and one of Kajiura's poorer works. Yet all together, somehow creates something of an enjoyable experience. 
tl;dr SAO was okay, and people need to learn to calm their tits. -/--

TL;DR – A cute girls show that is never quite sure what cute things they should be doing, Hinako Note feels unfocused whilst at the same time increasingly focusing on the characters bodies. The potential for a good cute girl show was there, but it really needed a redraft or more editorial oversight to achieve it. 
It's not easy starting again in a new city. It's even harder for Hinako, a girl whose social anxiety makes her freeze like a scarecrow when approached by strangers. It wasn't as bad in the countryside, where having a human scarecrow to attract animals away from fields was useful. But it won't do her much good in Tokyo. 
Yet that's partly what drew her there, because she has come up with a solution to overcoming her shyness: acting. After meeting her new house mates – the book-eating Kuina, maid dressing Mayuki & landlady Chiaki – they resolve to form an acting troupe to bring more customers to Chiaki's cafe & maybe even perform on a famous stage. That is if they can find time between all the other cute girl shenanigans they get up to. 
At the start, Hinako Note seems like it will be a spin on the cute girls running a shop set-up that proved popular in Is This Order a Rabbit? There's both a bookshop & a café to split time between, as well as a high school & threatre club – where they meet the final main member of the group; the bratty Yua. However, it flits between settings with abandon, leaving things feeling unfocused & unconnected, particularly as it becomes increasingly episodic. It's almost as though the original author couldn't pick one cute girl location, so tried to have all of them. 
It also has the effect of making Hinako's progression towards overcoming her shyness feel disjointed. The idea is that the acting will cause her to gradually gain in self-confidence so that she no longer freezes when talking to people, which is what happens – twice. While the show generally does a fine job showing her friendships develop over time, her own shyness increasingly seems to come & go when it's convenient.  
One might expect it to have been structured such that, for example, she starts off barely able to talk & ends giving the leading performance on the big stage, symbolising her finally overcoming her anxiety. Alternatively, it could have gradually dropped the idea altogether, perhaps shifting the theme from overcoming your weaknesses to accepting them & finding people who accept you for who you are. Instead it peaks & troughs throughout the series, with apparent breakthroughs being followed by a return to the scarecrow pose the next time it's funny. 
But in some ways that's to be expected, given how the show evolves over its runtime. While it starts out looking like an ensemble anime, all about the importance of friendship & the various relationships between the characters; by about episode six it increasingly seems more about waifu worship & how great Hinako is. Ditsy, vulnerable & air-headed yet also amazing & perfectly proportioned, Hinako quickly becomes the centre of almost everything happening around her. She may not be every viewers favourite character, but she clearly is the director's, it becoming rather eye-rolling by the time a clamshell pillow has been added to her bath scenes like she's some sort of discount Venus.  
There is some indication that this is all meant to be presented from Hinako's point of view. A notebook, presumably Hinako's, is often used as the image to break up segments of the show, perhaps suggesting this is all being taken from her diary (clue is in the name, I suppose). But while that may somewhat explain why the show focuses on her, it doesn't explain the things about her it focuses on. 
To be fair, all of them get a degree of back story & time to further distinguish themselves as characters, though it all feels a bit predictable. Yua has a girl crush on Chiaki that somehow seems to end up being directed, effectively if not explicitly, at Hinako. Mayuki is insecure about her height & being treated like a child while Chiaki is...attractive & responsible? Kuina, despite looking like Konata from Lucky Star, doesn't fill that or really any role. She eats paper & dresses in animal onesies, quirks compensating for lack of character.  
As if wanting to visually parallel this shift, there is progressively more fan-service as the series goes on, particularly once it's revealed what a great body Hinako has. There are two or three of what might be charitably called dress-up episodes, with each one seeing characters striking progressively more risqué poses. The incidental pervy cuts become increasingly so, with body pans escalating to close-ups of T&A while the images used for the next episode previews become increasingly fetishistic - one being of Kuina licking Hinako's foot. A degree of this is to be expected in cute girl shows, but at times Hinako's Note ramps it up to sex comedy levels despite never being one; the lewd parts never feeling in character or particularly connected with what else is going on. 
Oh & since important industry types undoubtedly read every MAL review, I have a request: Please stop using moo sounds to indicate big breasts are on screen. Please, just stop. 
Of course, if this sounds like your kind of thing, then Hinako Note's production does a fine job presenting it. It looks & sounds pretty much as you'd expect, with suitably bright & colourful images, standard but appealing character designs & an upbeat, whimsical soundtrack. There were no notable dips in quality, though a minor but noticeable thing is the increasingly static background characters. By the same token, though, it never really excels, with no memorable animation sequences or the like. The OP & ED are somewhat notable for being the type of music that goes through multiple key & time signature changes, creating a sort of bubbly, schizophrenic mashup of cute girl sounds, unfortunately accompanied by some rather lacklustre dance routines.  
There are some good things in Hinako Note. The characters are likeable, if not utilised to their full potential & some episodes deliver good enough cute girl antics. But it never manages to hold its focus on any one of its ideas for long, even as the camera increasingly focused on the characters vital assets. An okayish show that needed more editorial oversight to become a good one. 
& I didn't even mention the busty - year old club advisor.

This OVA lives up to the whole series. same quality of art, sound.. and brings one more emotional and well written story that in just a few minutes makes us empathize with the characters and their situation. The soundtrack fits perfectly in the narrative and makes us live the story as a awaken dream.  
Even though the theme of lovers separated by war is always present during the main series, in this special episode, this theme gains a new approach, focusing in the anonymous people that have their letters returned because their beloved ones can't be found. The undeniable death knocks on the door of reality that many don't want to open, hoping to find their beloved one on their door, at dawn. It may be a common subject in romances throughout history, but many times it's hardly accessible. This episode brings the classical to the modern world. One person can not deprive himself from watching this episode. Same is applied to the main serie.

Better buy yourself -- new underpants, 'cause this is plain creepy... 
""Ghost Hunt"" is a really good anime overall. It features a satisfying storyline, the art is really well-made and the sound is on top. I had been on the lookout for a chill-down-the-spine anime, and ""Ghost Hunt"" certainly  fulfilled that demand. It has, of course, its flaws. The characters are well-made, but they aren't exactly deep and complex. On the flip side, the voice actors make a wonderful job. And while the storyline is satisfying, it has its logical flaws here and there, but no one's perfect. But you get what you... *cough* paid for. 
""Ghost Hunt"" has its memorable moments, if you can call downright heart-stopping moments and stuff leaving its traces on your retina memorable. I'm talking ""Ghost in the Shell: Innocence"" times three (honestly, that OVA is just f*cked up. Made me check my closet before I went to bed). But that's what makes it special: It actually makes an honest effort in scaring you sh*tless, and it succeeds from time to time.  
So all in all its an anime worth watching, unless you're faint of heart. You get -- episodes of pure enjoyment and looking-over-your-shoulder moments. I'm sleeping with my lights on tonight, after I've boarded up the windows and armed myself with a BFG.

Well, this review proceeds as follows: I will speak only of these episodes, not the entire saga. Here I will review only the points of this first part of Stardust in anime, that is, it will not enter criticism to the next part, as villains and etc. My review on Part - will get all the rave reviews about the entire bow that was adapted from the manga. 
Story: Well, here we have something complicated, one point I would like to put about it, is this: the story is not very rich, it is not a bad story, but, it manages to pass the feeling of adventure very well. In this part of the anime, we have several scenes where they focus on the geographical locations, this is very good, because for an adventure anime this is necessary. The change of scenery, according to the famous places they go by, is something excellent and well done. 
Speaking of the proposed story, she tackles events from part -, and intends to end the confrontation Joestars vs. Dio. To summarize: Stardust's story in this first part, does not have many deep moments, does not have much development, but ends up hitting the adventure and environmentalism, that is, it is a very medium and fun story. 
Arte e som: A arte em anime, é muito bem feita, e isso foi um acerto muito grande da DP, pois o manga é antigo, e seus traços seriam ruins para um anime atual. O anime ainda mantém as características do autor, mas com um tom mais moderno e suavizado. A animação não é ruim 
Som: David Productions é uma das melhores produtoras quando se trata de efeitos sonoros. Durante toda a parte, temos uma qualidade imensa nas edições de áudio. As trilhas sonoras não decepcionam, mas não são sensacionais ou grandiosas.  
Here's the point where I really want to talk. 
The characters are not exactly amazing on technical issues, and half of them follow a template created in that saga, the model of facing a ""villain"", he being defeated, and then begin to help the protagonists. 
Basically the motivations are not deep, they are not very complex, but they are fun, they work well inside the anime, and they are not incoherent. 
What I will say now, I will repeat in my next review, the characters of SC, although they are not the best, are the most striking among ALL parts of Jojo's. Maybe this is not a rule, maybe someone has been more captivated by other characters from other parties, but the majority of them are the most charismatic and captivating, talking about secondary characters who are essentially protagonists. 
Finally, I had a great time with this first part. It really was a unique and different experience, especially by the author inserting the stands in the manga universe. 
What you need to expect from SC in this first part is basically a completely different experience from the previous ones (Phatom Blood and Battle Tendency), enemies with miraculating powers, almost always crazy solutions, to defeat the enemies, and a dose of humor that pleases often. 
A very average anime, I can not speak much more, because I must remember that this part is one, but in anime, it was divided by technical issues of the producer.

The Psycho-Pass movie is extremely similar in quality to season -, but for completely different reasons. In case you didn't read my season - review, I basically said it was a good effort on a misguided idea. This is a bad effort on a lazy idea. It's got a ridiculous budget so it get's higher scores on everything, but overall it's basically the same. It drops all the Psycho-Pass values of analyzing complex philosophical ideas and goes for a pure Die Hard and Rambo style action vibe. It's a pretty action movie. I'm getting wrecked by the minimum word count again. How many ways can I even say that it's bad?  Maybe I have enough characters now? ye

What can I say about Yosuga no Sora without wanting to bash my head on my keyboard with rage?  
Well it was a Japanese visual novel, starring the male lead, Haruka, three girls from his childhood and his sister. I think you know where this is going... 
Story: The story starts out with Haruka and his little sister, Sora as they go back to their childhood village due to their parent's deaths. Along the way they meet with three girls, Nao, Akira, and Kazuha, all of whom know Haruka from childhood. Throughout the series it shows how Haruka and Sora settle into the village and the four girl's lust for Haruka, since he is, of course, the main character. 
As you can see, the story is typical harem fodder, but this show likes to take it the extra mile by having only one other male character and he gets virtually no screen time. Also, get used to hearing how much they make Haruka look like he's the King of the Womanizers, his SWAG puts Yu Narukami to shame. 
Sound: The sound's pretty good, and by sound I mean the same freaking song being played every - seconds and the terrible OP. Other than that, it has pretty decent voice work. 
Character: Haruka = emotionless bland lead, Sora = Loli - tsundere with a brother complex, Nao = Booby lady (Sorry Litchi!), Akira = Bubbly girl with dark past and Kazuha = Rich girl who hates her rich parents due to rich reasons. Also Ryouhei = BROSEPH, and Kozue = Just There. 
Enjoyment: If I'm being perfectly honest, I only get enjoyment when I see the end credits. EVERYONE in this show is stupid and the fact that some people actually think this show is credible astounds me. 
People, don't waste your time with this, you'll only stay for the sex. Go watch something like Kobato. or Jojo's Bizarre Adventure instead, at least they weren't pure softcore hentai.

""In every age, in every place,  the deeds of men remain the same"" 
""Lay your heart upon the sea of stars"" 
""Somewhere there's a dream in my heart, in the skies of love"" 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a magnum opus, a grand spectacle that is hidden well in the anime universe,  a diamond in the rough reaching a pinnacle of the ""greatest"" anime of all times. I have to respect LogH because naturally, it has a reason why it is top of it's game. Of course,  we have to see that the series is clearly OVERRATED and highly praised but it is for a good reason. Many adore it and many don't, Legend of the Galactic Heroes isn't your anime series with various cliches to hook any average anime watcher. However if this show can keep you hooked through the end then prepared for its epic gloriousness.  
To start off this review,  Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a space soap opera, spanning --- OVAs with a collection of side stories and - movies. The anime boast a very vast complexity of its world and characters which folds a very rich and deep narrative ever put onto an anime. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is also rich in dialogue,  which is cleverly written and relies heavily on the dialogue since it is the main highlight of the show itself. Granted, it can bevery tedious how the dialogue relies itself for exposition but the dialogue is so dense that you'll be stuck glued to the seat watching military officers talks of politics and the others for strategic battle formations.  
Our setting takes place around the --th Century,  near the vastness of space and time. For --- years,  two opposing factions,  The Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, face off in a grueling, intense, and violent battles of which will rule,  Dictatorship or Republican Democracy. Here we introduce our two main characters, Reinhard von Musel later Reinhard von Lohengramm,  an aristocrat brat notorious for his military genius as he rose through the ranks of at a very young age of --. Yang Wenli,  a historian wanting normal life to teach history but with no money to pay for his college funds,  he joins the Free Planets Alliance to allow them to pay for his tuition. Branded as the natural military genius in military tactics, he was well renowned as the Hero of El Facil,  praised and sometimes feared by his comrades.  
Other than the main characters,  the side characters actually serves purpose in the main story as they are given in-depth characterization in which they hugely impacted the story. Characters like Julian,  Mittlemeyer,  Reuenthal, Fredrica, Anne Rose, Hildegard,  and numerous side characters matters in Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  
The space battles in Legend of the Galactic Heroes aren't your typical over the top shounen,   but it stays in touch with the grounded realism of war and combat.  The space battle relies heavily on military strategies and tactics, much as real life military strategies. While it is slow and maybe tame at best,  the battles are still very intense thanks to the epic orchestral soundtracks and characters occupying which holds a very memorable piece of entertainment and also analytical aspect. Multiple lasers firing in sync,  battleships sunk into bits of chunks of metal, soldiers brutally murdered in horrific scenes of gore-splatters,  acts of suicidal attempts,  and many dramatic and intense battle scenes. Truly masterfully crafting in space battle action 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes' own narrative consist of politics, war, and even small talk of romance and comedy despite it is a very serious and grim anime. The morality within the main characters and side characters simplifies that there isn't truly the antagonist between the two opposing factions because both have their own unique ideals of what truly defines peace and tranquility. Yes, both sides are respectfully likable because you either root for them or bear a grudge. While there is corruption in both sides, they have never lost their pride to fulfill their ambitions. There is no bad side of them but surely they will be fear and grudges between the two opposing factions. Aside from the majority of politics and war, melodramatic moments strongly conveys the conflict in every character themselves. This goes to show that with heavy and clever dialogue and memorable characters benefits character development as well as plot.  
Yes. This is the anime that holds a very deep connection with the characters and the world which you feel very sympathetic of who is the wiser. It is rhetorical but once you go as deep with the characters and story, you'll find answers that you may find relieving.  
As such, why Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a masterpiece is what is right there when you watch it.  The vast complexity of world-building, characterization, narrative, dialogue,  and philosophical theme that takes itself deep in concepts of reality and morality. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is indeed a shining star in the universe,  sailing into the sea of stars and the skies of love. The deeds of men remain the same as conflict of two factions fighting for their beliefs.

Do you feel like you didn't get enough MD Geist in your life? 
Fear not, the brave souls at [hopefully defunct anime studio] made sure to make more MD Geist for your viewing pleasure. 
MD Geist II is a brilliant deconstruction of quality anime. That's why it's so terrible. Most people that have watched this show have gone to the hospital with brain hemorrhages. Soon after, the poor victims die and have to be thrown out with the hazardous waste to only be buried in toxic waste dumps. 
The script is the brain-child of a ---year-old kid that watched too many action flicks and was juiced on steroids and wielding a Nintendo Power Glove. This was the masterpiece that was produced. 
This show follows the continued murder spree of the Most Dangerous Soldier in existence ""Geist."" There is another MD in this show, the main antagonist, Krauser. He was probably so named because it probably sounded German enough, and all Germans in fiction are evil, right? Did I forget to mention the Death Force that Geist released so that he could murder them as well? 
Geist is an antisocial psychopath that really hates it when people talk to him, or anyone else. So he will kill anyone that speaks. I've probably spoiled the entire show with that sentence, but it's the truth. There's only one sentence in MD Geist, the death sentence. With that, I'm done.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn’t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is. 
Coming into the series, I had little knowledge about rakugo. It’s a form of Japanese art performed on stage using creative dialogues, expressions, and body language. Quite frankly, it’s very entertaining once you get the feel of it despite the performer being stationary. Most of the time, the performances involves a comical act that goes along with a story. Sometimes, the performer brings in drama and bittersweet emotions but the bottom line is that it’s described to entertain. That’s what this show has done: bringing entertainment in a rarity form. 
The story takes place around the ----s. However, the show does a lot more background storytelling than what most viewers may be accustomed to. Thankfully, the series knows how to transit into the past to bring the story into the present. From the beginning, we meet Koji, a guy who got out of prison but later follows a goal to make himself into a professional rakugo performer. This sets up his encounter with Yakumo Yurakutei, a man who he looks up to and wants to learn from. After many exchanges and work, he does earn himself a spot as Yakumo’s student. This is where transition comes in and we take a look at the past. 
In essence the storytelling brings in a lot of relationship dynamics and characterization. The relationship between Yakumo and Sukeroku is a prominent example of this as we see their connection. Furthermore, the show makes us realize how different they are after examining their personalities. Yakumo is the stoic type with a cyclical personality and little intense of the opposite sex. Meanwhile, Sukeroku is just the opposite who often seeks girls in his life while maintain his hyperactive personality. Despite this, the two seems to get along as good friends and strives to become rakugo artists. There’s quite a difference in their performance skills though as we can easily see how much Sukeroku is better than Yakumo. Throughout the series, Yakumo struggles at first to make a name for himself but does manage to pick up the pace once he realizes it.  
At some point in the show, we should realize that Yakumo really strives to become an artist. This is evidenced by his lack of interest in Miyokichi, a beautiful geisha who seems to have quite an affection for him. However, they do connect in some ways. While romance isn’t a prominent part of the show, it does play a role as we can easily see some budding romance between the two. Furthermore, there’s also Sukeroku who seems to be smitten by Miyokichi. Get the picture? What this brings is how complex the trio’s relationship can be. Yakumo and Sukeroku has become close to the point that they almost seems like brothers. When Miyokichi enters the story, it almost feels like she’s a wall between the two. Meanwhile, Yakumo seems to only be in love with rakugo and strives to be better, something that he actually succeeds later on in the series. To say the least, love in this series is beyond dramatic and even has a tone of tragedy to it. I also find it amusing that the show mixes in some gender bender at one point to spice up the sexuality vibes. However, it’s mostly played down as a form of art to get viewers comfortable with the style of the show; in that being artistic with its storytelling. 
What I find very capitalizing about the show is the personalities of the characters. Yakumo seems to have a dual personality, one that’s stoic with his reserved behavior while other times behaves like a gentlemen to entertain the audience. On the other hand, Sukeroku is more like the guy who seems casual all the time and easy to make friends with. Miyokichi has perhaps the most complicated personality as she seems to want certain people like Yakumo but her motivations aren’t truly clear. Is she manipulative? Maybe. Is she fragile? In some ways, yes. Is she a bit too hopeless to be romantic? Who knows really. However, it should be noticeable that she realizes about Yakumo’s personal feelings and unfortunately, she isn’t really part of what he has in mind for. The show capitalizes on this emotional drama and later really makes a climax out of it, something that is very memorable. Later on, we’ll also see how other characters enters the show because of their tragic relationship. 
Despite the insightful storytelling and characterization, the rakugo performances are also quite entertaining. The first episode (being double length) gives good insight about what rakugo really is like with the style, body language, dialogues, and storytelling of the performer. Despite the performer being stationary, it’s fairly interesting to see how they act out each play. The stories themselves each contain a theme but always prominent characters that switches between tone and mannerism according to the story. While Yakumo and Sukeroku does differ a bit between their performances, it can easily be observed that the two strives to be the best at what they do. And that’s something really inspiring. 
DEEN actually puts on quite a decent effort into the artwork for this series. I’m honestly surprised but the visual quality is stellar. It’s also realistic to portray the ----s with the backgrounds and simple structures. Furthermore, characters are dressed in the way that is believable. Between character designs, the rakugo performances is also an art in itself and the choreography for the show is really well delivered with clever camera angles. This is even enhanced by the creative body languages. Character expression is important and this show nailed the coffin in that not just on stage but also between character interactions in real life. From Miyokichi’s emotional breakdowns to Sukeroku’s joyful acting, it’s quite something to look at. 
Soundtrack has more of a Japanese feudal tone to it, like something from the past. It’s able to capture the feel of a performance with the character voice mannerisms. In addition, the show isn’t shy to deliver dynamic dialogues especially with characters like Miyokichi. The OP and ED songs also has an unique feel that adds more to the show. 
Ah how I wish this show could have lasted longer. But from what it’s worth, the series really attempted t do something refreshing and unique. It capitalized on every theme and way a story should be told and it damn well delivered. Characterization remains strong while we get realistic human emotions that is easily recognizable. From the clever delivery of the dialogues to powerful chemistry between characters, it’s a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.

first time give a review 
when you look at the artwork you will think Mahoujin Guru-Guru is recommended for kids or someone who like cute characters, but thats not entirely true  
its a remake from old anime my favourite in --s that parody of rpg adventure that used to popular around ----s,----s era that can captivate vieawer of some retro games likes final fantasy, etc. But they add it with a slapstick comedy. 
Story& Enjoyment: The Story it's actually really good, but compare to the first version, the comedy quality quite lacking because the pace is quite fast, i cannot fully enjoy the comedy because of the pace. maybe because it should have -- eps but they only get -- eps, so they accelerate some of the story   
Art: the art is better than the previous series for sure 
Sound: i am amaze that the sound almost same as it used to be 
Overall: 
These anime is very crazy and funny, I really recommended these anime especially if you are like comedy or gamers especially from --s, if you feel these pace quite fast, i recommend the first version

Video game to anime, especially fighting based has never really been anything above average. Usually, these types of movies will mostly appeal to fans of the franchise and give nothing to the non fans. But could it actually be possible to create a video game to anime that appeals to absolutely no one? Well, after watching Art of Fighting, the answer is yes. Surprisingly, it does have a cult following but only for mocking reasons. However, I wouldn't recommend it even for that. I've seen my fair share of train wrecks, and I can say without any doubt that Art of Fighting is the worst anime I have ever seen. 
Directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi, Art of Fighting is based on the Neo Geo fighting game of the same name. It was one of the arcade fighters competing with Street Fighter II for arcade supremacy, and with the exception of the anime featuring the characters of the game. The movie has absolutely nothing to do with the game at all. 
When watching an anime based on a video game. I don't think it's very important to follow the source material to the very last detail. Especially, when the video game doesn't have a great story to begin with; but there's one key element that should never be neglected and it's characterization. In regards to fighting games, there will always be a character with at least a handful of fans. Therefore, fans will be looking for someone specific. 
I have to beat on the characterization. The two heroes come off as total dimwits, and I couldn't find a single reason to care about them. They had no charisma, they weren't funny, there was nothing cool about them at all. There also isn't a single interesting villain either. Everyone is completely one dimensional, very corny, and just plain boring. 
When these types of movies are released fans want to see their favorite characters going at it with special moves included. Something Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat, and even Fatal Fury - did a pretty good job at. Art of Fighting doesn't even deliver there. The battles are completely unimaginative with the poorest choreography I have seen in an anime since Voogies Angel, and the characters don't pull off any of their special moves, which is a no-no on the highest level. That's like watching a XXX porno with no sex. 
I doubt anyone is expecting high art when coming into a martial arts anime, especially when it's based on a game; but the plot really doesn't have anything going for it besides a few non entertaining fights with incredibly bad dialogue to boot, and I'm almost lost for words when trying to describe the horrendous production values. Art of Fighting isn't even good to look at. The animation is choppy and very poor on its delivery. The artwork and character designs are also just as bad despite the characters being somewhat faithful to their video game counterparts. Except for Ryo, whom for some reason is sporting black hair instead of blond. Fatal Fury which is also a Neo Geo release turned anime makes a similar mistake, yet it's nowhere near as awful as this on any level. 
The soundtrack is non engaging and uninspiring with bad voice acting to top it off. The movie is seriously bad on every level one can think of and good grief that ending. Ryo uses a diving board to leap about -- feet into the air in order to pursue an escaping helicopter, which explodes for a reason I still haven't caught. 
Art of Fighting accomplished the impossible by doing everything wrong. Unlike other really bad anime titles that could have been a lot worse; Art of Fighting really couldn't be any worst. I do not recommend this to anyone. I still do not think I'm qualified to put together a top -- best or worst list because there's still more things I need to see, but I'm definitely sure this will still be sitting comfortably at number - on the worst, since its still been there for over a decade. 
Whenever I get through a very bad anime I always say to myself, ""well it's not Art of Fighting"". This golden turkey is a -- minute long waste of time. Give this a try if you love to waste money and time, or love to search for some type of enjoyment in very bad movies. Me, I'll just try to forget its very existence but the alcohol has been failing. 
Highs: What kind of animal is that? 
Lows: They are in very large supply here.

**SPOILER FREE REVIEW** 
What’s more important: the destination, or the journey it takes to get there? If you put every ounce of your blood, sweat and tears towards achieving your goal, and still fail, was it all for nothing? Inversely, if you accomplish all of your goals without breaking a sweat, are you really accomplishing anything? Due to the fact that the outcome of nearly every shounen anime every made is never in any real question what so ever, this is not a theme we have ever seen explored in anime. At least, not until Katanagatari was released. This anime is perhaps the only show ever made that can justifiably be called a proper deconstruction of the modern shounen; it takes the aspects and clichés that you would ordinarily assume about a narrative and promptly beats you over the head with them. It examines the inner workings and conceptual concepts of the genre and makes you completely rethink the priorities of storytelling. As if that weren’t enough, it also proceeds to accomplish all of this without sacrificing an ounce of entertainment, comedy, action, wit, pacing, or essentially anything. This anim- …no… This MASTERPIECE deserves a hell of a lot more credit than it gets, even if it isn’t perfect. Presenting one of my all time favorites: Katanagatari. 
Synopsis: Yasuri Shichika, the -th successor of the Kyoto Ryu style sword art, lives on an isolated island with his older sister, Nanami; he has never had any other human contact. One day, the island is visited by a woman named Togame, who requests his aid in her quest to find and collect the twelve legendary swords forged by the master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki. And thus, the “Sword Story” begins. 
At first glance, Katanagatari’s storyline is nothing special. In fact, in may take you quite a few glances to realize that there is more to this simple “Sword Story” than you are made to initially think. Largely episodic in nature, each episode consists of Shichika and Togame locating and obtaining one of the -- swords. Conveniently, there are -- episodes in the show (each of them twice as long as a normal anime episode, doing wonders for the pacing of the anime). Now, that information alone might make you assume quite a few things. However, you’re going to want to take my advice: Don’t. Katanagatari teaches you relatively early on that you should not assume a single thing about it. It is NOT an average shounen. Episode -, perhaps the most trolltastic anime episode ever aired, is more than enough to demonstrate this. This show doesn’t just avoid its genre’s traditional tropes, it laughs in the face of them. It completely dismantles what an average plot might consider to be important and demonstrates the things that are REALLY important when you are telling a story: Character development, motivations, pacing, engaging dialogue, and much more. It’s genius. Pure and utter genius. Katanagatari makes fun of or completely deconstructs an uncountable number of clichés, and yet it always does so with the most impeccable sense of execution and taste. Ah, but I’ll stop clumsily trying to discuss the show’s themes while attempting to avoid spoilers. Let’s get to the other aspects of the storyline: 
Something you will initially notice about this anime is that is has a LOT of dialogue. Don’t get me wrong, there is certainly a very fair share of action, but the majority of the screen time is spent showing the characters having conversations with one another. The reason that this is a good thing is because it’s VERY well written dialogue; sometimes hilarious, sometimes deep, but always witty and/or thoughtful. One of the best scripts I’ve ever seen. The emotional highs are high, the emotional lows are low, the comedic timing is flawless when applicable, and the show always seems to know just what to say. Katanagatari covers the entire range of the emotional spectrum; it will make you feel EVERY emotion. I can’t say the same thing for any other anime I’ve ever watched, or at least not to the same extent. The one and only complaint I can make about the storyline is that it gets a bit lax when fleshing out its plot developments toward the end, but none of it really matters in the end. Did I mention that this series has, quite possibly, the greatest final episode in anime history? Enough said. 
If you want to know how to write good characters, look no further than Katanagarari’s incredibly memorable, masterfully written and downright lovable cast. Y’know how Cowboy Bebop became wildly popular because of its ability to introduce new characters every episode and still end the episode arc with them feeling fully fleshed out (among other things)? Well, Katanagatari does it even better. From compelling backstories to unique personalities to complex motivations, the side characters in this show are among the greatest and most interesting in the entire medium considering the circumstances. However, even without them, the character cast would be totally unforgettable thanks to the duo of Shichika and Togame; both of whom are some of my favorite characters of all time. Shichika, besides being likable, is one of the finest examples of character development I’ve ever seen. His thoughts and actions carry unfathomable thematic weight and his personality is unique as well as perfect for the tone of show. Did I mention that he is also a badass? Shichika is quite possibly my favorite anime character of all time; he was written so goddamn well that it’s inspiring. Togame is just as complex as Shichika, but her motives are shrouded in mystery. Really, before anything else, Togame should be lauded for being one of the most likeable characters ever conceived. She is laugh out loud hilarious, full of energy, absurdly adorable, and STILL manages to command the respect of the viewer and be legitimately multi-facetted. Really, I struggle to find the words to do this pair justice. Easily the highlight to an already incredible show, and I haven’t even mentioned that the character designs are astonishingly awesome; easily my all time favorite. What a stupendous job by the writers in this department. The characters stand out as the best part of an already amazing anime. 
Some people really like the art style of Katanagatari while others dislike it, but I never understood how anyone could possible not think this show looks good. The bold colors and lines are pure eye candy, and I’ve already mentioned that the character designs are the most beautiful, diverse, and creative examples in the industry. The action scenes are animated wonderfully and even the dialogue scenes never seem to lack energy. I LOVED the animation for this show, even though some people disagree for whatever reason. There is much less debate about the music and voice-acting, however, which are both nearly flawless in execution. Katanagatari has maybe the best and most varied original score I’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. From haunting and intense melodies with a traditional Japanese theme to the occasional hip-hop track that gives even the likes of Samurai Champloo a run for its money to everything in between, believe me when I say that this soundtrack has it all. The two OPs really aren’t anything special, but Katanagatari re-aired on television in ---- with a brand new OP, and THAT one is fucking incredible. Probably the most underrated OP of all time, and one of my personal favorites. When it comes to presentation, I struggle to find a single thing to complain about. 
I hate to end this review with a cliché (ironically), but I’m going to anyway: This anime will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel every emotion in between. It’s intelligent and has tons of depth while being simultaneously entertaining and filled to the brim with charm. If you don't watch Katanagatari, you are doing yourself a major disservice. I highly doubt that there will ever be another anime that manages to balance themes and entertainment as well as this series; it’s one of a kind. Not bad for a Sword Story.

Citrus is sort of like a gore video.  You know you shouldn't continue, you know it's only gonna get worse, you know you'll regret it, and yet you can't take your eyes off of it.  The viewing experience turns into a sort of analysis of trying to pinpoint all the ways in which the show is terrible, and articulating them.  Now that time has come to properly verbalize all these ideas for the --- MAL users that will ever read these words.  Shoutout to you guys, remember to upboat.   
Citrus actually presents us with a pretty solid first episode.  Sure, when you hear ""all girls school"" and ""student council president"", you should already have extremely loud alarm bells telling you to abort the mission. Despite that, it gave me a sliver of hope for what was to come.  It had some funny elements, and the twist of the semi-rape by the teacher spiced things up and left me wondering if this could be some kind of dark abuse story.  I could have been more wrong, but i would have had to go to great lengths, like thinking ""hey communism sounds like a dank idea"".  Already from episode -, the downward spiral begins, and the acceleration only comes to a stop on the final minute of the last episode, when the viewer smashes into the bottom of the barrel at breakneck speed, shattering whatever was left of his sanity.   
Citrus boasts some of the worst writing I've ever seen in any television show ever, including School Days.  The ""characters"" are just tools for the author to go through her check list of different girl-fan-service scenes.  The ""girl"" qualifier here is important.  You will get no tiddies, but you will get almost exclusively abusive semi-rape kissing scenes; because we know that's the only way females can get off (looking at you, -- shades).  Every single exchange of dialog is complete non-sense, characters routinely come and disappear without any kind of explanation.  For example the teacher that was assaulting Mei in episode -?  You never hear about him again after that scene.  Seriously.  He presented his fan service, and having outlived his usefulness, was discarded by this dumpster tier ""author"" without even a mention.   
This is the kind of show where conflict is ENTIRELY rooted in vapid feeling-based quarrels between the characters (see Scum's Wish, another prime example).  And naturally, these trivial events are being portrayed as life-changing catastrophes, and we're supposed to buy it.  Worry not, our precious characters will not be burdened by real issues such as poverty, violence, or illness.   X said something that made me angry!  Woe is me!  It makes you wonder, is this really how women see the world?  Is this the most touching source of drama they can conjure?   
The bright side is that this allows you, the viewer, to play the ""new character"" game.  The goal is simple : you have to guess when a new character will be introduced out of the blue.  Citrus makes this very simple, you know that as soon the current petty feud comes to a close, the brilliant author will run out of ideas, and copy paste some bullshit new girl.  I'm happy to report that i have properly predicted the apparition of almost all of the characters!   
For instance near the end, this new character comes in.  She becomes ""shinyuu"" (close friend) with heroine A within - day of meeting her.  And, behold, she falls in love with heroine B within that same day, confesses to her, and B agrees to go out with her.  They have all met in the last -- hours.  If this happened between boys and girls, it would already be completely fucking retarded, but the fact that all the interactions are homosexual drives the non-sense up to -- and shatters any sense of reality.  I'm willing to concede that of this extremely sloppy rushing may partly be due to the short anime adaptation.  But there is still not even the sliver of a doubt in my mind : this author is an absolute idiot, and would get outdone by the majority of teenagers writing a short story for their -th grade English class.  
In light of all this, Citrus is a fun trainwreck.  The stupidity is jaw-dropping.  You won't be able to look away; you will want to know how bad it gets.  And when you think you reached peak absurdity, it will get dumber.  As a bonus, you have well drawn, beautiful girls to keep your eyes busy while you analyze the shitfest.   
This is this decade's School Days; truly awful, but almost a must-watch for that reason.

No matter how comically deep Kenji Kamiyama attempts to go as he tries - and fails - to imitate Ghost in the Shell, he will never, EVER be Mamoru Oshii. 'Tis a a sad but very true fact~ 
The very existence of Cyborg and that it somehow qualified as a movie, with its PS--esque cutscene CG, is a rather damning indictment of how far the anime medium has fallen since the --'s and --'s. Long gone are the days of large budgets being given to creative geniuses like Kawajiri and Oshii. Today, all we get are knock-off imitators and imitations. 
Now, that is not to say Cyborg is ALL bad: during some of the action, such as when the sexy female cyborg dives from the sky like Motoko in GitS and the protagonist Joe is either hopping between rockets or outrunning a nuclear blast in accelerated slow-mo, you can almost forgive how basic and stiff it all looks. The action sequence direction + Kenji Kawai's forever nostalgically epic music temporarily raises the film above itself. But --% of the time all you get to see is static CG talking heads that look absolutely atrocious. I cringed even at the start when buildings fell into each other like lego. There was also an attempt at very awkward lingerie sexy tiem foreplay... 
Making matters far, far worse is the pretentious nonsense-wtf that is the mess this film has as its plot. It is confusing initially since it throws around a dozen characters at you and explains next to sod all, but whatever: it is basically a Stand Alone Complex rip-off with a police team battling political unrest/terrorism... or so I thought, anyway. 
As it turned out, rather than, say, those evil Americans being the big bad, it was God and the Americans being in cahoots with God. Or something. And fossils of giant angels are possessing people. No, really! You see, every human brain is a 'God', able to a hear a voice, and some decide that skyscraper buildings go against Allah's wishes... so they suicide bomb them and/or fire missiles from military ships. My mouth was agape during the --min static 'explanation' of this, in case anyone is curious. 
Perhaps fittingly, the film ends in space, with Joe riding a nuclear missile because... logic? I actually laughed out loud when he stood on the rocket, despairing, and shouted ""GAAAAAAWD!!!--!"" as if the dub voice actor had been cast in the Devilman OVA. He flies off into the distance, arms outstretched, it explodes... and the film ends with everyone magically alive because God used his Deus ex machina powers. Seemingly, God was not quite as concerned for Dubai during the earlier events of the movie. There are just no words other than 'WHAT!?'

This was way better than i ever expected it to be, a little drug out maybe but it was still very good. 
Story: misaki is from a poor family and works at a maid cafe to help support her family(cuz her dads an ass, and walked out leaving a huge debt) but she doesnt want anyone to know because she thinks that she will lose respect at school. This is a concern because she is a the student body president at a predominantly boys school but one day a boy finds out but it becomes their secret.  
Art: this goes from conventional art to turning everyone into chibis and just doing that more comical style in every episode and i love that.  
Characters: Misaki is about the biggest tsundere ever, and holy crap dude, she is so cute when they she shows that side. She hates guys however(because of her dad obviously) and is skeptical of Usui the whole time, just assuming that he's perverted and sexually harrassing her. Usui looked to me like he was going to be a dick in the cover photo, but he is the exact opposite and I was able to breath a sigh of relief when i found that out. Hes actually a pretty nice generous dude, and he is in love with misaki and kinda just has to keep on her until she figures out out. 
Enjoyment: This was a very humorous show and i can really appreciate that, and I like romances so i have two reasons to love this. Plus it has a fairly original story so I really cant say anything bad about this at all. One thing is that it just sort of ends, on the edge of definitively but I still had a lot of fun watching this and I would recommend it.

The anime is amazing. Actually Shippuden is better than the original Naruto series. The original Naruto was way too immature with Naruto acting too much Shit and ---% determination with no brains whatsoever(I dont konw how the plan to beat Neji came to his mind alongside Kiba), but in Shippuden, the Naruto was much more mature, rational, logical and everything he did made sense.The most epic part being his promise to free the world from the curse of hatred.(Not his hokage dream or Sasuke revival). 
The only thing that hampers its productive abilities is the amount of fillers and flashbacks. But believe me; skip through them and you will find Shippuden the most beautifully pesented anime ever. 
Story: Well the strory has grown more complex than the original Naruto.  The plot seems to join all the stones ever in the ninja world history to be unturned. But Shippuden has a weakness which Naruto dosent have; thats character depth of some people.ROCK LEE turns out from something into nothing.The overall background strorytelling of the character's had again lived up to its reputation.--/-- for strory. 
Sound: Naruto dosent really have the fighting OSTs which gap is filled by Attack On Titan, but the soundtracks which Shippuden presents is sad, emotional, beautiful and soothing. The "" Sage of six paths death theme"" and ""The guts to never give up"", being my favourites. But the first spot is STILL held by ""Wind"" from Naruto.--/-- for sound. 
Characters: The characters have grown incredibly powerful with some people coming into action like the hokages, Madara, Obito. The series also has my favourite villain- PAIN and my fav characetrs of course- NARUTO and ITACHI .--/-- for characetrs.  
Now, I reacommend that please people skip through the fillers and dont spred any rot about this epic. --/-- for overall presention.(ignoring the fillers).

Nah man, nah. There are five girls who NEED this one room for their own personal reasons and it's just a harem of bullshit. At best it was a cute anime. There were battle scenes that took place just by coincidence and everyone's friendship came together to help the person in trouble every time.  At one point, an antagonist went to talk to a high-council type group to exact revenge on room --- (or whatever it was) and we never heard from them again.  The story was rushed to get through all girls' storylines and it was just generally too much.

I love romances. I really do. I enjoy sitting down and letting my brain melt over these silly little animu relationships. 
Chobits is not a romance. 
Chobits is not some sort of intellectual look into if robots were real and sentient.  
Chobits disappointed me. Chobits is a fetish show. A rip off of a fetish show.  
Story: - 
If you enjoy watching a brain dead girl walking around saying underpants over and over again, this show is for you. If you enjoy ecchi and porn, this show is for you. If you were told, like me, that this show discusses how robots and humans would become in a futuristic society, you were deceived. The plot likes to shove morals in your face constantly and then in the end basically says the morals apply to everyone but Chi because Chi is Chi.  
Yeah. Also, two random recap episodes. Or maybe three, I honestly don't care enough to go back and look. There are bits and pieces of promising plot, but sadly it's overshadowed by ecchi and fan service. I'd say a good --% of the show is a perverts dream and the last -% is plot progression. Then it just kinda gives you the middle finger in the end. 
Art: - 
I mean, it isn't horrible. It's pretty a lot of the times. But it can also be kinda lazy at times. It's weird. 
Sound: 
Other than the opening song, which literally became a joke between me and my cousin through our slow decent into insanity as we watched this show, the music isn't terrible. It typically fits the mood.  
The English voice cast was in and out. Some characters did well, and others made you cringe at the sheer inability to read a line. From what I remember the Japanese voice cast is okay. 
Now here's the thing, and this is probably going to be a bit of a spoiler but honestly it doesn't matter you probably will guess what's going on by the second episode. Chi's personality, even by the end of the show when she ""fully blossoms"" is robotic in nature. She speaks, acts, and is just obviously a robot. DESPITE supposedly being the only robot that has emotions. But then you look at the little robot that follow Hideki around that was his neighbors robot (Again I honestly don't care enough to google it's name) Has WAAAAAAAAAY more personality than her. She was the only character I liked and I don't even remember her name. Speaking of which... 
Character: - 
I don't think I've ever thought that characters could get this cardboard cutout and predictable. There are no round characters. No one learns anything. Hideki has morals shoved in his face but he igores them anyway and does the exact opposite, despite being told it will only bring despair. ""But DellaDellsies,"" You say, ""It was for LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!""  
... NO. IT WAS NOOOOT FOR LOVE. IT WAS FOR HIS LUST. THERE IS NOOOOTHING ABOUT CHI TO LOVE. HER PERSONALITY IS LITERALLY SHAPED BY HIDEKI. EVERYTHING she knows is what HIDEKI told her. He does not love Chi, he loves what he made her out to be. Because she is a ROBOT and can DOOO THAAAT. This was not a story about love, it was a story about an idiot not listening to any of his friends and choosing a man made, perfect girl over any other human girl. THAT'S IT.  
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON CHI. ""Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants!"" I'm going to leave it at that because I honestly don't know how to put it without making even worse spoilers than I have already put.  
Enjoyment: - 
There were some side characters and side plots that were interesting, but it never stuck around and was over shadowed by the bland, boring Hideki and the annoying, sexual Chi. I got nothing but anger and disappointment from this show. 
Overall: - 
If you want to experience this for yourself, go ahead and do it. But honestly I believe it's a waste of time. It has sooooo much potential and it just fell flat on its face. Literally there were times when my cousin and I were just like ""Okay THIS will be the scene that wows us!"" and it just falls flat into a boob or fingering joke. The comedy was flat, the plot just went in circles until the last episode where it literally shoved the whole plot into your face then continued to suffocate you with giant tits and a moral that is tossed into the garbage. By the end of it you just kinda break.  
Or at least my cousin and I did.  
Her ringtone on my phone is now Let Me Be With You out of sheer spite of making me watch that show.

Every genre has its entries that define how you should do a show of this genre. K-On! is the king of CGDCT/Slice of Life-Moe anime and shows what to expect of the genre, it gives a good idea of if the genre is for you. 
Personally, I don’t need a great story of any story at all in a CGDCT anime or even basic things like character development. A good CGDCT-show can focus on its two main aspects: The cute girls and the cute things they are doing. Add some music of magic or any other fun thing, it should be fun, and you are on the best way to make an entertaining and light-hearted piece of animation. 
In K-On!, we follow four girls and their teacher living their carefree lives with drinking tea, eating cake and sometimes actually practicing for their band. There isn’t any bigger plot or conflict, they just handle different everyday situations with their different characters. Just like every Slice of Life show you’ve ever seen.  
Characters are the main aspect of any Slice of Life show, and K-On! Does a pretty good job here. Every girl has personality and are characterized enough to make them different from each other. We have the lazy, but caring girl, the adult, but shy girl, the over-energetic girl and the rich and calm girl. In my opinion, the teacher really stands out here, she tries to leave her wild youth behind and become the loved and respected teacher she wants to be, but she also wants to be friends with the girls and make daring costumes for them. The cast works well together and you end up loving them, not for a specific character, but for their interactions and friendship. Everything you could imagine them doing can be justified by one of the characters. They are having a training camp in a huge house at the beach? Mugi’s rich parents own it. Need some amazing costumes over night? Sawako can make them. Forgot to get permission for sleeping in school? Good thing we are friends with the president of the student council. 
Music is always matter of taste, but I really liked it because it's light-heated and really suits the girls' personalities. 
In conclusion, K-On! suffers from the same problems many CGDCT and SOL anime suffer from. If you the characters, the whole experience is ruined, because the whole show is focusing the characters. But if you start to like the characters and their quirks, you start enjoying every minute of the show, seeing their friendships develop and overcoming every problem they encounter. This season is in my opinion the weaker one of the two, in season - they do more interesting things and there is some conflict and character development.

I’ve always had mixed feelings about the show where the esper, the alien, the time traveler, and the normal highschool student all gathered together to entertain that certain ecstatic girl. However, as time passed by, it ended up being one of my favourite guilty pleasures. How could I forget the super fun misadventures of the SOS Brigade? Kyon’s snarky attitude? Haruhi’s one of a kind personality? And, most of all, Mikuru’s tea? 
The series, though arguably mediocre, had some very fun moments. So where does this movie, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, stand?  
Story/Presentation: I’m going to skip over the synopsis, since you can already read one with a button away. Due to the hype behind this film, it’s practically common knowledge that this movie has a complete different tone compared to the hyperactive series. It starts off like any other episode from the show, and then slowly transitions into a more solemn tone. Sure, it isn’t dark as something Gen Urobuchi would write, but in contrast to the series, it’s quite the difference. The use of tone is used well, and it helps make the movie feel a lot more believable than the show (assuming you have a suspension of disbelief).  
Though the tone was one of the film’s highpoints, I can’t help but feel that it makes it a tad, just a tad, disjointed from the series. People expecting more misadventures from the original show will be sorely disappointed in this movie’s change for a serious plot.  
The pacing also deserves mention. The beginning of the film is very slow and deliberate, and though many people may criticize it for being boring, I found it to be good writing. Sure, it may seem a bit dragging at times, and it really doesn’t pick up until a big plot twist ¼ of the movie in, but that’s the writer’s intention. It’s supposed to give the viewer the sense of the dull normal world Kyon’s facing after Haruhi’s disappearance, this being reality. 
In terms of the story itself, it turns out to be quite the intricate tale, at least compared to the series. Many plot twists come along the way, and for the most part, the film remains unpredictable. Time travel also has a big role, and it really made me think, which is something I can’t say for the show.  
However, my favourite part about the story is how it uses past events from the series, as many subplots and character motivations come back and play their role here. When it comes down to it, the writing here has moments of absolute brilliance.  
Its connection to the series can be, to some, a downfall, as this isn’t a standalone. To watch this, the viewer must have knowledge of the first two seasons. Another flaw of this film is its association to the source material. It leaves a few plot threads dangling and a few unanswered questions by the ending (I will refrain from spoilers), and until we get more of the series animated, these plot threads will remain unanswered (unless you consult said source material).  
Characters: I loved the eccentric cast from the series. Sure, they mostly followed typical stereotypes, but they did so in a refreshing matter that made them memorable. If there’s one thing that bugged me about the series, it is the lack of characterization. Though one shouldn’t expect much of such from a slice of life show, it was shame that most of the characters weren’t given much depth on their own and in their relationships. In addition, they never really felt like real people. 
This is yet another highlight of the movie. Kyon is our point of view in this movie, and after Haruhi disappears, all his motivations and interactions with other characters are completely believable. The best part of his characterization comes to play when he starts to question whether he prefers the supernatural world he always complained about or the normal life he wanted from the beginning. His decision regarding that aspect says a lot about his character.  
Another character I’d like to mention is Yuki Nagato. We’ve all known her as the monotone emotionless alien/robot, and now we see her as a quite shy bookworm. How she got that way comes from her motivations from the previous season, and her actions in this movie really strengthens our view of her as a character. Did she really feel nothing throughout all the events of the original show? Is she really the emotionless drone we all thought she was?  
Surprisingly, Haruhi herself, despite being part of the driving force, doesn’t get as much screen time as one might expect. That’s not to say she was used poorly, and on that note, all the side characters were used well and they each held their respective purpose in the movie strongly. 
Art/Animation: Ah, Kyoto Animation. Feast your eyes, ladies and gentlemen, for this movie is a visual ecstasy when it comes to Japanese animation. The visual quality for the original series was already top notch, so just imagine Kyoto Ani squishing that entire budget on a - hour and -- minute movie. I don’t think I need to say much more than that this film, from a visual standpoint, is absolutely stunning. The colours are vibrant and the animation is smooth.  
Speaking of the colours, they compliment the movie very well. In the beginning, the colours are bright to show the spunky life of the SOS Brigade, and when the movie transitions in tone, the colours become subtly darker to really drive home the dullness of an ordinary life. This is just a subtle but noticeable change, and that’s what I love about it.  
Music/Voice Acting: This has got to be one of my favourite soundtracks in anime of all time. Each track compliments the movie extremely well and every single one of them is fantastically orchestrated. There is a lot of range in atmosphere in the soundtrack, from upbeat to suspenseful to solemn. It goes without saying the soundtrack is excellent and is used masterfully well.  
As far as the English Dub goes, I really have no complaints. It is the same cast as the original series, and so if you had no issues there, then you shouldn’t have any here. Each actor continues to compliment his or her respective role well. As far as standouts go, they would have to be Crispin Freeman as Kyon and Michelle Ruff as Yuki Nagato.  
Crispin brings something new to the table as Kyon, going beyond the usual snarky attitude he usually has. Michelle Ruff wasn’t necessarily impressive in the original series (though in her defense, her character didn’t really call for anything special), and when it came to portraying the new side of Yuki Nagoto, she really delivers. She doesn’t go crazy and change her voice drastically. Instead, she subtly adds an indescribable… meekness to her performance.  
So yeah. The music and the dub are both fantastic. 
Final comments: This movie will give fans of the original series the fangasm they were wishing for, and even those who didn’t like the series might find something to enjoy here. Does this make the original series worth watching? In many ways, yes, it does. It’s a well-written movie with a great use of tone, amazing presentation, and masterful production values. It goes without saying that The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya gets a high recommendation from me.  
That’s all for my review, folks! Feedback would be greatly appreciated, whether it be praise or criticism.

Ok, so this is my first review, so I'll just go over all the points and such. 
The story is a mess for me. There are way to many separate stories going on at once for me to stay interested in all of them. In the first few episodes we see the main story of the main character from the first overlord, a story involving an old lady and a dragon, a story with a general, a story of the kingdom's princess and royal guard, a story of lizard men, and a story of the MC's butler in town, which is just too much for me to be interested. There might actually be more and I forgot. I'm sure these stories are meant to meet as one giant story at the end of the show, but with only -- episodes, I feel it'll just be rushed. I'd say there are only - or - pairs of stories that have met and become one story so far, and it's already half way through the season! It's not that any one story is bad, but we don't have enough time in --, -- minute episodes to be invested in all of them, which is why I give the story a -. 
The art is nothing special as far as I can tell. Nothing to write home about, but I can't say it's awful. Get another generic isekai show and paste one of the characters into a frame of Overlord and I bet they'd fit right in. This one's a -. 
The sound, is also nothing special. The voice acting seems very typical to me for anime, which means girls are very high pitched and I forget how all of the characters sound after - minutes. -. 
Just like story, there are too many characters. We already know of all the floor guardians that MC has, but now add on - times as many characters and you have Overlord II. The guardians were already enough for me, if not too much, so this is ridiculous. Do they want us to remember every single character they introduce? Like I said in story, we can't be invested in all of them, especially in -- episodes, so this one's also a -. 
I don't particularly enjoy the show, but I do enjoy finding problems with shows, which is why I've watched - episodes of it. The only big problems of this anime that can keep someone from enjoying it are that there are too many stories to be focused on, and it being so generic. We've been brought into another world far too many times and the genre should be dying by now. The spin for Overlord was that the MC was brought into another world, from another world within a video game, but that was the intro of the series in the first season. Now it's just a fantasy anime  with too many characters and an MC who is knows about Japan. This is a -. 
So, that's it. Another generic Isekai anime, except it has - stories. In total, it gets a -. 
Update-Episode --Spoilers:  
Episode - was unbelievably stale for me. We see this sword fight between general guy and determined knight for no reason other than to fight. We've barely seen this knight, so the anime goes and says that this would be the perfect time to dump this exposition on you, hurray. Then, he goes back indoors and sees the obvious villain, who talks smack about the princess, whom knight probably loves, doing all these great things for the kingdom, but he doesn't say why it's a bad thing for him. Yeah, the princess is helping the poor, but why are you against that? It might be medieval-ish times, but that makes little sense. Ok, now that's over, and we see knight, princess, and other princess like person along with another guard like person talk for - minutes about something be barely know about, because that's the definition of entertaining.  
Now, we are brought to the mansion with Old butler, Maid, and Slave. Men come in saying that taking slaves from their owner is illegal, so Maid says to MC that Old butler is a traitor. What? Why?  
Now we are more than half way through the season and still, we haven't seen more of the dragon and old women story, or the wimpy master swordsman story. Plus, what ever happened to MC's plan to spread his name to find more players trapped in that world? Instead of focusing in on this unresolved issue, the anime has given us - more issues to worry about. Who's that asshole who hates the poor? What was the princess talking about? Who is the dragon? what will master swordsman do now? What will Butler do now about the slave? What will the lizard men do, now that they're under Nazarick rule? Why was it important to know that knight was an orphan? Why does everyone who isn't a ""good guy"" immediately start acting like an unnecessary villain?

These days it goes against the grain for a person to rip on a cult classic. 
Allow me to do just that, write a review that'll do this series justice. 
Art -/--:  
Severely dated, by today standards this series comes off immediately as an eyesore. Absolutely pathetic by the --s animation criteria. This series came out around the time of the VHS era, the time when animation was purely hand drawn and devoid of any graphical rendering from CGI. I am a sap for smooth hand drawn animation and I can sympathise if the series cannot deliver those moments all the time, since that demands painful labours and a creative knack for animation per se. But Doraemon was lackadaisical from start to finish, not a single moment throughout the ---- episodes when I thought there was a redeeming scene that might salvage this utter disaster area, animation-wise. 
Sound -/--:  
Mediocre in every possible sense. I have no gripe on the sound effects since they're par for the course. The voice acting feels forced, as if the VOs just treated this like a run of the mill kid show and phoned in their run of the mill performance. The OP song is cringe worthy to the point of obsession-inducing but that is my personal beef. 
Character -/--:  
The show is laden with characters with the most cliche tropes you can possibly imagine: The challenged protagonist, the posh snub, the aggressive macho, the bland cute girl,... Notice the way I didn't go into further description of these certain character about their traits and background because there wasn't any to speak of. 
Story -/--: 
The story revolves around this spineless - year-old who was accompanied by a sentient robot from the future and his daily struggles with his life and peers. The robot was sent back to him with a view to helping him cope with his challenges and hardships as well as shaping him into a functional unit of society. Now the series did try to get a little creative by throwing in these futuristic devices which the characters capitalise for their own means, ultimately resulting in hilarity by the end of every episode. Unfortunately I cannot overlook the fact that the plot for this series straight up refused to develop into any particular direction and as a result, this became a major grind for me. After the --th episode I immediately realised what kind of show I was getting into.  
Enjoyment -/--: 
Again I must address the fact that character progression is non-existent in this series, too was any twists and coup de theatre that I was desperate praying for towards the end of doraemon. Perhaps this might get immensely more interesting were all of the hubbub being carried out just simply a figment of the protagonists's rich imagination, but then again this is not those kind of shows. 
Overall -/--: 
Doraemon is amongst the most insipid, trying series out there. I don't get how this is hailed as the embodiment of many people's childhood and such. Why can't your people's childhood be something a little more tasteful like Legend of The Galactic Heroes, or Neon Genesis Evangelion? 
Doraemon is overrated trash, avoid it like a plague.

even though I'm not finishing the anime I think I should do a little review of it 
(sorry my bad english i'm brazilian lol) 
Dr.Stone is a short anime with only -- episodes, but even so he can be quite pretentious and fun to watch, he mixes elements in what happened in real life and mixes in anime events. 
the protagonist is very focused on his goal, the funny moments are hilarious, the art just let me down, the art is a little ugly, and mostly girl's faces are a bit weird

K-On! Who doesn't like cute girls having fun with their buds. 
This review covers K-On!, and its sequel K-On!! 
Overall: - 
K-On! is an anime I had thought everyone watched. I was ready to jump right into it and love it. I did love it. Although it took me a long time to watch through, it was always nice to sit back and watch. K-On! is very easygoing and carefree. There's not much, if any, drama throughout the series. That being said, plot is pretty much non-existent, which doesn't matter too much in this slice-of-life. The music is phenomenal. I would recommend that everyone watch K-On!, at least season -, at some point in their weeb career. 
Story: - 
K-On! is an anime without a real overarching plot, and that really works for it. So if you don't mind not having an end goal in an anime, it works for you as well. If you're looking for deep plot and story, this isn't the anime. 
K-On! basically covers the life of highschooler Yui Hirasawa, as well as her club/band mates. Very simple premise, girl joins a club and does things. The story is very basic, but it leaves a lot of room to be creative. At the same time, it's not anything that hasn't been seen before. It's just another slice of life story. 
Art: - 
The art is definitely good. If you need a studio to draw cute girls, KyoAni is your studio. Only time I ever saw something I didn't like, was a performance in S-. Just looked weird, but I digress. K-On is still pretty. 
Sound: -- 
K-On! is about a band. A band makes music. Music is sound. Thankfully, Houkago Tea Time, the Keion club's band name, makes good music. All vocals are performed by the girls' voice actors, and most of the music are original songs written for the show. From Fuwa Fuwa Time to Ballpoint Pen to U&I, the songs are great. 
Sticking with that, the OPs and EDs for the series are all songs by Houkago Tea Time. K-On!'s opening and ending are Cagayake! GIRLS and Don't Say Lazy, respectively. K-On!!'s first OP and ED are GO! GO! MANIAC and Listen!!, and the second OP and ED are Utauyo!! MIRACLE and NO, Thank You. All songs are wonderful. 
Character: - 
K-On!'s characters are all sweet and young high school girls. The moe is strong in this anime. There are quite a few archetypal characters. The loud clumsy one, the loud tomboyish one, the quiet scared one, the quiet airhead, and the one that tries too hard to be taken seriously. That being said, the girls of K-On! are still wonderfully done. The problem being, with drama in the plot, there is nowhere for development to take place. Nothing changes within the characters throughout the series. 
Enjoyment: - 
K-On! is a lot of fun to watch. It sticks to the cute-girls-doing-stuff format, and does it right. There's not a dull moment throughout the series. Only problem is that it gets a bit repetitive.

Let's get down with the review. 
-Keitaro got a tan. 
-Keitaro finally got into Tokyo U, but the rest of the episode is spent on the girls locating him just to tell him that. 
-There's an alternate dark side Shinobu. 
-At the waterfall scene both Naru and Nyamo had to change into leaf clothes after their shirts had been soaked with water but few scenes later Nyamo changes back into her normal clothes while Naru is still in leaf clothing. Okay. 
-The scene at the end is an important event, as it is an important progress for both Naru and Keitaro's relationship. Might as well be saying that this whole episode is worth it just for that scene. Even Love Hina Again will reference to this scene. 
The audience would not miss anything by skipping this out but the confession scene at the end still looks pretty important in preparation for Love Hina Again.

- The Story - 
As is expected, the story of this season of KonoSuba is kinda bland. It's predictable, however the saving grace that keeps you watching is all the other stuff like... 
- The Art - 
The fluidity of the animation and how it flows is great, same with all the color choices, I'm appreciative of the non grays. However good art can be amplified and complimented by... 
- The Sound - 
Rie Takahashi, Jun Fukushima, Sora Amamiya, Ai Kayano, Yui Horie and Ayaka Suwa are all bloody fantastic VA's who take whatever bits of comedy that would be poor or good under someone else and elevate it to some sort of god level. The VA's also help develop something else very important... 
- The Characters - 
This honestly could tie into the sound a lot, because if you didn't know some of the most character telling gags where improved by the VA's. Despite this show having a source material it sometimes seems like completely different better characters. The characters are all pretty dang mean and unreasonable but they are endearing.

Seriously liked this until i saw the end :/, literally was -/-- then dropped to -/--... wish there was more of a continuation rather than just ending it like that. A -nd season would be great and will probably move this back up to a - almost --/--. The characters were great, especially Noami Evans (imo), sounds and art was also great. The idea of brainwashing taking time is great, as its not instant as others for example Gakuen Saimin Reido, this idea I like very much. To sum it all up, was great then turned bad, needs a -nd season

Zero has Charisma 
A magnificent masterpiece, yes, that probably sums up this whole series.  
Let's get straight to the point. This is an amazing series that anyone who has even the slightest bit of interest in anime has to watch. A milestone that has to be reached.  
The story line is Amazing, a perfect scenario, really well implemented. When I read the synopsis for this, I thought that the scenario sounded shallow, something that's been done again and again. But in Code Geass, it's been done beautifully. A simple plot, rebelling against a bad ruler, around this plot, a magnificent story has been built. 
Code Geass will make you admire, praise, love and then absolutely hate Lelouch (Euphemia, I love you). Lelouch is one of the best protagonists the world has seen. I mean he isn't the most Favorited character on MAL for nothing. 
Code Geass is already better that most shows in many ways. It has a clear direction, a capable (really capable) protagonist, good visuals (stunning), and probably one of the best story-lines.  
Code Geass changed my mindset about Mecha shows for me, it might change yours too. My review has absolutely no spoilers. Just go enjoy the show. Then drop me a comment if you liked it too. 
Peace out!

""Time might separate us some day. But, even still, until then, let's stay together."" -Hotaru Takegawa 
Time is cruel. Time is responsible for the summers that come and go, for the leaves in autumn that shrivel and fall to the ground at the mercy of the next toddler looking to create satisfying crunching sounds, for the long and cold winters.  
You come to love the smell of rain in the spring or the cool breeze of a summer night and then poof. It's gone.  
Much like a fleeting summer's day, the main characters in Hotarubi no Mori e are bound by the chains of time. He cannot leave the forest for fear of being touched by a human and she cannot see him until three seasons have passed and summer comes again. And so, the two spend time together when they can, and as she grows up with him she realizes there will come a day when time will yet again become their enemy. 
Their time together is short, meaningful and ultimately bittersweet. Much like the anime itself.  
Hotarubi no Mori e is a beautiful movie that takes the idea of forbidden love, a topic that has been overly done and worn out by bad soap-opera themed dramas, and remakes the idea in an elegant, refreshing manner. Much of the brilliance in this anime can be accredited to the captivating character and background designs as well as the honesty that shines through in the writing. The anime pulls us viewers in with dramatic music and writing while keeping everything light and down-to-earth. And it does all of this in a mere -- minutes.  
Forbidden love, playful love, intense love, a love that is not love. With all of these takes on love, can we really be sure of what love is? Simply put, love is a universal... well, for lack of a better word, thing.  
Nobody really knows what love is but everyone has their own interpretation of the word. Plato once said, ""at the touch of love, everyone is a poet"". And it's true. The concept of love is incredibly popular and you can probably find more pieces of literature or entertainment that center around love than any other genre. This anime specifically has taken the idea of a physical love and completely thrown it out of the window, all the while proving with gusto that love doesn't have to be physical to be just as emotionally impacting.  
You see, the anime focuses on the more important ideas about love that maybe we've all kind of forgotten.  
Like the happiness you feel when you're near them.  
Like the first time you saw them laugh.  
Like when it's suffocating to be with them because you don't know what to do or say.  
Hotarubi no mori e gracefully weaves these elements into a heartbreaking tale of a first love. Sure, it's lighthearted and even a little fun, but a love founded on emotions is the heaviest burden you can imagine.  
As stated before, the art this anime is nothing short of breath-taking. The designers definitely knew what they were doing when it came to setting the mood with soft pastel colors or adding bursts of colors to enhance a scene. Although it wasn't exactly memorable, the art did help to add an extra element of beauty. Similarly, the soundtrack to this anime was also very fitting and nice. Especially the ending song, ""Natsu wo Miteita"" (I saw summer) which had the feel of summer that is longed for but will never return. The art and sound really worked together well with what was happening on screen. Everything fit together perfectly like puzzle pieces.  
To end this review, I will rebound back to the very beginning and touch upon the subject of love again with our two main characters Hotaru and Gin. What makes this anime so special, what makes it stand out from all of the others that claim to give you the true meaning of love is that it's believable and honest, despite having the supernatural theme of spirits. Despite their wishes, the two are bound by circumstances that are out of their control.  
They cannot touch.  
They cannot see each other outside of the forest.  
They are reunited in the summer and are separated in the fall, over and over again.  
And against all odds, they try their best to maintain the connection they've built through years of playing in the grassy fields, spending time by the lake on a warm summer night talking in hushed voices or confiding in one another under the light of the fireflies -- a connection stronger than any kind of physical love can ever provide.  
The ending may come as a shock to you. Having read the premise, and a few other stories with similar plots, it didn't come as a shock to me. And although I knew it was coming, I couldn't stop myself from crying when it did. This anime was touching and nostalgic. I know it was good because I was left with an empty feeling after watching it -- like the feeling of longing after something that time has already taken away.  
Like the ever-changing seasons, this anime will pull you in, get you attached to the characters, make you love it and then...poof. It'll end.

Maquia is a disappointment. If you enjoyed the movie, by all means go ahead and enjoy it - but to me it lacks the space to really drive its narrative and themes home, and as a result characters who should be interesting and compelling come off one dimensional and occasionally annoying as the thematic resolution falls flat. First things foremost, though: I have absolutely nothing against Mari Okada or her work on this project. She has her fair share of haters and her style is not always my thing, but she does a fantastic job with what she is given on this project. Thanks to P.A. Works, Maquia sports a visual flavor and pace that the shows she wrote just never had, and it allows Okada to try her hand at a larger scope than she's ever dealt with. 
My first, second, and third problems with this movie can be boiled down to a single word: time. There's just not enough. I'm sorry, you cannot spin this huge generation-spanning epic starring an ageless lead, dissecting her relationship with the humans around her who age and die before her eyes, and then cram it into barely --- minutes. When Maquia visits Ariel in the film's epilogue, a moment that should feel poignant and heavy with the weight of almost a century of events leaves little to no impact. This needed likely a full cour to really get the meat out of the story - and get this! If this had been in the form of a - or --cour TV anime, I probably would have loved it. Drum up the art and animation quality a bit more, sink your teeth in more to Maquia's narrative, and tell the whole story so you can actually feel the time pass. That way the audience can actually invest in the characters, most of all Maquia herself, and you can pursue some semblance of a resolution. Without time, you have nothing with which to hammer home your main themes, and everything you've built falls apart. If you can use your imagination to fill the years-long gaps in the narrative, power to ya, but the film simply does not do enough on its own to convince me of its thematic or character resolutions. 
Again: there are legitimate moments of pure inspiration here. -- year old Maquia sobbing trying to figure out breastfeeding was probably the most moving moment of the whole film, and the final scene was something else (though should the climax of a movie this big have been better? who knows). Okada plays with her motifs in a refreshingly powerful way, and there is clearly thought behind the development of theme ideas as the movie progresses. Maquia just doesn’t have the space to take them all the way. 
P.A. Works, or Mari Okada herself, or whoever, made the (wrong) decision that this story was best told in movie format and attempted to recount over ninety years in under two hours. Yes, a large chunk of that time is tacked on in the epilogue, but the main plot covers over two decades of time - still not enough in my opinion, but way too much to be squished into the total runtime of an eight minute short.

I was only able to watch - out of the -- episodes of this anime, partly because my eyes glazed over as this anime did another explanation of some rule or reference and gave a mini wiki page about it and partly because I don't want to. Some of you may call this inaccurate, I call it efficient.  
The plot is weak at best. - Kids get sucked into a wormhole and end up in some rpg type world where races and things of all sorts duel each other for supplies, goods, people and clan rights(which all gets explained in a monologue). They meet fan-service rabbit and join her recently destroyed clan that has nothing but starving kids. They lost everything in a forced duel with bad people (no explanation here) and now are going rebuild and fight the bad people using the three kids that somehow got there. The general premise is overly complicated as before each new thing they introduce, they go through a monologue: Here is mushroom kingdom, the inhabitants are the cybermen, otaku, and spartans, don't worry though there is a natural light barrier that keeps the light out and otaku happy, also blahblahblah..  
The over-the-top details however aren't as bad as the details that are left out and these details are the important story line ones. Both parties need to accept the duel before it is started. However the bad people can challenge us and take all our stuff even though we never gave consent.~no explanation~ (screw the rules, I have money). The bad guys have a name but we don't know what they really look like or the reason why they did this action. 
It also doesn't make sense why the three kids like each-other and like the fan-service rabbit and her flea-bitten kids. The - second back story for each of them implies that all of the three are lonely but that makes sense because one is a control freak, one is a sadist, and the last only talks to animals. Now for some reason now that they are in a new world, they are social butterflies that do good for other people. They could go with the new world, new person path but they don't change personalities when it comes to interactions with people outside their clan. Why does the male lead wear earphones that aren't connected to anything? Are they earmuffs or is he secretly listening to Beiber or secret orders from Kim Jong Un? So many important questions go unanswered in this anime. 
When it comes to the art it makes Dragon Ball Z look like it came out last year. The music and sounds they play have little to no correlation to the anime and its as if the video and audio department were communicating through a pasta noodle that broke in the middle. The OP is about being forced into a imprisoning world and destroying that world but the three kids were gods in their back-story worlds. The characters and their personalities make no sense nor are they consistent and are molded to the scene by the convenience of the author. 
The light and dark in this anime are poorly balanced and this is easily explained in the scene where the main characters joke about the sexual use of the fan-service rabbit then when another character proclaims his lust the tone went from joking about sex to chauvinistic men-are-pigs attitude. It's almost as if the anime tried to pander to all ages but its too dark for children and its too childish for adults.  
I watched this anime all the way to the -th episode because I like giving anime a chance to surprise me, even if it starts off poorly, with something innovative or good. The only thing that has surprised me about this anime is how I've lasted through the -th episode without melting my brain

“Knowledge is power. Information is power. The secreting or hoarding of knowledge or information may be an act of tyranny camouflaged as humility” - Robin Morgan. 
War indeed can be viewed as an inescapable and integral aspect of human culture. Sources claim --,--- wars have taken place between ---- BC and the late --th century, costing -.- billion lives, leaving only --- years of peace, but one dynamic concept of war has always been the tools used to wage it. We’ve seen the early man start with stones and clubs to advance to swords and with the discovery of gunpowder, bullets have also come into the fray, and the deadly nuclear and atomic warfare have also taken flight. The latest addition to this devastation inflicting family is information technology, but does this seemingly docile and easily accessible piece of technology be considered the most deadly weapon man has ever created? 
The second season of Jormungand, sub-named ‘Perfect Order’ comes with some changes in plot devices as the arms dealing takes a back seat in place of informational warfare. We are introduced to the fact that Koko has some sort of plan in the making as we see her send several rockets into space with the viewer kept completely in the dark as to what could be the reason for this. Although not a mystery series, the way the plot and secrets nicely unfolds is both smart and entertaining at the same time. 
Unlike the first season, intelligence agencies such as the CIA play a bigger role in the story. Viewers kept in the dark as to Koko’s plans are smartly inserted into the shoes of intelligence agencies as they try to discover what it is she is up to, this somewhat different approach is a welcome addition as it requires a bit of intuition from the viewer to keep up with the story unlike most series that just require you to simply look at the screen and diffuse any useless information that comes your way. The prequel was never presented with an antagonist that seemed would be able to go toe to toe against Koko in terms of wit but the second season states a claim on this with the introduction of new characters such as Hex and George Black who definitely seem to have the potential to push Koko and her crew to the wall.  
Just as in the first season the series progresses in bi-episodic arcs, while this is a good strategy that helps the writer to focus completely on one aspect of the story, it also poses a problem of connection. Once one arc is over, the connection between the previous and the next arc is most of the time thread-thin. Only very brief conversations about the previous arc serves as the basis to connecting two story joints which can make the series seems a bit disjointed a times. Fortunately only being a -- episode show it manages not to suffer the long term effects of such a predicament as it poses serious problem to character growth. 
White fox have of course done a great job with the visuals, some nice notables was the studios use of shading, shadows were nicely placed in appropriate locations such as faces that depicted facial buildup of the characters and especially on the clothes. Some stressed emotions such as rage are also nicely conveyed by use of shading right under characters eyes. Being a show that depicted modern warfare it also consisted of mechanical parts such as vehicles and helicopters, the studio decided to use CGI to animate this. The CGI most of the times remains seamless with the surroundings and impressively a times we see mesh perfectly when interacting with hand drawn characters however those CGI elements that used a somewhat darker color tone seemed a bit sloppy and carried with it all that most anime fans resent of CGI animation. The second season also placed strong emphasis on location, as the team traveled to a large number of different cities around the world and white fox of course did not slack off on doing their research to make sure they capture a city’s scenery and populace accurately into the fray. 
The place where the second season seemed to outdo itself far more than the first was with its choices of soundtracks. The soundtrack of the first season was great and honestly it was really unexpected that it would be something that could be built upon, but regardless it was done and with brilliant execution if i may add. The soundtrack consists of tracks from the first season, remixes of those tracks as well instrumentals that spanned into several genres such as rock, rap and even electro. Insert songs were included that to my surprise even included some Indian and French tracks. 
In the first season Koko has always seemed one dimensional in her emotions, always reserving a cool, calm and collected demeanor, so it was with great joy that this mask of hers is cast away at certain places as we see a different side to her emotions; Fear, grief and rage are ultimately introduced into her character in certain places that went a long way in making her character seem ‘human’. The relationship between Koko and Jonah is also put to the test as their already seemingly weird unpronounced relationship is put under serious strain in some places and the overall decisions and actions they choose to take make up a big turning point in the show itself. 
One of the first departments the series decided to give attention to was with the development of side characters, an aspect that was left barely touched from the first season. We get to see the past of the remaining members such as Tojo, R and Wilee up to their meeting with Koko. Instead of the show simply showing an entire episode of a characters’ past, it approaches it smartly by interchanging events between the past and the present, this ensured both development and advancement of the story at the same time, a “killing two birds with one stone” strategy if you’d like to call it. The lack of development in the first season that would no doubt leave fans with either Koko, Jonah or Lehm as character favorites are immediately put at risk as characters such as Wilee are presented to us in such an entertaining manner that one has to re-think their plans of favorite character.  
While we do get to see the whole characters in the series finally developed and create a stronger connection to them emotionally, the end- result however was never built upon. A character immediately having their arcs completed are afterwards seemingly put back under the rock from which they were picked up from and revert to be nothing more than filling spaces as they once were. This blatant disregard and ignorance on the part of the writers will prove to be an extremely wasted potential as it was basically a great chance that opened new pathways and possibilities that the series could have and should have advanced in but never did. 
With a mere - months between the first and second season we didn’t see too many improvements to the overall series as a whole, but there are little improvements here and there as we see in the thickening plot and the music. The series does still harbor it’s set of entertaining gun fights that with the help of great animation from white fox will leave most audiences dazzled. 
As time moves on, man will continue to advance his science and technology, and with information warfare being his latest weapon, we have to wait and see what new toy we can make in future to better and effectively kill each another.

** I review for the - category as one segment because they correlate with each other ** 
***** 
*) The basic synopsis of the story is about the grown up Naruto, the same Naruto from the Anime of the same title ""Naruto"". 
*) It's about the progress of Naruto's life story, development, and his thorough background. 
*) Since Naruto in ""Naruto Shippuden"" is the grown up version of ""Naruto"", then his progress story is very deep and very thorough. 
*) So deep even that it overshadowed other characters within this series. 
***** 
*) Other supporting characters which have a lot of role and a lot of part during the ""Naruto"" first anime lost its role and play a very minor part in ""Naruto Shippuden"". 
*) Take a look at Neji for example. 
*) During the first ""Naruto"" he is one of the most active supporting character and offer a lot of role and part during the story arcs and many of the fights. 
*) But Neji's part in Naruto Shippuden"" becomes very insignificant and it is fairly to said that he has no major role at all during this series. 
*) The only significance his role has to offer is only in season -, the ""Kazekage Rescue"" arc. 
*) Other than that, his role just disappears. 
***** 
*) The sad thing is, Neji is not the only one who lost his role in this series. 
*) Other active supporting characters like Kiba, Rock Lee, and many others who were once very active during the first ""Naruto"", lost its significance in ""Shippuden"". 
*) They rarely make any appearance, even though they made an appearance in the series, their function is nothing more than just a ""figurine"" or ""cameo"" with no real action or involve in any fight. 
*) And even they involve in any fight, they only just involve in a few minutes tops. 
*) In other word, they become more and more un-important for this series. 
*) And I think it is such a big lost because during the first ""Naruto"", they offer much role during the story arcs and much action. 
*) The only way you could see them in action more than any other is through fillers, but then again, fillers never have any significance to the main chain of the story arc and are highly ""skip-able"". 
***** 
*) Now comes the really big question: If those characters become very insignificant, then which characters have the most highlight? 
*) Well duh, none other than Naruto himself. 
*) The main protagonist from the first ""Naruto"", which is Naruto, Kakashi, Sasuke, and Sakura have shifted to Naruto, Kakashi, Yamato (just - of them). 
*) Now the series focused heavily on those -, Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. 
*) They involve in almost EVERY fight, they involve in almost EVERY story arcs, etc. etc. 
***** 
*) If ""Naruto"" didn't have a vast cast of characters, the when the series focused heavily on - characters it wouldn't be a problem. 
*) But ""Naruto"" has a vast cast of characters. 
*) If such vastness of character cast is being narrowed down into just - characters, then other characters become a waste, which is very unfortunate and disappoints fans of the other characters. 
***** 
*) The first season (the Kazekage Rescue arc) has very much to offer. 
*) A lot of martial art ninja-thingy fights with very minimum intermezzo during the fights just for ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story telling"". 
*) But after that, it's all going down hill. 
*) Season - has a very slow story pacing, too much to talk and too much to discuss, less fighting, and it's the first season to focus heavily on the main - characters, Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. 
*) From thereon, the story focuses heavily on Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. 
*) And after season -, you will encounter a lot of repetitive talk discussing the same topic for over and over and over again. 
*) Such repetitive definitely destroy the pacing of the story into a very sloooooow pace. 
*) Why waste a lot of repetitive discussion while we could understand the essence of the story just from ONE TIME discussion? 
*) Waste of time, and definitely waste of episode numbers. 
*) No wonder ""Shippuden"" has ---+ episodes and still counting, nearing to no end. 
***** 
*) Another item that causes the pacing to be slow is too much prolix for any scene. 
*) For example, let say someone has a dying scene, and has a last word to his/ her dear ones. 
*) For the first - or - sentences (less then - minute), the last word and the dying scene was very emotional and endearing. 
*) But when the last word becomes a last ""speech"" that last for around - minutes of talk, then the scene becomes boring and becomes sloooooow, making us want to skip the scene and fast forward because after the first - or - sentences, the scene becomes ""oh enough already!"". 
***** 
*) The action is spectacular, even it offers a lot of ""coolness"" than the first ""Naruto"". 
*) But just like its predecessor, many of the fights being inserted with ""technical discussions"" to discuss the technique / jutsu being used, and/ or inserted with ""background story"" to discuss the characters past. 
*) Such insertion destroys the mood-o'-meter of the audience. 
*) Any fighting scene offers a very height of mood ""Excitement"". 
*) But any insertion of the ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story"" just throw a ""wet blanket"" to our ""fiery"" excitement mood into a sad or ""thinking"" mood. 
*) What worse is that sometime ""background story"" wastes - or - episodes. 
*) And even after the - or - episodes of ""background story"", still the characters tell the story AGAIN during any fight. 
*) It's an un-necessary repetitive for something that ""we get it"" from the first time. 
*) Still has the same problem with the mood-o'-meter as in the first ""Naruto"". 
***** 
*) Another similarity that ""Shippuden"" shares with the first ""Naruto"" is the endless fillers. 
*) Fillers, fillers, fillers, even during the main story arc, the still have the time to insert - or - episodes of fillers. 
*) Fillers have never been had any significance in the main chain of the saga/ story, so therefore skip-able. 
*) But with lots of lots of fillers (I lost count), we will have skip-able episodes and un-necessary additions to the series. 
***** 
*) As the story progressed, the fighting and the jutsu becomes more and more about trading magic attacks. 
*) It lost it souls as a ""Ninja"" and as a ""Martial Artist"". 
*) The magic just being called ""jutsu"" to make it sound like a ninja-thingy, but the essence is still ""magic"" fights and not a ""ninja-martial-art"" fights. 
***** 
*) With ---+ episodes and counting, nearing to no end, it seems that the creator of this series doesn't want for ""Naruto"" to end. 
*) Therefore, throughout the series, we will see A LOT of story branching that never before was a story. 
*) Story branching creates a very un-focused story and stray away from the basic story writing of ""stick to the main story"". 
*) For example SPOILER ALERT..... you will see the connection between Jiraiya and Pain. 
*) During the first ""Naruto"" and during the first few seasons of ""Shippuden"", there was never any story between Jiraiya and Pain. 
*) But when the character Pain becomes the center of main antagonist during the series, then the writer created a story connection to Jiraiya. 
*) This definitely de-rail and stray the character story ""Jiraiya"" from the story line that he already has.  
*) Jiraiya is not the only one, you will see many other characters that being de-rail-ed and strayed from the main story they already have. 
*) In some cases being added another story and added another, making the story becomes more branched and de-rail-ed and stray from the main story line. 
*) Thus causing watching ""Shippuden"" to be having no different experience than having the experience of watching a ""telenovela"" or ""Desperate Housewives"", with all the de-rail-ing, straying, branching story line, and keep adding up story line. 
***** 
*) The most notable de-rail-ing and straying story line is the de-rail-ing main story of Naruto's dream of becoming Hokage just like in the first ""Naruto"" AND the ""pursue Sasuke"" story line. 
*) The story becomes very de-rail-ed and becomes very stray from the ""dreaming to become Hokage"" and ""pursue Sasuke"", because in ALL of those seasons, you will note that you will meet A LOT of story branching and additions, thus the ""dreaming to become Hokage"" and ""pursue Sasuke"" become ""Lost its meaning"" by it self. 
*) Making the story just un-focused and never reach any real conclusion. 
***** 
*) Therefore, with such: 
+ Positive+ 
+ Cool action and (kinda) fast pace fighting in season -, season -, and season ""invasion of pain arc""; 
+ Fighting scenes are faster pace than the first ""Naruto"", but NOT in every season, only several seasons; 
+ Deep story line for the mature Naruto. 
- Negative - 
- Wasting much of the vast character's potential; 
- Too much focus on a very narrow main protagonist from a vast characters; 
- Repetitive story telling; 
- Inappropriate insertion of ""technical discussion"" and/ or ""background story"" during a fight that destroys our mood-o'-meter; 
- Sloooow pacing story line; 
- Stray away from its soul story as a ""ninja"" fighting; 
- Too much de-rail-ing, straying, and branching of the story just like telenovela. 
- Too much fillers, AGAIN. 
The grade falls at - for all the Story, Character, and Enjoyment because the Negatives out weights the Positives.

Noragami Aragoto ノラガミ Review 
Story (-/--) Very Good 
Noragami Aragoto takes too arcs from the manga and adapts them in -- episodes and as an anime only watcher I feel it was done very well from a pacing stand point. Only one episode really felt episodic and out of place but it wasn't a bad episode to say the least. Although the first arc felt more compelling than the second they both connected well when it came to Bishamon's character development, characterization and her relationship towards the MC. It left the ending of this season with a teaser of what's to come which I felt was a very good cliff hanger and I hope it get's a season - to continue it. 
Art and Animation (-/--) Very Good 
Bones did a very good job animating this season nothing mind blowing but it was still an eye candy to some extent. I do felt last season was animated a bit better but I guess that's only because of the final battle in season - that made me feel that way. Either way the art style and animation in the season was very good. 
Sound (-/--) Great 
The BGM, voice acting (in both JP and Dub although the JP was better the Dub wasn't bad the only voice who doesn't fit their character in the dub is the MC himself) and opening music are all great in this season. I started watching it in Sub but then moved over to Dub even though I'm not a fan of Yato's voice it didn't bother me enough to not watch it but it was enough to point out.  
Characters (-/--) Very Good 
More Specifically (-.--/--) Very Good+ 
The characters in this season are all very good, almost every character got very good character development and are more likable this time around vs back in season -.  
Enjoyment (-/--) Very Good 
My enjoyment was very good even though I started watching this anime when it first aired and I put it on hold and didn't finish it until now. I still enjoyed my time with this season and I feel I enjoyed it more binge watching it as I did the first. 
Overall (-/--) Very Good 
More Specifically (-.--/--) Very Good 
I felt Noragami Aragoto is a bit better than the first, I think it's a very good anime to binge watch like I said before and the pacing was well done. For them to cover to arcs in -- episodes and not make it feel rush I think is an accomplishment.

*Spoilers below, though I have not given away the villain's identity or the ending* 
The supernatural has captivated our imagination for generations. For all the horror that usually abounds these tropes, many storytellers use supernatural elements to comment on human nature. In the many titles focusing on zombie apocalypses, this is especially true. Rick and his merry band fight humanity at its worst throughout much of The Walking Dead. Joel and Ellie battle hunters and cannibals as they try to find the cure for the fungal zombie virus in The Last of Us. It fascinates us and horrifies us when we see what humanity is capable of to survive in a world that turns against them. Kabaneri tries to comment on the human condition, it really really tries. It’s too bad that it doesn’t get to that point until halfway through the season.  
Story: For at least ten years, humanity has been plagued by the unrelenting appetite of the Kabane, Kabaneri’s version of zombies. Kabane are portrayed as strong, mindless undead humans who can only be killed by piercing their glowing heart, a feat near impossible by normal methods. Most humans have found shelter in walled cities connected by railroads, though many of these “stations” have fallen to the Kabane over the years. The mysterious Prince Biba roams the countryside in his armed train killing many Kabane and the country’s elite find protection in the capital. Kabaneri begins at a peaceful station that is quickly overrun when a train carrying a hoard of Kabane breaches the gates. Ikoma, our green haired protagonist, is bitten in the ensuing chaos, but is able to stave off the infection by choking himself. The survivors flee in a train named the Koutetsujou, with Ikoma and Mumei allowed on with huge trepidation.   
And thus the title of the show is explained. Ikoma and Mumei are both Kabaneri, or people who have been bitten by Kabane but whose brains are still human. Kabaneri are inhumanly strong, but with that strength comes a price: they need blood to survive. The first few episodes are sprinkled with prejudice and distrust towards both Kabaneri despite their repeated help. This whole plot point quickly becomes tired and boring, with people welcoming Mumei one minute and decrying her the next. Ikoma is kept locked away for the most part, but many fear him. They are not fully accepted by the people until they save everyone again in episode four, and by then it’s been at least three solid episodes of distrust, prejudice. and even a coup on the train.  
The writers for this series take many liberties in the face of advancing the plot, usually coming up with idiotic ways for humanity to fuck itself over. In episode one, for instance, the guards for the gate into the city decide to lower the drawbridge for a fast moving, oncoming train (later revealed to have many Kabane on board) instead of waiting for the train to come to a complete stop. This of course jumpstarts the plot, but it puts into question how humanity has survived for so long when the guardians of the city can’t even perform basic checks on a train before letting it into the city proper.  
In spite of all this, as a survival story Kabaneri was fairly enjoyable. The battle against the black shadow was a marvel to look at visually and the music only added to the fight. But the shows’ hubris catches up with it and inexplicably the story tries to focus on the human condition instead. It is a badly done critique though, because the main villain is one dimensional and ridiculous and the whole thing spirals into a terribly done revenge plot instead. The villain's motivations are thin at best and the loyalty of his soldiers is laughable. The story tries to pin the emergence of the Kabane on the elites in the capital but even this is barely explored. The direction the plot decides to go is completely terrible. Remember what I said earlier about how the writers come up with bullshit reasons to advance the plot? It’s not a good critique on humanity when a crazy person is the one bringing all of the misery in the last few episodes. Tearing apart the rest of Kabaneri’s flimsy story means tearing apart the characters, so on we go.  
Characters: I’ll be blunt: I don’t like Mumei. Or Ikoma really. But Mumei’s character really irks me. She’s incredibly naïve and idiotic at the best of times. Her personality is constantly shifting: one minute she’s cute and smiley and the next she’s intense and frowning. She says or does something that doesn’t sit right with the people around her and doesn’t offer a logical explanation. She doesn’t listen to what the leader of the group tells her to do when they are on missions. She’s constantly thinking about how only the strong can survive, weak people should die, etc. etc. It’s amazing that these people actually like her. She doesn’t think badly of the villain ever, and even when he betrays her trust she still goes back to him. She knows he lied to her but she goes back. She trusts him to not do anything to her when she just witnessed a friend get fucked over by him. Yes, she’s only a girl, but it’s insane that she still trusts him after she saw him do. The rest of her plot is predictable, boring, and contrived. The villain proves that her badass characterization is moot, manipulates her, and eventually turns her against her friends. The fact that she’s responsible for the deaths of thousands of people doesn’t help my opinion of her.  
Ikoma is also frustrating at times, but not on the level of Mumei. He is the typical shounen protagonist: young, naïve, and mostly weak. His contribution to this world is a steel piecing projectile weapon. Most of the time he’s tagging after Mumei trying to make her a decent human being, which is almost impossible. His naivety is frustrating and as a character he really doesn’t add much to the story. He isn’t really necessary. He is only Mumei’s link to humanity and since I don’t care for Mumei at all, I really can’t care about Ikoma either. In the last few episodes her gets an appearance change (arguably to indicate that he is a badass now) and his character arc seemed to be going a a good direction. It's too bad the writers didn't have the balls to follow through with it.  
And then there’s The Villain. Until episode -, the only thing the audience knows about him is that he is Mumei’s “older brother” and that he is the one that has told her that only the strong should survive. This person is our antagonist and until episode - we have not seen him ever. This is terrible writing. At this point in the story I was convinced that the Kabane would continue to be the antagonists because who else could it possibly be? That guy Mumei talks about occasionally? No goddamn way. How could I get invested in an antagonist’s motives with only five episodes left of the series? How could I possibly care about this dude? Right from the beginning when he was introduced I knew he was an asshole. He kills people with a smile on his face. He’s cruel, manipulative, and callous. He treats his servants like expendable objects. He throws away a kabaneri like it’s nothing. He lies to Mumei and destroys an entire station, killing thousands, just to send a message to his father. And why? Why is he doing this? Because his father was mean to him when he was younger. Because his father didn’t care about him enough to try to save him. And so now, he has to go around and kill thousands of people just because he has daddy issues. It’s a ridiculous, tired motivation and the fact that this is the antagonist a zombie anime is going with is ridiculous. This guy manipulated a young impressionable girl who had just lost her mother and turned her into a kabaneri because he was angry with his dad. The fact that he has people that are still loyal to him is baffling. He’s throwing a humongous temper tantrum, but it’s not cute because he’s killing everyone instead of yelling at them. 
Animation and Sound: The animation is great. The composer is the same one that did Attack on Titan, so the soundtrack is wonderful. I could say that it sounds a little too much like AoT, but composers have their own style, so I can’t fault him for that. The voice acting is good for the most part. Yuki Kaji is distinctive as he always is for me, but it’s not distracting. Tasuku Hatanaka’s voice work for Ikoma is painful to listen to. He did good work on Ushio to Tora, but because his voice is so distinctive it felt like I was listening to Ushio talk about zombies for the entire show. It didn’t help that the second season of Ushio was airing at the same time.  
Kabaneri looked like a promising anime at the beginning, with a decent survival plot unfurling nicely. However, the story suddenly does a huge --- into a story that has no relevance to the one previously set up. In the end, all that’s left are the shambles of a promising story and a garbage pile of shitty characterization, contrived plot points, and terrible writing. It was good as a survival story, but it’s terrible as a revenge story. I’ll just play The Last of Us again next time.

As someone who has read the light novels (LN), all I have to say is....wow, and not in the good way. 
I've read the, and continue to follow,  the light novel and was quite excited when I found out it was going to be animated. That excitement disappeared quite quickly after I was - episodes in. Aside from the first episode (which quite thoroughly covered the first chapter), everything is rushed.  Obviously when you use up -- volumes **edit: - vols** worth of material and jam it into -- episodes its not going to look pretty (-- eps in reality cause ep - was chapter -). The overall effect this has on the show is that it feels like your typical, unremarkable series with specks of harem thrown in.  In all honesty, with -- episodes, they should have slowed the pace down and just went up until after the ""Roland"" arc. 
I wouldn't be stretching it if I said that non-LN readers wouldn't really understand what was going on.  I wouldn't not recommend this series unless youre a fans who has read the LNs. Even then, i'd still say its worth a watch only if you really want to see ""parts"" of the series animated. Don't expect too much though, because I was clearly disappointed.

The survival horror genre is a mess these days. A lot of game and film companies try to have unique ideas for a survivor horror tale and most of them are hit and miss. The original manga King Of Thorn was a surprise hit and while it didn't perfect the genre, it did leave an impression to manga readers with it's compelling characters, crazy storyline and moments of true tension. Now the animators at Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Freedom and Steamboy) release their film adaptation to King Of Thorn. Now before I go on, I never read the manga (I'm not really a huge fan of mangas) but I will try my best with details that were changed in the movie. 
The premise and ideas of King Of Thorn are incredibly unique but the problem is that the movie took a lot liberties with the material of the manga. They scrapped the backstories of the characters, the main antagonist Zeus did not appear in the movie and the ending was completely changed from the original story. For example in the manga, one survivor named Tim is a little boy who is mature and quite usable for the team but in the anime, he's a video game JRPG addict and HE'S COMPLETELY USELESS! These changes were just awful and really ruined the characters for me (minus the sisters though). We're talking about - people who must risk their own life to survive a place where thorns, a non-curable killer virus and monsters take over the place and what the writer did is scrap the emotional backstories of ALL characters. Also, important characters like Alice and Zeus were never used in the film since they did provide important story aspects in the original mangas. So yes, the changes to the characters and stories were inexcusable, they could have made this into a - hour anime film to provide us with emotional weight that these characters go through, character backstories and much story as possible. Overall, it makes the story convoluted as hell that it's too hard to appreciate the ideas that it offers for the viewers. 
The animation by Sunrise is hit and miss. When it shines, it's in the -D animation department. The detail is great, coloring and backgrounds look fluid look wonderful and the character models are nicely drawn well and on the miss, it's the -D CG animation. My god... Why? It looked horrible and the monsters in CG form looked like they popped out of a PS- game. Hell, the character models in CGi look very ridiculous. I think the reason for this is that Sunrise had a low budget to make this movie and they incorporated CG to save up some money for the marketing. Next time Sunrise, balance out the budget so that this doesn't happen again. For all my problems I have with this movie, does it make it awful? Of course not. There are a few positives I had with the movie. The sisters were handled very well in the movie and you do feel sorry for them for what they go thorugh and Kasumi goes through more hell than anyone can ever imagined. i also love the scenes with lots of tension and gore and the dubbing by Funimation was not that bad. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Kasumi giving that vulnerable side to the character and Patrick Seitz was convincing as Marco and the whole cast did a solid job on their perspective roles. Although the accents of each character can be laughably bad at some points. 
If you're interested in seeing this, you might like this one as I did cause to be fair, it offers some great relationship moments with the twin sisters, great moments of tension and a nice dub provided by Funimation. However if your a fan of the King Of Thorn mangas, be very cautious with this one as it changes everything about the mangas including the backstory of all characters. Therefore, King Of Thorn is an interesting anime film with great ideas but with a very sloppy execution.

I was honestly, truly looking forward to the new kekkai sensen season. My friend and I absolutely adored the first season. It had the right amount of craziness and enough plot to keep us going. Because of how great the first season was, we both went into this with high expectations. But this season... has been a train wreck. 
With only - episodes left, I have very little hope that there's going to be a truly satisfying ending. Seeing the preview for the next episode even further solidifies my feeling. 
The format has been that of an episodic anime, where something that happens in one episode doesn't really correlate with another. Nothing connects. There's very little actual story going on. We're getting GREAT episodes that focus on one character at a time where we learn about a specific character, but that's all Beyond has going for it.  
There's nothing building up. No story other than ""yeah crazy shit is happening again"". We're being introduced to new characters that I can't feel anything for because, again, we only focus on them for like one episode and that's it. 
For the most part, Kekkai Sensen and Beyond is nice if you're wanting a snapshot of one of the main cast's day in everyday life. But you're also missing very little if you choose to skip around.

When I left my home and mom two years ago, I (along with Pikachu) venture into the deep realms of the anime territory. Alienated towards the otaku culture, I felt depressed looking for a war anime that can suit my tastes; Grave of the Fireflies was not enough for me. I entered into a forest one night. Night came and none appeared before me. I ate all my Kitkats by then. Hungry, I killed Pikachu and devoured its tender meat over a campfire. I continued journeying, but my vision blurred; everything around me turns misty and foggy. I hear the flapping of the wings and the rustle of the trees. The forest was laughing at me. Losing hope, I fell down to the mud. Writhing in agony, I looked towards the dark night sky. I called up to the heavens, “Save me, God. Save me from this despair.” 
God said, “Okie dokey, dude. Check out this anime. It’s called Sora no Woto. You’ll love it; it’s pretty radical, man!” 
Today, I am back at home well-fed. My mom cried when I told her Pikachu was killed by the characters from K-On!. Nevertheless, the miracle known as Sora no Woto made me ponder about the future of war animes. 
A few weeks ago, Professor Oak gave me Charmander along a copy of Strike Witches. He boasted, “It’s uncensored. Consider it a rite of passage.” He patted me on the shoulder, winking. I had never heard of Strike Witches until the professor told me so. Judging from the synopsis, it looked like a war anime. I went into the MyAnimeList database, reading the synopsis and the reviews; many people likened this work to Sora no Woto, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs awarded this work for cultural excellence, and God told me to review works through Fox News before that. I decided to watch this work and review the work. 
Strike Witches is set in an alternate World War II setting, specifically the Battle of Britain. Considered one of the toughest battles in World War II history, the Battle of Britain setting has the potential to set up thought-provoking characters and themes. It can make us ponder about the effects of the appeasement effort led by Neville Chamberlain, war in different people’s perspectives, shell shock, and more. Sora no Woto might actually lose to the work’s possible themes; its themes are environmental, cultural, and anti-war by nature, criticizing warmongers for making the world it is today. Consider Strike Witches’s setting for a minute. Wouldn’t this be a fascinating show for everyone to watch? 
I remembered Professor Oak’s winking. As I began to watch, I realized why he winked. Oh dear, I’m seeing young girls’ reproductive organs and underwear for no apparent reason except Freudian imaginations. The alternate history made little sense whatsoever. This did not bode well. 
In this alternate historical setting, Japan worked with the Allies and stationed their troops at London. The Neurois, aka the Nazis, were unknown sentient creatures that kept blasting away Europe for no particular reason. Their aircrafts looked starkly similar to US stealth fighters. The Allies were stumped, losing all of Europe except England. How could anyone damage the aircrafts when they clearly had force fields protecting them? 
Japan’s answer: girls with jetpacks and basic weaponry. 
Strike Witches’s setting combined the Battle of Britain, mecha logic, and the mahou shoujo genre so weirdly it made little sense. Questionable aspects of how things worked were never answered throughout the course of this anime. 
As I began to write this review, God cried out through Hannity’s mouth, “What about the characters? This show is all about the characters just like Sora no Woto is!” 
What made Sora no Woto’s characters so special was that they felt necessary in contributing the story and the themes. Strike Witches’s characters could go into that direction, but most of the times want to, you know, go in an upper direction. 
Take Lynette, one of the few likable characters in the work. When she was introduced in the work, she was shown as a shy girl character; a good comparison would be a girly version of Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion. In the end of the episode, she began to open up towards Miyafuji by squishing her to death; suffocating and dying between Lynette’s cleavage sounded like a nice way to die, but it was no example of good storytelling. 
Gertrud Barkhorn and the two white-haired girls are the only characters to go completely into characterization. The episode with Barkhorn has some fantastic exposition added in; people can understand her mindset more clearly. The two white-haired girls have interesting stories as well. 
Everyone else feels stale. All we really know from Sakamoto Mio is that she laughs like Jack from The Shining and does whatever cos a pirate is free. Perrine is a stalker of Mio. Erica is a clumsy ace pilot. Miyafuji can heal. Francesca is Ed from Cowboy Bebop. There isn’t many characteristics that make these characters involving or realistic; they are just there. Cardboard boxes make better characters than these people. 
Like Sora no Woto, it is somewhat episodic. Most of the plot involves the fascinating premise of “cute girls doing cute things”. A particular episode involved about underwear. Very few of them are memorable. When the show adds tension, it does not feel tense; it looks plain silly. The dramatic story and conclusion emerges at the end. Predictable and silly, the conclusion to the work does not pay off well; things get solved with a deus ex machina. There is also a cliffhanger, pointing people to watch Strike Witches -. 
No thanks, Gonzo. I might watch it someday, but it’s not due to your cliffhanger. 
I returned the set to Professor Oak and yawned. I do not think this work was the worst work I’ve seen. It did not piss me off a lot; though, I ate a boiled skewed Charmander on a satay stick in the end because of how bored I was. There are things I disliked -- the fanservice, the wasted potential, the unfunny side characters. However, they don’t cause me to hate this work. Instead, I just thought this work as really average; it did not offend me at all. I was just really bored. 
There are definitely people who loved it; some may say it is thought-provoking, maybe even more against Sora no Woto. I don’t see it that way nor do I think the endorsement by the government is needed. Say all you want, but I see it as a government-endorsed loli pantsu anime with girls on jetpacks beating up Nazis. It’s no Sora no Woto, that’s for sure. I suppose it can be entertaining to people -- it is possible that I have no soul. As a work of artistic and cultural achievement, now that’s a great joke to laugh about.

This series is like if the world would ever one day reach Judgment Day, and God brings down the does-it-all device to judge humans the way He does best: Bless the heavenly and persecute the devils with an all-Godly item. And bear in mind, it also goes the long route to showing its strength at gore every step of the way. 
And that my friends, is Dorei-ku The Animation, based on the manga Dorei-ku: Boku to ---nin no Dorei (or -- Slaves and Me), which explicitly tells the stories of -- different people who became slaves, each with their own idiosyncrasies and knacks at their thinking. To be fair, the anime showcased the entire short manga series written by Hiroto Ooishi, and I have to say that while this is a fresh take on the drama-psycho genre, and generally with the manga is better than the anime due to its pacing and people-relevancy chapters that align with the structure of the overall setting, the anime is also a largely toned-down version of it due to the manga being able to portray scenes that just cannot be replicated in anime or if it did get approved, it will only be censored heavily. 
So, we follow Eiya Arakawa, a titular normal girl whom was doing her stuff when one day she found this insane teeth-like device called the SCM (or Slave Control Method), a device that looks plain-looking, until the gist of the device shows, and opens up the world to slavery. Then, another character comes along (Yuuga Ohta) and claims that he doesn’t have much to do in his college life, so a collab with one of his friends also inferred him into the SCM world, and like Eiya, discovered its abilities and attempts the crazy plan to acquire slaves just for fun, until he was imprisoned by other masters and had Eiya (as the gamemaster in disguise in a game) to free him and from there, free others from this insane activity of a helm. And so, with the game of wits, brain-thinking and mental power, the journey to finding out the true source and value of the SCMs ensue. 
First off, Dorei-ku is more than just the typical drama-psychological anime. Yes, it can’t quite compare to better shows like Psycho-Pass, but as a start, it shows promise…until the realization that because of greed and power, many people became masters and slaves (hence the term -- slaves) that are always targeted by master SCM wielders and the endless duels that happen from time to time. The elephant in the room is that the entire SCM sequence repeats in many characters’ flashbacks, though their coincidence with the SCM is the same-old boring story and it only gets better when the SCMs are used to duel. Speaking of the SCMs, there’s - types: the normal master, slave and Judgment SCM (the king of the SCMs where with a snap of the finger, immediately rescinds the enemy into slavery), all with their different levels of difficulty and mind-playing between people. 
The characters here…let’s just say that they exist for as much as an episode, then they are relegated to slavery after that (but not MCs Eiya and Ohta as they need to move along the plotlines). It’s easy to see why they are underdeveloped or developing once their SCM statuses are either demoted or promoted respectively, because as much as they are human beings, nothing will serve them good if they are slaves that follow the masters’ orders. The exposition from the manga provides a detailed analysis of the individual people that come into contact with the SCM, be it their experiences of hatred, greed and the such, but the anime either just downplayed or missed the exposition, for what reasons I’m not able to decipher. 
The art and animation, when it comes to comparisons, I did state that this is quite literally the Ousama Game of ----, but Dorei-ku’s overall presentation is better than the latter for reasons that people can nitpick about and state similar and different things. This is one of the few anime that has a cross-collaboration project between studios, in this case, TNK (the makers of the horrendous School Days) and Zero-G (Tsugumomo, this season’s Nil Admirari), so if you know the studios’ traits, it’s easy to see why (but if not I’m just nutshell it: TNK on working out the source material and giving it the ‘false’ edgy feels while Zero-G works on animation). Overall presentation looks good, but at times can be heavily panned for the insane amount of blood and gore, something which I never have a liking for. 
The music does do a good representation of the entire series, and while (yes), the songs are decent and portray the world of the series, there’s nothing that could be further redeeming from the truth. It’s a perfect fit for the series, but unappealing on its own. 
So, is Dorei-ku a good watch? Absolutely not, yada yada. If the characters are here to turn you off then please skip this, otherwise it’s only a decent yet mediocre watch, not a great representation of the manga original source though. And as a manga reader, I don’t feel disappointed either, because it lost steam in the process and became yet just another generic psycho-drama adaptation. In the end, Dorei-ku is a dime a dozen, and you can better spend your time elsewhere.

My experience of this anime can be summed up by the word ""meh"". I went into it hoping for a nice twist on the seven deadly sins being the good guys, and some awesome fight scenes, and ended up sorely disappointed. Sure, the characters are known by their sins, but rather than be actual embodiments of said sins, they were simply granted them as derogatory titles, so they fail to stand out as shounen manga characters in that department. 
The characters don't undergo any sort of development across the series, and for the most part are bland and boring. Ban is pretty fun because of his aloof yet silly attitude, and the rest have some decent humor, but this is definitely not a high point of the series. 
The combat was especially mediocre. The fights only ever focus on Meliodas and Ban --% of the time, with the rest of the sins just acting as accessories. This is especially frustrating after so many of them are hyped up as 'the strongest of the deadly sins', or 'the prince of fairies'. I particularly was looking forward to Diane kicking ass, but we only ever really get one awesome moment out of her when she punches through a supposedly unbreakable barrier. The rest of the time she's either sleeping, -- miles away, or has a hole punched through her chest and has to act as a damsel in distress. Ugh. 
We do get a couple of good battles in, but the majority only last a couple of seconds, due to the characters' (see: Meliodas and Ban's) overpoweredness. Only two or three fights really give any true sense of danger, and one of them was ruined for me by how easily Diane went down. But that's just me. 
I kept watching because I expected a more even playing field eventually, with all of the sins being equally capable, but that unfortunately never happens. Meliodas and Ban are, throughout the anime, just complete male power fantasies, while the rest of the crew just gets swept under the rug.  
I don't hate this anime, but I don't recommend it. It's not bad, just decent, and really not worth your time. It lacks any aspect that really stands out, and ultimately just falls flat, lost amidst a sea of better, more entertaining shounen anime.

I saw the first episode of Supernatural Animation, and it was nothing but a chineese stupidity. In the end of the animation, you can hear the song of Kansas- Carry on my wayward son, executed by an unknown and probably untalented artist.. he literally killed this wonderful song. I m a big fan of Supernatural and i think this animation serie is pointless.. It underestimates the tv serie Supernatural , and its horrible. Personally i will stick @ tv series Supernatural which i watch it for years... i reccomend you to do the same..

I really don't know where to start with this review or end.  It's not even fitting.  I don't understand how the other reviewer gave it such a commendable response.  But it really doesn't deserve it.  There are Japanese films that can fall very easily into this genre and they are far more commendable.  A guy gets hired, mainly by rejected men or something---or he just takes it upon himself and he basically runs around raping women who seem to love it after ward. 
It makes you question the morality of a society and the people who came up with it.  If I take it as a feminist that I am, I'm utterly offended.  If I take it as tongue-in-cheek nonsense...well it's...fitting.  Basically this story was developed to appeal to the adult male audience (no not the pubescent) so they can start reading mangas.   I don't really think adult males need such story concepts in order to get into reading mangas.  Berserk is a good example of good story with extreme themes.    
In any event, as a manga it was a bomb---so it boggles my mind why it was turned into a mini-anime.   
As a short analysis of each rated part of the anime, it's not going to be pleasant. 
Story---there actually is a meaning as to why the guy does what he does.  You just have to wonder how rape is a plausible teaching lesson.  Is the story rich and developed and grasping...no---there's just violence and misogynistic behavior towards women.   
Art---it's like that --s style art from like yaoi hentai with the same style of music.  You decide if you like it or not.  I find that sort of thing really trite, like watching --s porn or something.   
Sound---Meh, all you hear is screams and squelching sounds.  There isn't much dialogue to listen too. 
Character----you get no real character development.  But if I remember correctly, because it's been a while.  I wanted him to hook up with his secretary I think.  Love for a rapist?!  I know, I know---the way these animes make you think...~sigh~ 
Enjoyment---I remember it, I can't say I enjoyed it since I found it an utter disappointment.  Don't ask what I was thinking I would get from watching it.  At this point I just put it down to me wanting to see as many animes as I could so I can say I watched them, even if they are crap. 
Overall---it got hire than I thought it would.  ^_^

Crest of the Stars is an odd anime. It's a grand scale Space Opera like Galactic Heroes, but it's very unique at the same time. It's famous, and in some circles infamous, for being the most elitist anime EVER made. Having watched Banner of the Stars and about --- other anime, I can confirm this is likely true. 
The word ""elitism"" gets tossed around MAL a lot. Anyone who thinks Evangelion and Texhnolyze are better than Angel Beats and Bleach gets called an ""elitist"" and soon self identifies that way. What actually is elitism? 
Definition: Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite—a select group of people with a certain ancestry, intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience—are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. 
The vast majority of shows and directors who are called ""elitist"" don't fit the bill. Hideaki Anno is an otaku who loves Cutey Honey, suffers from depression, and takes an interest in human psychology. He isn't an elitist and his shows aren't elitist. Mamoru Oshii is a socialist, so that immediately rules him out. Masaki Yuasa is playful and eccentric, but hardly an elitist. If Galactic Heroes were truly an elitist series, Yang would be the villain and Rudolph von Goldenbaum would be portrayed as the hero. This of course is not the case. 
So how does Banner of the Stars win this title? Banner is pro-colonialist, political diatribe set in space that tries to use Nietzsche's ""On the Genealogy of Morals"" to prove that superior races should rule over inferior ones. Hoo boy! 
In the future, humans use genetic engineering to create a master race of elves. The elves are more intelligent than humans, stronger, more beautiful, create better art, and create their own morality based on their superior Will to Power. The elves disdain democracy as a product of inferior peoples trying to drag down the strong, and the anime goes WAY out of its way to say the elves are ---% correct. While Galactic Heroes wishes to show the flaws and benefits of different government types, Banner of the Stars just wants to shove its message right down your throat. 
The Elves believe it would benefit the humans to be ruled over as slaves, which is a point our main human character agrees with! The only humans that oppose the elves are simply jealous and ""butthurt"" that the elves are so much better than them. The humans suffer from a ""Slave Morality"" which is based on weakness, resentfulness, and jealousy. The Elves judge good or evil by the result. They create their own values. The humans judge good and evil by intent and irrational emotions. The humans call the conquering elves ""evil"", merely because the elves being superior hurts their fee fees. The Slave Morality doesn't seek to create value, merely to drag down the superior to their level. In essence, anything the Masters stand for becomes ""evil"".  
While this series is certainly bold and shocking, I don't feel it adds anything of value to anime. It's a very simplistic, teenage surface reading of Nietzsche to push a frankly disgusting political agenda. The characters are as interesting as cardboard cut outs, and the animation is just meh. The production values are the only reason I didn't give this a -. I'm a very fair critic. 
Banner of the Stars is basically what would happen if Legend of the Galactic Heroes was written by William Luther Pierce...and then was boring as fuck on top of it. At least the script writer went on to write Witch Hunter Robin...which is just boring. At least Robin wasn't stomach churning, cringey, AND boring. The director hasn't worked on much else, but at least he went on to direct Shin Cutie Honey, the --s reboot with the massive tits.  
If you're interested in subversive art, I guess you could give this a try. On a technical scale it isn't that bad, because Sunrise agreed to make it for some unknown reason. How the hell do I end a review of the farthest right anime ever made? Well...I guess I could bring out the dead memes. (Disgusted Chinese Man) Banner of the Stars...It's just so tiresome!""

Amid the various stories we have today being bizzarras or not, we have a ""gender"" in particular incest. The anime does not pass the boundary between innuendo and relationships thus senod something nice and fun to see, containing a bit of sexual humor, becoming something more mature. 
Generally Cyclops Shoujo Saipu can be seen by all, having nothing too over the mood and incest presented, knew very well put that kind of story in episodes two minutes long. It's something I recommend for fans of this kind of good story with a bit of sexual humor.

Before reading this, bear in mind that a review by its very definition is supposed to include the writer’s opinion. While it is impossible to be completely objective in writing this review, I’ll back up my opinions of this show with appropriate reasoning.  
Story -/--  
The premise of Nagi no Asakura is that humans originally began as sea dwellers, having a thin membrane called Ena around them that enabled them to breath underwater. However, some humans started settling on the surface where they discarded their Ena. Thus, two different communities were created. Our story beings in the underwater sea village Shioshishio. The local middle school is being closed for some reason, which results in four middle schoolers having to go to school on the surface.  They face issues adjusting to the surface, and the interaction shown between them and the surface dwellers seems to be a very clear reflection of the differences between people of different cultures. They even have the equivalents of racial epithets; 'pig' for the land dwellers and 'fish' for the sea dwellers. With the basic synopsis out of the way, lets try to evaluate the story. The premise is quite unique, and the relations between the sea and surface dwellers, and their differences, provide an interesting dynamic in the start.  
However, it seems as if the major plot developments only took place to make the already contrived love triangle(s?) even more contrived. Its more of a love hexagon than a triangle. Never have I seen or heard of such a messy and silly love triangle in any form of media. At a first glance, it seems that the anime wanted to drive home the message that change should be accepted, and that some things are beyond our control, but in the end the message devolved into shounen style antics which basically say that screaming and willpower can change anything and everything. The ending was conclusive as far as dramas and romances go.  
Characters -/-- 
While the anime has multiple main characters, Hikari is very obviously the protagonist. He gets the most screen time, and the viewer gets to hear his inner thoughts. The main reason I’m giving this anime such a low rating in the characters department is Hikari. Hikari was the typical stubborn, loudmouthed, determined protagonist that has been done to death in anime, and frankly, I find myself quite tired of them. The other characters weren’t bad, but they didn’t particularly stand out either, with almost every other main character having the annoying tendency to be a martyr for the sake of others, only to create more misunderstandings. Though Tsumugu did serve as a very good foil for Hikari.  One thing very annoying in this anime about the main characters was that when a character would hear anything that they didn’t want to hear, they would … run away. It happened too many times to even count, and it ended up being extremely annoying . While I am aware of the fact that this is a fantasy anime, a drama relies on the characters and the interactions between them being realistic and natural. In this case, they were unrealistic, and felt quite unnatural . Who runs away at hearing something a little uncomfortable?!  Yes, they pull it once or twice in drama heavy animes, but it was done wayyyy too many times here. One good thing about the main characters was that they weren't forgetful. Despite having so many main characters, it was surprisingly easy to keep track of them all. Furthermore, the side characters were great. They performed their role of aiding the character development of the main characters quite well. 
Sound -/-- 
The sound really made this anime seem better than it really was. While I found the rest of the soundtrack to be well done but forgetful, the first ending is one of the best endings that I have ever heard to an anime. During the first half, as the episode would near the end, you could hear the beginnings of this song and given the situation, it just went perfectly with the anime. The voice acting was pretty good though, although I personally found the voice for Manaka to be a bit too childlike and high pitched at times. 
Art -/-- 
The art was very colorful, and quite beautifully animated. I really liked the underwater sections. However, it was also a bit too cutesy, with the characters having very huge eyes, and the females having an inexplicable, constant blush on their cheeks.  
Enjoyment -/-- 
By the end, it became a chore to watch this anime. I had to finish it, because I was invested in the story, but I grew increasingly frustrated by the characters by each passing episode, especially by Hikari, which sucked since he was the main character. Oftentimes, it felt that the characters liked Hikari only because the plot required them to like him. I tried to like this anime, but I really couldn’t. While I wouldn’t go as far as to say that I regret watching this anime, watching it felt somewhat of a waste.  
Overall -/-- 
Nagi no Asukara is primarily a drama romance, with fantasy only existing to serve both these story elements. It had an interesting story , but the whole love hexagon felt pretty convoluted. There were many cliches in this anime that are unfortunately found way too often in dramas. It has some pretty art and interesting music which serves to make this anime look better than it actually is, but I found some parts of the story and a few character to be lacking in depth. It also suffered from poor pacing in the start. However, viewers who aren't annoyed by your typical protagonist, and generally like drama heavy romances will probably like this anime. I personally think that that the -.-- avg rating this anime has on MAL is way too generous.  
PS: Feel free to pm me if you think I missed something in the anime, or if there was something really wrong with the way I wrote this review

At dusk, you see her: a girl dancing with the leaves. She laughs beautifully, moves elegantly, and sings wonderfully. Said maiden invites you to dance with her. Such a commanding presence compels you to embark as if she were waiting for you. 
Presentation is key. 
You could have easily found yourself unamused by childish antics, or unamused with how she treated such activities so seriously. You instead found yourself captivated, reaching out to her to know more and to experience this quirky spectacle with her. This is no easy feat. It's a delicate balance, a tonal tightrope trod ever so gracefully by this charming vixen of a series. This isn't to say she never loses that balance, but it’s clear that she is a majestic raven. 
Her friends certainly have their own quirks, even if none of them are quite as fun as she is. They're at their best together, interacting with their daily ghost stories to varying degrees of knowledge and style. The mysteries they unravel and the misadventures they deal with are more than intriguing, whether they’re about the girl or about these new friends of ours. It seems that romance also bloomed in front of you, adding another layer of charm to the group, to the maiden that inducted you, to the music you all hear, and to the wonderful environment she would constantly frolic in. It's strange since not everything should work as well as it does, and indeed it doesn't, but the fleeting yet lengthy time spent more than speaks for itself, for all its faults and all its whimsical, even theatrical wonders.  
The maiden's dance ends. A bittersweet farewell always follows. For all the tripping and all the headache, it was fun while it lasted, this blissful dusk.

EDIT: People, people. I went and saw this in a movie theater. In real life. Please stop asking me where you can download it, because I don't know. Thank you! 
As perfect as they were, I almost regret giving the other two movies tens, for now I have no numerical way of showing that this one is far superior to even them. Spoilers for those movies, obviously. 
Anyone who's seen the main Monogatari series can tell you that the difference between pre-Kizu Araragi and post-Kizu Araragi is like night and day. The question, though, is this: what happened in Kizu to change him so dramatically? There were two catalysts: Hanekawa and Kissshot. In Nekketsu, we saw him learn the joy of true friendship when Hanekawa obstinately stuck by him where any sane human wouldn't have. In Reiketsu, we see the effect Kissshot had on him. This relied on buildup from the previous two movies - through them, the viewer and Araragi had to come to like Kissshot. But this is a review for Reiketsu, so I'll quickly move on to why that's important here and now. You know how Kizu has been devoid of the signature Araragi narration that pervades the main series? It comes back after a certain scene in this movie. My belief is that it's intended as a delineator between pre- and post-Kizu Araragi. ""This scene is where the transition was complete."" I don't want to go into further detail because I don't want to force my interpretation on you, but the takeaway from this paragraph is this: Araragi's character arc in Kizu is very cleverly done, making use of both female leads, who themselves have character arcs. 
Readers of the book know that there's a very long talk scene in this movie (after the one I was just alluding to), meaning that Shaft has to pull out all their Monogatari tricks to keep the viewer's eyes open. And they do it well. The tone shifts at a moment's notice, with the OST and the animation style as its indicators, keeping it from becoming monotonous. The comedic timing was brilliant, enhancing jokes to be even more funny. The symbolism is cheesy and heavy-handed - to comedic effect. It was clear that Shaft knew they were being ridiculous with the symbolism in this scene. 
This has nothing to do with Shaft, but the juxtaposition of the two talk scenes (both of which I talked about, believe it or not) really is brilliant. It's like a modified Hero's Journey template that has two Audience with the Father sections. It raises the stakes for the Ultimate Boon section. 
Speaking of which, let's talk about that, shall we? The fight scene in this movie was a lot longer and more action-packed than I remember it being in the novel. Frankly, it was amazing. Several parts of it were somehow silly and badass at the same time. The best part, though, was that we knew our characters. They were both unique, well-developed, and interesting. Think about - REALLY think about the climactic showdowns you've seen and name one that fits all three of those criteria. Ain't easy, is it? 
But as any reader of the novel knows, the real climax of this story is the very, very end. Remember that legendary narration from the last few paragraphs of the novel? They kept it. Every last word. A huge number of factors make it so that the end of the fight scene isn't also the end of the movie's tension. Your socks will be blown off. 
After writing so much about this movie, it made me realize why I consider it so much better than the first two, though they were perfect too: out of the three Kizu installments, this is the one that feels most like a standalone movie. Its tone shifts multiple times, its pacing is extremely varied, and it feels like it has a proper climax. What was Tekketsu's climax? ""Pleasure doin' business with you."" It was hard to say that that movie was anything more than set-up (albeit very good set-up) for the next two. What was Nekketsu's climax? ""I'm not a human anymore."" The story was quite obviously nowhere near any satisfying endpoint, and we had two character arcs very openly unresolved. It was, again, hard to argue that it had merit as a standalone movie. These problems were borne of Aniplex's decision to cut Kizu into three, which is why they didn't affect my scores for the movies themselves, but it's worth noting why Reiketsu is so much better than Tekketsu and Nekketsu. 
Now that I've talked at you for five friggin' hours, I'd like to end my review with this. Out of all the anime movies I've seen here in Japan so far (Kimi no Na wa, KnK, Nekketsu, Planetarian, Kagerou Daze, AC...), this is the only one where I've walked out of the theater and thought to myself, ""I want to see this again, right now."" 
Oh, and there's no post-credits scene. Sorry! No ""Owari S- soon"" or ""Musubi in stores now"" or anything.

Yeah i know you are most likely here because you're expecting to find something similar to SAO. Well it's very different really although really enjoyable, Log Horizon does not have tha same vision on the problem of getting stuck in a videogame as SAO. Log Horizon in that sense is ""more real"" because it explores what would happen if people got stuck in a videogame indefinetly ( in SAO at least they knew they had to complete the game for it to end) so it wonders how would people organize themselves, how would the interaction between NPC (non player characters) and characters would be, and how would this affect psycologically the characters. It explains all this while a bigger threat within the game is inminent, which makes this anime very good, exciting, and gives you something to reflect about.  
I recomd this anime because it combines perfectly action, adventure, comedy and gives you to think about.

The story was such a train wreck, and none of the characters are even the slightest bit likable, but the fights are okay and it has one of the best opening themes in recent history. Cracking jokes with people about how bad it was is surprisingly enjoyable as it's just that bad, and I think anyone who wants to be a writer should watch it and see just how much it's possible to completely mangle plot and pacing.

There is alot to be said about this show. It is awful. I certainly don't recommend to watch. You waste your time. You don't really make any sense of what's happening. 
If you already seen the -rd season. You don't need to watch the -th season at all, because most of the plot is reused from season -. 
The whole plot of this series is literally about alternate Tenchi Muyou universes series characters while reusing plot from the original trilogy. This is not Tenchi Muyou Ryououki anymore. The main characters barely exist in this series. The only thing that exists is maybe the Tenchi residence. 
The way they do it is by cutting everything the show had good in it, starting with the main characters, with the art itself, and by literally throwing dialogue as a main plot device, to introduce a new main character in the place of Tenchi. The original characters have little to nothing to do with this show, while there are introduced up to -- characters per episode. 
The art was wholly digital, and the old Tenchi drawing style was redone into a new one. Most of the characters where copy paste with few alters. Colors were poor. Very few shades were used. Contours, what are those. The backgrounds where redone as well and because of that we won't be seeing but few residences, most of the time - Tenchi's.  
Sound was obviously poor. I am ashamed to hear this. The intro and the outro changed the whole tonality of the show. They don't have anything to do with it really.  
The story is awful. There is nothing but too much dialogue with little to nothing about anything that really matters in this series which is hard to follow and make sense of it.

""I want to eat your pancreas"" was very hard to sit through. Not because it was heartbreaking, but because it was really bland. 
The story is simple, but good; it just needs to have characters we care about for the story to be good. This is where the movie completely falls apart for me. 
The two main characters are very two dimensional, and only one of them is even likable: The likable one is the happy/extroverted one, the other one is the book otaku. The only good scenes are the ones where the extroverted one does things, usually by herself. 
The side characters are really annoying and repetitive. 
On the technical aspects it's nothing special, even though movies have bigger budgets. 
I don't remember the OST, if there even was any. The Credits playing like an OP (like Your Name) was really forced. 
Some scenes look great, but most look really cheap. The CGI looked odd in this movie. The exposition scenes are well written, but are directed in such a lifeless way. Most of the movie feels lifeless actually. Panning shot. Panning shot. Panning shot. 
I didn't enjoy this. I can see other people enjoy it, however.

I am DONE with this shotacon stuff. I didnt know it was going to be shotacon when I found it looking through Arinfantasy's site. 
First of all, I am permanently traumatized with Boku no Pico and it was not smart of me to start watching something without A.) reading the summary B.) checking MAL C.) not even seeing the front cover 
The plot (-) was thin and it was just another hentai anime that's more fappable than enjoyable to watch. 
Art (-): There was no eye candy here. Miisu was... not that attractive and Kuro looked like a girl (+- for cuteness --- for girly uke) 
sound (-): I guess I liked(?) the OP and ED it wasnt too bad yet it wasnt the best. I've heard worse. As for the sex sounds. Typical ""ah"" moaning sound. 
Character (-): I dont get these characters but at the end, there was a bit of back story on those characters. However, Kuro was alittle appealing when he got mad because he actually kicked butt. 
Enjoyment (-): I found the entire idea of shotacon really gross and twisted. But it's mainly because of pedophila and my undying hate towards girly ukes. (that's why I joined the non girly uke club) 
Overall (-): It was funny at one point and another and other times i just want to punch Miisu because his face annoys me. At other times I cringed because it was so gross (the banana scene and ESPECIALLY the salad scene) 
!!RANT TIME!! skip if you dont want to hear me rant 
I watch/ read yaoi for PLOT and because I find it fun and interesting seeing two guys go at it. But if the featured event in an anime/manga is to get the other guy into bed, then count me out. The more realistic the characters are, the better. I mean, it's not like I can walk out of my house and see really girly boys. (regardless of age and sexuality)  
I dont want to rant now so let me cut it off here

I'd give this a resounding, and low toned ""meh."" at best. I hear great things about Berserk. The few episodes I've seen of the anime are wonderful, and I plan to watch the rest and even started buying the manga. I had quite high hopes for this movie, since the rest has been great. That may contribute to why I was let down. This movie is frankly crap, and if you like Berserk, do yourself a favor and skip this in particular. 
The character development is rushed, and poorly explained at best. Guts feels very shallow, and Griffith is even more shallow. The story line would be okay if they dove into more parts. The intro, before we know much about Guts here, is awesome. And it's all downhill from there. The pacing is off. I felt *obligated* to like this and watch it the rest of the way, but I regret that decision now.

Monster starts off with Dr.Tenma, a Japanese doctor practicing in Germany. Everything goes well and then BAM. Everything he has worked for is ruined when he saves the life of a boy called Johan. After this all the drama, plot twists, betrayals,and just plain insanity starts as Dr.Tenma has to figure out just who is this &quot;monster&quot; that has criminals shaking in their boots. 
One thing that made me a little cautious of this anime was the pace but once it got past the rough spots I could not put this one down.  One think I did like was that every little thing in each episode contributes somewhat to the entire plot. Even the minor characters have some bearing on everything in the end, each answering questions and bringing up even more. 
I feel the art deserves some sort of special treatment on this one. When I first saw the art I did not like it that much but after watching the anime more and more it just seemed more unique than any other anime I had seen before. It had a realistic tone to it which provided more in overall enjoyment. Although  I think that the noses were really exaggerated. One characters nose, Dr.Reichwine's, was just so large I chuckled a bit when I first saw it. 
I gave this anime a -- overall because I believe that the plot, character development, and story are so intellectually put out that it just added to the enjoyment of the anime in all its entirety.

Colorful - a wonderful movie that keeps your emotions running. This movie follows the story about a soul that has won a lottery, allowing him to return to the normal world to find out the sin that he committed. 
Although the movie starts off slow, you will surely love it when it ends. This movie teaches the audience how important life is and why we should cherish everyday as though it is our last. 
The art in this movie was done very well. The use of still photo pictures was brilliant to show how life was back in the days. The characters were drawn consistently throughout the movie.  
The sound and background music that were used were synced to the scene in the movie. The one thing about the sound that I did not go crazy about was the voice actor for Kobayashi Makoto. As readers of this review, you may have different opinions of it but to me, there was not enough emotion into what he was saying. The emotion of the voice was not consistent throughout the movie, other than that, I had no problems with the movie. 
The characters of the movie were well-developed. Each supporting character had about the same amount of screen time. The personalities of each and every character were brought up. 
Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. The producers of the movie did a splendid job in creating this movie. I'm glad I took the time to view this.

WARNING: This review contains (some) spoiler elements — without which the problematic aspects of the show could not possibly be discussed — and makes use of language that is not entirely PG---. 
Proceed at your own risk.  
--------------- 
Ahh, Yuri!!! on ICE. Possibly the highest-praised, most-watched anime of this season. 
So popular it is, I’ve had to blacklist like eight different tags on tumblr to spare my eyes of it. This thing is fucking everywhere. And don’t get me wrong, its popularity is not the problem here; hell, I was expecting to be right aboard the bandwagon, right at the front, driving the goddamn train. 
When I made my list for stuff I’ll chew this season, it was right at the top in terms of anticipation; from the synopsis alone, it sounded exactly like my kind of thing — figure skating is an old love of mine, and the promise of beautiful animation drew me right in. (Though IRL I prefer watching female figure-skaters, it’s still a novel thing in anime, and, well. You take what you can. Discounting Onna’s brief figure skating scene in Death Parade, and maybe some romantic “let’s go skating” type of dates in shoujo, I legitimately cannot remember seeing it elsewhere off the top of my head.) 
And I tried to stay optimistic about it. An optimism that lasted about two episodes, until the crass, bleak humor (weight jokes, really? frig right off, mate) and the wildly fluctuating quality of animation began to make it jet-pack right outta this mess. 
Little did I know, those two things would end up being the more minor of my issues with the show. 
--------------- 
STORY & CHARACTERS 「 - / -- 」 
Don’t let the synopsis fool you; this is not an enjoyable tale of sportsmanship and high-voltage rivalries that make sparks fly on the rink. Russian Yuri gives up on winning back Victor’s tutelage before the season is even half through (and he never had it to begin with, turns out).  
Even if that doesn’t particularly bother you (and you’re here just for the hot guys and the homoerotic subtext that “isn’t subtext at all”), the whole thing is extremely ill-paced: important plot (ha, plot. what plot?) elements are only mentioned as an “Oh, yeah, by the way---” kind of afterthought, while moments which are supposed to be either tense / suspenseful or dramatic fall flat. It’s very shoddy work, and while I was still willing to forgive it, the show did two things: fucked up in the animation department, and then the...”romance” happened.  
Let’s be very clear on one thing here: if you’re straight, you write gay relationships — especially those involving characters of the sex opposite yours — at your own risk.  
Because --% of the time you will fail, and you will fail hard. 
People like to praise the show for being “progressive” (and about a bajillion other terms that mean the same thing and are mindlessly thrown around) in including (and centering its focus on) a canonically gay, canonically engaged / soon to be married couple, they fail to recognize (or willfully ignore, and I’m not sure which is worse) the problems with Victor and Yūri’s relationship. In plain English: this is a gay couple written by a straight woman. A gay MALE couple which has your stereotypical heterosexual dynamics. 
I feel the need to stress this. 
Stereotypical. Heterosexual. Dynamics. 
You see, despite what you’d think, relationships between people of the same sex don’t work the way stereotypical straight ones do. Hell, most healthy relationships of any kind don’t and shouldn’t work like that. It’s a common misconception that gay people mimic straight ones and it bugs the shit out of me. Most depictions in media (which are not written by actual gay people, that is) give in to this misconception, and from thereon it becomes clear at who the product is aimed at. A little like lesbian porn, if you will. 
(Hint: it ain’t for the lesbians!) 
Let me put it another way: this is little more than veiled yaoi, and it’s not particularly tasteful yaoi at that. 
Not only does Yūri refer to himself as the “woman” who seduces the playboy, they even fit your standard seme/uke stereotypes, with Victor being a hetare/wanko seme (a devoted loser, basically) dressed as a “cool” type at first glance, and Yūri being the sasoi (seductive) uke dressed in an “everyman” type’s clothes. Hell, these combinations of character types, as well as the dynamic between them, literally form one of the two most basic, stereotypical types of  relationship found in the genre.  
And, you know, this would’ve been less of a problem if at least the characters were interesting beyond this. It wouldn’t have made it forgivable — I hold the opinion that you should be honest about what you do and especially about what you write, and trying to sell me yaoi labeled as a “good romance” is a filthy, filthy lie — but it would’ve made it bearable. Perhaps even slightly enjoyable. 
Unfortunately, the characters weren’t interesting. 
It’s like the author opened up tvtropes, cracked her knuckles, and set about finding and writing the most basic characters she could, structuring each of them around a particular trope or “type”. Everyone in this show is flat, and I don’t mean in terms of breast size. There’s no character development, either, despite what some fans of it will try to tell you (though this doesn’t particularly bother me in a show, to be honest, so this at least is a neutral point in my book); it’s all one big onion, making me more frustrated with every layer I peel and put aside. 
It’s a parade of stereotypes, flattened to absolute thinness. 
The comedy, what little of it is there, is...lackluster. Downright terrible at times, really. And not in a good, shitty pun kind of way. Likewise for the dramatic moments, which manage to be boring rather than induce an “oh no my babies!” reaction. 
--------------- 
ART & ANIMATION 「 - / -- 」 
Oh, god, where do I even begin. 
Look, I know I cannot expect ridiculously HQ animation in every episode of an anime, not every studio is ufotable — who at this point can probably open their own damn bank — but if you know your budget is not that large, you generally do two things: conserve it so it’s steady throughout and bring out the big guns on moments that truly matter. You’d think those moments would be the skating montages and maybe the Big Damn Kiss moment, but...they aren’t. I mean the kiss itself was decently animated, if cowardly camouflaged, but the skating montages? No. Instead we got HQ animations of Victor’s (admittedly shapely) butt. 
Wonderful. 
And it’s not even that big of a loss, in retrospect, which is where another big problem arises: whoever choreographed and thought up these routines did a very shitty job. Sorry not sorry about the language but, honestly, subtlety can’t convey how bummed I am about this. Part of me was glad to not see this much bad choreography in HQ, even though that would probably have helped it be at least somewhat better. 
Considering they got an actual former figure skater in on the job, this is a huge let-down. 
The moves are repetitive, and the fact that frequently the animation wasn’t at least half as good as it could’ve been, made pretty much every skating montage — except perhaps the one Yūri does when copying Victor’s old routine, which I begrudgingly admit was nice — extremely disappointing. 
Similarly, the character designs are poorly done (beyond every character fitting a certain Character Type™, so that the myriad of fangirls can Pick A Favorite — which is unimaginative, but not bad by itself). I expect a certain flamboyance and creativity when it comes to figure skating, but here the costumes just ended up looking either badly sewn-together or silly, the kind of thing a kid would wear for Halloween, or both. Kitschy, for all its oddities, is not a word I generally associate with the sport. And it’s one that I frankly wish I don’t have to associate with it ever again. 
The lack of consistency in animation, the bad choreography, the designs that alternate between ridiculous and boring, make for an absolute cringe-fest. Surprising, considering the director, but I guess all of us have bad days. 
--------------- 
SOUND 「 - / -- 」 
The voice cast was...nice, I suppose (I don’t remember anyone’s VA but Victor’s, and that’s because I’m a fan of Junichi Suwabe). The soundtrack on the other hand is extremely forgettable — I genuinely only remember the opening, and even that very vaguely; I didn’t particularly like it and thus tended to skip past — so I cannot pronounce myself there. Generally sound doesn’t matter much to me past the VAs’ performances, as this makes for a huge part of the characters, but in a show that is (supposedly) about figure skating, this did come off as something of a disappointment. Music should complement a routine, even add to it, but here it did a big whoop of nothing. 
--------------- 
ENJOYMENT 「 - / -- 」 
If it wasn’t clear enough — I did not enjoy this. With every new episode I felt my horror increase as the show kept getting worse while at the same time somehow amassing an even bigger fanbase and even more praise it was, in my opinion, deeply undeserving of. 
Yuri!!! on ICE is not a good anime. It’s not even a mediocre one. It’s terrible, even if only because it tries to pretend it’s something it’s not: an effort to be inclusive. I’d call SJW bullshit on this, had it really been aimed at actual gay people and not at the hordes of gullible fangirls who want to feel good about their fetishization of homosexuality, who have found in this series a virtual gold mine that they can point at and present as proof they “support the gays” when confronted or otherwise called out. 
Actually, you know what, I’m gonna call SJW bullshit on it anyway. Many of its fans, from what I’ve seen, tend to fall into the category of straw, third-wave feminists. The author (Kubo) strikes me as one, too. 
--------------- 
OVERALL 「 - / -- 」 
I’d sooner shoot myself in the foot than go near this again. I’m probably going to eat my pride and beat my completion OCD into submission when the second season will air. And it will air, don’t doubt it — this has birthed a franchise that has the potential to become more milkable than SAO.  
I guess there’s some sort of sweet, vicious sense of retribution in the capitalization off of its thirsty fans (anything can become popular if there’s a plain enough self-insertable MC or the chance of two guys touching dicks — and YOI manages to deliver both, as switching Yūri’s gender does fuck-all to change the story, so really, in a sense it’s a show for everyone), but it’s a small comfort that cannot wash out the bad taste I’ve been left with.

Just so you know this is going to ge an extremly one-sided review 
That beeing said, let me start: 
As a person, who has already seen the other seasons of the monogatari franchise, I could already kind of guess what will come to me. 
Plus I had already read the book. 
First I was a bit sad by the fact that there will be - Films and thought they will strech the story, but that was a completly unreasonable fear. They pretty much put every scene of the book, well... around the first -rd of it, into that anime. 
Of course they had adjusted it here and there, so it made an even better movie. 
The art-style btw is something at least I haven't seen before, it is obviously pretty ""shaft-looking"" but they had, what I guess, CG-Background but the characters where animated by hand. 
This is usualy something that would turn me off, IF the CG was bad, which it ISN'T! 
Short: the animation is beautifull and gorgeous. 
I really loved it --/--.

Let's face it, the animation and art style were the two things that really drew me into this show. They were able to combine elements from lots of different movies and make it into something unique. The story starts off with - middle school students who live in the sea. They are forced to attend school on the surface after their school closes. What follows is an immense adjusting to the life in Oshiooshi. At first, the sea and the surface are tense and upset with each other, but somehow this anime tells the tale of how they are able to finally have the two villages coincide. Alongside that, there's a growing climate change that will affect the two worlds unless something is done.  
This anime has it's positives and it's negatives. I'll start with the positives. 
Animation 
Stated above. Probably the MOST beautifully animated and drawn anime I've ever seen. That made up for the negatives in the show! I can go on and on about it. I mean, just look at the screenshots and the pictures! 
Music 
A beachy/sea anime has to have good music that makes you feel like you're at the ocean, and A Lull in the Sea does exactly. The soundtrack is so well written, and it will have you connecting with the sounds of the ocean.  
Characters 
For me, this one was impressive, the character development was amazing. Since this anime was focused on changing, you could tell they put a lot of effort into how the characters adapted to their new enviornment. Probably my favorite out of all the characters was Hikari. He just really changed for the better, and it was so nice to see that progression, while still mainting his stubborn character that made him lovable.  
Story Progression 
They split it up into two arcs, and it was very effectively done. The pacing was great and I didn't ever feel like it was moving slowly.  
~Neutral~ 
The love triangle...or Polygon...  
I do like romance, and I know this was a big part of the anime. I did enjoy the romance but at times it got me kind of irritated since most of the love was unriquitted and it just didn't seem to get anywhere. It had me feeling annoyed when things didn't work out. It was really big mess of this person liking this person, but that person liked another person and so on. Most that stuff doesn't get resoved until the end. I still found the drama and the feelings that the characters went through relatable and it did keep me hooked as I wanted to know who ened up with who.  
~Negatives~ 
The Ending 
This may be just me but I was a little sad at the ending. It wasn't terrible, per say, but I wish things had been different. I won't spoil anything, but I did finish the anime and say ""man, i wish that ____ happened"". That's more just personally. If you don't care about said thing, it is a nice ending. They tied it all together and it was very cute! (sorry this makes no sense) 
So as you can see it was a very great expirience. It's a good length and if you like romance, and drama, this will be the anime for you because there's lots of it! I hope you enjoyed my review, congrats if you read until the end haha.I had a hard time rating this anime a -, to be honest it should be a -.- or higher in my book. Definitley one of my top --!

This is my first anime movie that I have watched that wasn't part of a series. I watched trailer after trailer that built up this desire to see this movie. I will say that this movie was quite enjoyable but by the end I found myself disappointed.  
The story was going strong all the way up till the end. A whale? A chance to be a god but instead choose a sword? A random freaking blackhole in the center of humans with no real explanation why? And then not living in the beast world but become a student and now can overcome ""the difficult trails of homework""? I'll repeat by saying I was disappointed. 
The characters themselves were good. Kumatetsu kind of cool but overrated. Ren was sort of a crybaby, but was still cheering him on. The art was quite pleasing. Sound was good.  
But the God forsaken end...

at first you love this anime because of its story. this anime has great story.and when its about terror you will feel attractive about it.but the plot of this anime is worst.this anime has lots of flaws about story plotting.also they don't give sufficient information about characters which is very disappointing.if they extend this anime - more ep for describing everything clearly it will be best.starting of this anime is great.after watching this kind of starting generally you expect more.but alas!..plotting is ruin everything goods about it.it looks like they skip almost many things which is related to anime...also you need to more explanation about characters. it was like they come from nowhere.

I love fan service and ecchi as much as the next guy but god damn. 
For those who don't I'm a Josh and today I am reviewing the OVA Eiken. Let's get this over with. 
Story- It's basically the generic harem trope. The thing that is about as overused as Mechs and Generic Slice of Life characters. Basically the nerdy wimp joins the Eiken club surrounded by girls who have bigger breast then most girls in their grade along with two of their teachers. Need I say more. Just saying that you can immediately conclude that this is a generic harem anime. Overall -/-- 
Art- If you get by the massively large breast intended to give you a noise bleed and the fan service every --- minutes...meh. Overall -/-- 
Sound- Compared to some of the stuff I hear, it's average. Not something grand or completely bad but it is average. -/-- 
Characters: We got all your favorites in this one. Nerdy wimp, big breast girl who loves sucking things, a fat ass bear, big breast girl, semi big breast girl, big breast teacher, loli with a robot, another big breast teacher and a -th grader with big ass breast 
...Wait what? Let me check that one more time. Bare with me on this people. 
Big breast girl who loves sucking anything shaped like a...I'm sure you can guess what it is without me saying it, a big ass bear, big breast girl, semi big breast girl, big breast teacher, loli with a robot, big breast teacher and -th grader with big ass boobs...... 
....Well it happened people. It finally happen. I never thought I see this day come and you probably didn't either. But the world finally did. They are finally let ----- year old girls get breast enhancements. Parents and teachers a like finally gave in and allowed young girls to get breast enhancements, hypnotizing all those middle schoolers with the main intention of this to distract them and make them want to do thinks people their age shouldn't even think about.  
It's an incredible moment and we might as well get used to it because this. This right here. -th graders with breast enhancements is going to become a common thing. It will be the biggest thing in the near future...... 
...Oh who the f*ck am I kidding with this. WTF?! Overall -/--

Overall- Eiken is just pure fan service that is about as borderline hentai as it can get. The story is one that is overused. The sound and animation are particular horrible but that really the only good thing I can fully say about it. But overall I will give Eiken a -/--. It's bad and goes a little to far with the ecchi and fan service but I have honestly seen worst

Are you all ready for another slice of life comedy about a group of ladies? I've reviewed quite a few of these and, to be fair, they're usually enjoyable enough. Non Non Biyori came out, in anime form, in late ----. It's based on a still ongoing manga by Atto that started in ----. The anime was brought to us by Silver Link, the same studio behind Baka to Test, WataMote, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry &, the only good thing I've seen from them thus far, Yuri Kuma Arashi. I have to say, that pedigree does not inspire confidence. But let's take a look at the series and see if it can bring Silver Link's numbers up to two worthwhile anime. 
Story: 
We open in the country with a school where one teacher takes care of all the elementary and middle school students. Her job may  sound terribly difficult until you learn that she has all of five students. Our main characters are the four girls in the class. The first grader, Renge. Fifth grader Hotaru. Seventh grader, Natsumi & her older sister, eighth grader Komari. The four of them enjoy their quiet and peaceful lives while keeping one another company and interacting with the friendly folks in their little country town.  
Okay, so the ways this slice of life series about a group of girls differentiates itself from other slice of life series about groups of girls is with the country setting and the fairly substantial age differences among the girls. To be fair, that is a pretty big difference and the series is good at taking advantage of both the setting and the age gaps for the sake of humour.  
That being said, the humour isn't always on the mark. There are times where they'll rely on doing something odd to be fun without regard to the fact that odd does not necessarily equate to funny. This does result in some jokes that fall flat.  
Characters: 
The characters in this are pretty nicely done. They aren't the most complex group out there, but they are nicely fleshed out without being overly exaggerated. Resulting in characters who have a nice level of verisimilitude. The character interactions are also nicely done. A lot of the funniest scenes in the series revolve around the interactions. In fact, the best comedic moments in this series may all stem from Hotaru's interactions with Komari. It's not  just the comedy, I'll also give the series credit for having some strong emotional moments that just explore the connections among the characters. Particularly with Renge & Kaede, a side character who runs the candy store.  That being said, some of the side characters are a bit weak. You get some sense of personality from them, but it's not much. Like the one male student who never talks and is just kind of a supportive brother to Konami & Natsumi or  Renge's eldest sister, who acts as the school teacher and has a lazy shtick going.  
Art:  
The artwork in this is quite good. Particularly the nature scenes and backgrounds. The nature scenery in this is really superb. The characters look fine, but they're also pretty typical of the genre.  The various objects that the characters interact with are nicely detailed.  
Sound: 
Our major characters are voiced by Murakawa Rie (GochiUsa's Megumi), Asumi Kana (Neptunia's Blanc), Sakura Ayane (Love Live's Arisa) & Koiwai Kotori. The four of them give strong performances. As does Satou Rina. The biggest weakness is Nazuka Kaori. Wile she is a good actress, as evidenced by her performances in Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood & Soul Eater, her character in this just doesn't have much going for her so she spends the entire anime sounding mellow without any real emotional variation.  
Ho-yay: 
There's a bit. Hotaru openly has a massive crush on Komari. There's also some indication that the feelings are reciprocated. I wouldn't be surprised if the two of them ended up dating at some point. Probably won't last, given their young ages, though. Then again, if Nanoha and Fate can make it work, it's possible. 
Final Thoughts: 
That was Non Non Biyori. It holds up pretty strongly. The characters are memorable and endearing. The nature scenes are lovely and it has enough differences from the standard slice of life series to keep it fresh. That being said, I wouldn't call it one of the best out there, since the humour does fall short at times. But if you want something cutesy with some very strong character interactions, this might be for you. My final rating is going to be a solid -/--. Next week I'll take a look at Binbougami ga.

NGE is what originally got me hooked on anime, and I recently decided to watch the whole series again. 
It really is not possible to make a decent review of this without including the End of Evangelion anime as well, as is finishes the series of in a decent way. The actual two last episodes in this series (not to mention Death & rebirth, which you should avoid), are meaningless without watching ""End of EVA"". 
Overall, this is a great anime. Epic, dep and philosophical with awsome characters and graphics. Too bad there is too much still pictures in it, though. 
Animation	 
Everything is beautifully drawn, with great character design, cool mechas and unique ""monsters"". Sadly, there is not much ""animation"" going on; way too much time is spent looking at still pictures while listening to dialogue/monologoues. Ok, it's almost -- years old, but that's not a reason not to compare it to newer stuff. 
Sound	 
Neat and catchy intro tune and decent but somewhat anonymous background music. Voice acting is great and sound effects feel well thought out and add to the mood. 
Story	 
Whoo! This is epic! Starting out as straight-forward mecha action, and evolving into really deep philosophical stuff. I won't ramble about the good stuff (most of it is), but I must say, however, that many things could be clarified a bit more in depth. Sadly, this is something you get used to after watching anime for a while. Another downside is the last two episodes. They are a total mess! A lot less so after you have watched ""The end of Evangelion"", but still a mess. 
Character	 
This is character development at its best. The characters are all likable in their own ways, and throughout the episodes they all get plenty of time to grow. There is a lot of angst in all of them, and it gets worse and worse the further you watch. It becomes clear in the end that this anime is not really about action, it's about human nature. And the characters all feel human.

this was not worth watching. to be honest I only watched it to see Soul and Maka again. its art was very different from SE which left me feel disappointed. It does give the show a new perspective and we see the beginning of Liz and Patty's story in a way. Yes this review is short, but the anime wasn't a show stopper............ Sorry but its true

For some shows, I feel it necessary to go through each category and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. But for this one, I was really only left with two significant realizations: 
-. Watching Toradora! is like taking a stallion's dose of viagra just before strolling through a Renaissance art gallery. Never, in my entire life, have I seen a show that draws out the sexual tension between its characters for so long. The cruelty of this phenomenon, however, was intensely refreshing. Most other shows in the same genre rely solely on eye candy to hold their viewers' attention; Toradora! simply refuses to do that- and with good reason. It's as if the producers are shouting, ""look, everyone- we've got great voice actors, great music, great character development, and a great plot- so we're not going to spam cleavage every two minutes and risk having you miss out on all the good stuff."" 
-. If you're similar to me, you probably don't like a few specific genres. Not just anime genres- I'm talking about all forms of art. For instance, I don't particularly like country music, modern art, or- and here's where I retain topical relevance- romance anime. I mean, seriously. Nine times out of ten, animated romcoms make me feel like a perverted, balding sociopath. Or at least, I'm pretty sure that they would if I had actually watched ten of them (and I definitely haven't). But the thing is, every genre has at least a couple masterpieces- art that even the snobbiest critics can't help but appreciate. Well, Toradora! is definitely one of the few exceptions to my hatred for romantic anime. The reason I bring this up is to encourage those of you who are on the fence to give it a try. People who normally like romcoms have already seen it ages ago; but I can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy it, too- regardless of how cynical you may be.

Wolf Children is a movie about two kids named Yakisoba and Acme who are born from a werewolf and a woman so immune to age it'd make Ash Ketchum jealous. After the death of the werewolf, and the tragic realization that furries are literally trash as the dead wolf body is slung unceremoniously into a garbage truck, the woman takes them to the middle of nowhere and takes care of them by mooching stuff off of the neighbors and a small bit of cash that the father saved up for them that never seems to get all spent. Acme is an edgy boy who grows up to leave his mother in exchange for a random fox guy to protect the forest from the terrible dangers that threaten it, such as rain storms, bears, and farmers! Yakisoba falls in love with a boy who she had nearly killed just a few years prior because he said she smelled like a dog and the guy has no problems with it. 
Story: It's riddled with plot holes and cliche arcs. There is nothing groundbreaking or extravagant here. The story's quality is comparable to the more decent half of fanfiction. -/-- 
Art: While the scenes when they waere transferring between human and wolf were kind of awkward looking, the art was pretty good. The partial -D look takes a while to grow on you, but its unique style made it appealing once you got used to it. -/-- 
Sound: The voice acting was great and one of the best parts of the movie. The voice acting started going down the drain during the wolf scenes, but otherwise their human voices were great. They sounded age-appropriate, realistic, and much more natural than the glass-shattering squeal most kids are given in anime. Even the adults in the movie were given plain voices. It wasn't too hard to imagine that I was actually just walking around Japan and listening to the people on the side of the street talk. -/-- 
Character: Almost every character was one-dimensional, and the ones that weren't were shallow. They had very specific roles, with the biggest character development coming when the siblings simply switched roles of who was the ""most human"" and who was the ""most wolf"" halfway through the movie. -/-- 
Enjoyment: Despite how weak the story and the characters were, the movie was still fairly entertaining to watch. There were some humorous pieces to it, and it did it's job just well enough to provide a mild sense of excitement or suspense at the appropriate scenes. -/-- 
Overall: Averages to a -.-/--, rounded to a -/--. However I give it an overall score of -/-- due to the paragraph that follows. 
Simply put, this anime is a Ghibli movie in every sense except that it wasn't actually made by Ghibli. It's a fun anime movie that will inevitably be popularized in Western countries. It's a family-friendly movie with a cool, supernatural story with little kids taking up quite a few of the lead role slots. It serves its purpose as the target audience doesn't pay much attention to plot holes and overdone tropes anyway. When you take those two elements out, the movie is much better overall as it has great art and voice acting, and is enjoyable as well. This movie deserves its place right next to Ponyo and Spirited Away, and if put there any non-anime fan wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

ONE’s superpower to decorate trite truths with intricate details is as astounding as his ability to create identical all mighty protagonists. For half of the story he manages to deceive me into rumination about how complex is the coming-of-age problems of Shigeo are, how delicate and colourable the plot about his brother, and how surprisingly peaceful the anime about psychics is. Yet you can not swim against the (main)stream forever, ONE or not, eventually the boat of goodness will pick you up, exhausted, and carry you into explored waters of templates, banality and infantilism. That is the resolution of the deceptive beginning but, actually, who cares about philosophy? All you need is lov… khe-khe... battles. Late on the arrival, final episodes reveal the true genre of Mob Physho ---: shōnen villain smasher, with all the typical flavourings. I wish I could distinguish Mob Phycho ---’s implementation from countless others… but can I really? Can you? And though I slightly enjoyed originality of the animation, was almost charmed by charisma of scallywag Reigen and laughed at a few jokes, that is definitely not enough to leave a mark on neither my heart, nor my brain.

I have been putting this review off for well over a year. 
I have been putting it off on purpose. 
I started Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann about half way through the season, and I finished Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann when the last episode aired.  I loved it. I know, 'why did he give this a low score if he loved it?' 
People deciding whether they will watch something or not skip all the tens, and look at all the low scores.  In the case of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I've selected a -, because it is the new benchmark by which I judge any anime with an outlandish story of grandeur. 
Story: --/--. Too many of these reviews incorrectly cite it is a story about beating the next strongest bad guy to become the strongest out there, or a simple 'coming of age' story.  I will not deny its base structure is a coming of age tale.  If it was just that however, no one would care. 
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a story about progress.  Not just for you yourself, not one person for other people, but progress in every sense.  It's critical theme is striving forward as much as you can so everyone after you can strive forward as well.  It is a story designed to really let you grasp that your successes are built on the progress of those around you and before you, and you are there to make progress for those coming after you. 
To break down story arcs, I must stress, watch through episode -.  My shoujo loving girlfriend trudged through this anime until episode -.  Then she finished it in two nights while having to deal with her full time job in the interim.  Episodes --- are so-so, even painful.  But, they set the tone.  Episodes ----- are one fluid, fast paced sequence of events.  Episode -- is a recap episode.  After the fast pacing of what happens from episodes ----, I don't blame them. 
Episodes ----- could be another show entirely.  I have never seen anything so wonderful as this arc of episodes. It is where this show gets most of my love, and it is where you understand why the characters in the first -- episodes don't get fleshed out as much as you might like to see them fleshed out.  You see it come to fruition here.  Warriors live the warrior life, friendships are proven again and again and again, and for these respected characters who came from nothing to a place where they have to carry everything for everyone, there is nothing but an understanding that people make way for more people, in an ever striving effort to move forward. 
Art: -/--. Weakest part of the show, almost made me want to turn it off during episode -.  Made it through that and watched the whole series the first time in one run.  As it goes along though, it steadily improves, and by the end you understand the art stylization suits it rather well.  It is not beautiful, but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is not beautiful.  It's truthful. 
Sound: -/--. Other than a few odd music selections from my perspective, the audio is critically amazing at supporting the action or the moment through and through. 
Character: -/--. Almost all of the characters show multidimensional behavior that fleshes out as the story progresses. If I ask someone cosplaying one of these characters to act like the character for an hour straight, they would have a difficult time expressing all sides to a character.  They are not easy to understand when you break down what they do and why they do it, but within the confines of the script, it is easy to see how they make the decisions they make. 
As to the complexity of the characters, no, there is not going to be some emo goth socially repressed bipolar homicidal bunny lover, but honestly, that is really not a good character.  Good characters are ones that you identify with people that you know in person, yet stand out apart from anyone you've ever met.  This means they've sold you on being human and real, yet being amazing and story worthy.  The reason why we follow a character is they are unlike any we've seen before. 
Enjoyment: --/--. I don't know why this is really a grading criteria.  This is what you decide after you've watched something, and is totally personal.  For me, this tale of a man's destiny was utterly enjoyable. 
In conclusion, I may cite - here, but for me inside this is a perfect --.  When you cross combine these elements, you create a perfect blend of balance and correctness that allows you to laugh, love, and cry.  I've seen plenty of anime, and my -'s on my anime list are probably your -'s.  This is a -- on that list.

Okay, I'll try this again. The last time my review got deleted but I will try it again this time. Leave a comment if you know WHY I like this anime. ;) 
Story --/-- 
Death Note is a fun anime, that's one thing for sure. I liked the plot a lot, just because the idea that such a notebook would excist, is awesome as hell. The pace was perfectly done as well, and every episode ended just where it should end. 
Art -/-- 
The most of the characters have a great design that fits them well. The background is dark and sort of depressing, and that fits the series great as well. I still give - points, because it was not completely perfect but still great. 
Sound -/-- 
This is for the Japanese dub, although I watched the English dub. and if I am honest, the Engelish dub would get -- points. The Japanese dub had just too less emotions, and the voices didn't fit the characters well. L's voice in the English dub was just perfect. I loved the music, and that's why I still give - out of --. 
Character --/-- 
I will be short abou this. I JUST LOVE FRIGGIN L AND LIGHT AND RYUK AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR DESIGN IS SO PERFECT AND THEIR ACTIONS ARE SO UNPREDICTABLE BUT STILL SO SUITABLE! Their actions are suitable with their designs, let I say it like that xD. 
Enjoyment --/-- 
I had fun the whole time with this anime. And all the jokes are timed so well. Just enjoyed the fact of the notebook with the rules that come by. It's so exciting! 
Overall --/-- 
Death Note is a anime worth your time, that's for sure. :)

Yup, here I am, hating that review a anime that everyone reviewed already. It's really late for this review, because I'm writing this review on Summer ---- anime season. First, let's talk about what I waited for, what I find. The most I waited for was Fate/Stay Night and Denpa Kyoushi for Spring ----. Plastic Memories was... in my -th, -th maybe ? Anyway, I didn't expected too much. I didn't even looked at it's categories, just looked at Isla, and said ""I'm going to watch this, don't know why... And boy don't look bad, story is good..."" Well, when I first watched first episode, it was already decided that it was going to end sad. Said myself that ""Brace Yourself, feels are coming!"" You can see as well. And... well, you watch the anime and see. Story contains some spoilers from episode -. Not much, only a few, really few.  
--Story-- 
Well, I can clearly say that this drama series can opposite even Angel Beats. Yup. I cried those two the most. Sorry, the anime that I cried most is Ano Hana. Anyways, story is good and goes well without boring the audience. Just for you guys know, story would have ended episode --, but they just remembered that ""Oh NO! We have - episodes more!"" and it's starting to bore. Because of this, I finished this anime yesterday. Just hang tight and watch it until end. But again, ""Brace Yourself, feels are coming!""... 
--Art-- 
It wasn't nice. I can watch ---- anime without saying that ""What's with this art ?"". But this art is ? Interesting. Hair is flashing in the middle, it's white. Okay, I don't care. No problem with Isla, her hair is good, her face is well drawn... But what's with that supporting characters ? It's so... so... I can't say it with words, go and watch. 
--Sound-- 
It was reaaaly good. Only problem with it, when happy moments, it's really bad. No good musics for happy moments huh ? But when it comes with sad moments, it's awesome, when you don't wanna cry, music says that ""You will cry!"" 
--Character-- 
Tsukasa is a boy, who does have a background, or not, we don't know, and who he is, we don't know, what he does, we don't know, what was he doing, we don't know... LOL. Character development is really bad, right ? Only character who has background is Michiru... Yeah. Only character with background is Michiru. No flashbacks on Main characters or supporting characters. Really, what is this?! In first episode, a guy says that ""You will work here, you can't hasitate bla bla"" I don't remember that well, and when you  come to final epsiode, waiting for it's explanation, it doesn't says a thing about it! Why is that Tsukasa must work there ?! You can't have a bond with characters because of this. Agh... 
--Enjoyment-- 
Only first -- episode I watch was enjoyable, other - is boring, final is... go watch it, i don't care. 
--Overall-- 
Plastic Memories is a good drama anime, it's awesome, but it lacks of character development. I tried my best to write it without spoilers, I really want to share with you that final episode is different from the other -- episodes. Final episode is doing what is other -- episodes need to do. Or it was for me. When I listen Plastic Memories ending, I feel that I created a bond with characters in final episode, and I developed empathy with Tsukasa while I don't want that. After watching the final episode, in first - minutes, you will know that you are going to cry. It's obvious. Well, enough with spoilers, Plastic Memories is a good drama anime. Not must watch, but maybe you want to watch it. Goodbye.

Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire -- episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
----------- 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my -/-- score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting --+ chapters into --.- episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into -- minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.

I am very late in reviewing this animation mainly because I had only heard about it from a random source and thought nothing of it at first. I am not normally a person who watches anime (animations out of artistic respect and courtesy) although I have watched plenty as a child. Now grown up I have become more picky and selective with my time and being a huge gamer, college student and worker I almost never watch shows anymore save for a few. So it speaks volumes that as an ""outsider"" I can say this show was one of the best and unexpected surprises for me in a long time. 
It's the daily sitcom style that many attribute as ""slice of life"" that focuses more on the characters instead of the plot. While this already can be a dealbreaker for some, the characters (mostly) keep the show great and increasing in emotion as it leads to a finale so much so that I think it's almost a none issue. The dragons that act as humans in a modern setting is a clear sort of parody to the quirky and odd that animation seems so engraved to have in that it almost doesn't work for the show. There is some sexual stuff that happens (not all in good taste) and some moments don't shine as they should, but the majority of the time there is so much energy and spirit put into the main characters like Tohru, Kobayashi and Kanna that I was sold by episode - for the whole series. 
As a critic for games and films, I tend to see animation on a art level that can give the viewer some sort of message to take away from, regardless of how unrealistic it could be. With dragons as women and men with all sorts of vibrancy that screams ""been there, done that"" with countless shows before it, it's honestly refreshing to see this energetic cast take off to keep my attention. The pacing can sometimes be a bit too fast for jokes to land a hit, but I was ranging from chuckles to laughter when I caught onto the subtle even deadpan delivery by the characters. As a comedy, it retains a high quality of humor that uses gags effectively by cleverly redesigning the buildup so it remains fresh. How long before they stale entirely is uncertain, but the gags currently all work fine.  
The cast is superb with voicework of Tohru, Kanna and Kobayashi all deserve particular praise. Despite the comedy and energetic vibrancy the show gives, there is also a really precious theme swimming through its veins. It's a show that made me smile, even sometimes tear up on how beautiful things can be when portrayed through a medium such as animation. The best part I think of that is only the viewer will only know that warm feeling you get when you see certain scenes happen. It's a personal commitment that rewards the viewer as much as those on screen. The pacing is great with no setbacks or overuse of filler that wastes the potential of the characters. The music (as it is subjective as much as comedy) is very alluring. The opening is initially simple, but grows to be far more emotional and deep as you progress through each episode and the closing is silly yet charming. 
I enjoyed this a great deal. I was enthralled by the artwork of the characters and dialogue. The finale filled me with tears and was near flawless in its execution. The need for a second season is critical as I feel some of the criticisms of certain characters need to be explained more so it can further their appeal. Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid deserves acclaim for it's accomplishments in sticking to a formula used often and throws a completely random and yet clever twist that works to the show's strengths. As I mentioned, I might not watch much animation as I use to, but with a much better understanding of art, critique and analyzing, there is no doubt that this show is a winner in my books. Watch it if you want a happy, funny and emotional time that is straight to the point and pulls off the surface level facades anyone might have when looking at this for the first time.

This one hits me a little on the emotional side, because being an expat I see these turmoils in life (not fitting in), which is a slight reason I give this anime more importance and I may have a sight bias towards it. But anyhow, 
Hachiman isn't your average main character, unlike NHK's MC he isn't trying to overcome his predicament of not fitting in, he is aware of it though. Unlike Log Horizon's MC he isn't gifted with wits, though they both have a commonality in giving someone else the credit for all they have done, because the other person is more charismatic and thus fits what society believes. What this MC has is practicality, he is realistic, and defines the world as a pessimistic world. Although for some reason I feel like he has great faith in it, but I can't back this.  
Throughout the story he will tackle problems (social) and provide solutions and what is annoying is that in real life that is how it would go down. You won't get action from this anime nor will it get you jumping out of your seat, but you will enjoy it because of how well it flows and makes you think. 
In terms of romance, even though it is tagged with it and has it in its name, it is very slight, if it is even there. And when it will come it might turn this whole anime around as it may interfere with some friendships, this is no harem that is for sure, so there must be conflict, so that might be interesting to watch too. 
The other MC is Yukino, she is smart, beautiful and pretty much perfect and thus ostracized by society and again is aware of her situation and thus just mocks human society openly, for its cruelty.  
The third MC (Yui) is a direct contrast to both of them. She is normal, in all ways. And that is her role. I don't exactly know how else to describe her. 
This anime will be far from boring, it might not be a favorite for everyone, but it is definitely worth a shot. It has content.

I usually check the reviewers&rsquo; anime compatibility to see if I'm likely to enjoy the anime or not. One of the highest compatibility to this anime was --.-% which should have flagged me early on since they've ALL given it high ratings. So I'm writing a small review simply to add yet another one. To warn off people. 
I'd like to say that I've watched the series and what I liked the most, was probably the story. 
But this movie is bad. Really bad. 
They've completely ruined the story. 
They haven't changed the art in any way. It&rsquo;s more or less a hideous AMW of the series. 
The sound was so-so. 
They've made the characters out as either insane or emo. 
Unfortunately, I don't like the things I wrote above. So the enjoyment was pathetic. 
Even if it receives so many -s, I'll give it a - because I COULD imagine something worse. Even though it's hard to.

Prior to the initial airing of [C], I was really hyped for it because the director attached to it was Kenji Nakamura. Other notable anime on his resume were Mononoke and Trapeze (Kuchuu Buranko) and both were really good anime. They were eccentric, visually stunning, well executed pieces of animation. Most importantly it really highlighted Nakamura’s diversity as a director since Mononoke was at heart a mystery series with slight horror elements and Trapeze was an eccentric comedy about people with mental disorders. The only real element they shared was a sense of surreality. Then we got rumors of [C]: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control, a supposed anime that dealt with topics related to the state of the current economy in a battle anime-esque way.  This was totally the kind of anime I thought Nakamura would direct since the premise sounded fresh and original and it was in the noitaminA timeslot which basically meant that the concept of the show wouldn’t be gutted in favor of appealing to a broader audience. The only real notable difference here was that the production studio was Tatsunoko, where Mononoke and Trapeze were done by Toei. I didn’t really think this would be a big factor in the larger scheme of things so I brushed it aside and began getting immensely hyped. And at the end of this little rainbow all I ended up with was a pot of bitter disappointment and frustration. [C] doesn’t fall short of Mononoke or Trapeze, it runs off a cliff and gets impaled on the rocks below. Not only is it disappointing in that regard but it doesn’t even manage to have many redeeming aspects, if any at all.  
Now let’s deal with the least offensive part of [C] and that’s the plot. The premise involves a student named Yoga trying to tough out the hard times and getting through life in an economy that seems to working against everyone. Cutting corners to save costs, working multiple jobs and getting good grades on top of that, yeah none of us are ever really ready to deal with the hurdles that comes with pursuing tertiary education after high school. Let’s not even deal with romance and finding a girlfriend/boyfriend in addition. This is one of the few things [C] does right and that’s creating an initially relatable main character that the audience can sympathize with. Unfortunately that’s where the good things stop with [C], the premise and the first episode is probably the best part of the show and I’m not kidding at all. We then get to the meat of the story and that involves a magical dimension in the middle of the city called the “Financial District” where people fight out battles called “Deals” with pokem-err I mean“Assets”. If they win they get some Midas Money and if they lose, their future disappears. Now in terms of actual plot, [C] has a bunch of pacing issues and a narrative that goes nowhere until the last couple of episodes. Everything the audience needs to know is given to us in the first two episodes and the driving force of the plot only shows up at the end. There’s a good flashback episode in the middle but that’s pretty much character related. You have a good chunk of the middle which revolves around Yoga fighting other people and their story but ultimately none of this stuff ever adds anything to the narrative. You could argue that they’re there to characterize Yoga but that’s pointless since Yoga doesn’t grow as a character throughout the show. They play on the redundant “What am I fighting for/What do I want to protect” theme that nearly every anime arbitrarily slaps on to characters they don’t know what to do with. There’s also a concurrent plotline that deals with Yoga’s dad but even that is done in a half-assed way. You have Yoga agonizing over several episodes on why his dad supposedly abandoned his family when the whole goddamn answer is so obvious in the first place. The way Yoga treats it as an epiphany is even more annoying, really why would a father ever fight to win money? COULD IT POSSIBLY BE BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY? But nah that answer is too high-brow for the audience, might as well pad it out for a couple of episodes. It’s such lazy way of delivering a frankly boring plot point anyway especially since Yoga doesn’t learn anything from it. To make things even worse, Yoga never ends up doing anything on his own accord. Even at the end, he’s fighting because someone else told him to, not because he reached that answer himself. That’s the problem of creating a character based on a motive like “Protecting something” without any real elaboration. Yoga comes off as nothing but the standard battle shounen lead except it’s played completely straight. He’s barely a character on his own and whatever possibilities there are initially end up being completely wasted.  
Speaking of other major characters, the only other remotely interesting one is the series antagonist, Mikuni. He contrasts Yoga’s blind sheep idealism with a stark amount of pragmatism. He drives all the action in the plot and has the most characterization out of the entire cast. Honestly I believe that [C] was initially written with Mikuni as the main character instead of Yoga, yet in order to make the anime more appealing they had to shoehorn a younger character in because lol anime. If you check out some of the groundwork on [C], most of the concept art and notes focus on Mikuni. On the other hand Msyu, Masakaki and Jennifer are just walking archetypes with one gimmick they play over and over again in place of actual characterization. The only other memorable supporting characters are the professor and the charity worker but they’re only around for an episode and again, they don’t add anything to overall narrative. This is a problem since the show has an overarching plot yet it tries to be almost episodic and these different narrative structures clash horribly.  Generally the writing is the definition of mediocre. It’s got some good ideas, but never elaborates on them and whatever aspects it does elaborate on are wholly uninteresting.  Also there is virtually no economics in this anime, unless you count naming attacks “Micro, Macro or Mezzo” economics related. It tries to use this angle to cover up just how shallow the entire battles are. There’s a bit with hyperinflation at the end yet it doesn’t make any sense in the context it’s used in. If you’re expecting something like Spice & Wolf, don’t bother since [C] uses fantasy economics because it’s a battle anime that fails at making any relevant or meaningful social commentary. 
Possibly the most damning aspect of [C] is the animation, composition and general scene layout. Even if [C] has some lackluster and boring writing, it still could have been a decent watch if the visual fidelity was on the level of the Nakamura’s previous works. Yet in the end, [C] had some of the worst cinematography I’ve seen in an anime in quite a while. The cuts and composition for each scene are not just bland or boring, they’re awkward and jarring. You have a cut of Yoga and Msyu fighting someone else and we’re getting to the climactic end yet THE FUCKING SHOW DECIDES TO CUT AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT AND PROCEDES TO SHOW THE AFTERMATH. Really. Now yes, this style was used in Mononoke and Trapeze but it had significance there. The jarring cuts in those shows were there to play off of their quirky and artsy visual style AND most importantly they built tension in Mononoke (because it had strong mystery and horror aspects) and those same cuts really magnified the surrealism and comedy in Trapeze. It has no place being in [C], because this anime’s composition is incredibly plain. You’ll have cuts of Yoga walking across the street yet we see it cut to him being on one side, in the middle than at the other side with not much animation in between. It has no meaning and it’s obviously there to hide whatever shoestring budget this anime was made on. Truthfully Mononoke and Trapeze didn’t have great animation either yet they hid that with clever scene layouts, angles and composition. Mononoke for example still had some breathtaking cuts that were animated beautifully. Just compare the last five minutes of its fifth episode to all of [C], the difference is like night and day. Not only that but [C]’s animation is genuinely terrible, the laughable running cut in the first fight should tip you off, or rather smack you over the head with it. All the fights have bad animation; I cannot understand why they would want to make a battle show if they didn’t want to spend money on it. There were some cuts done by notable animators such as Sushio and Ryochimo but in the end their cuts only exemplified how bad the scene layouts and storyboards were. Even their animation didn’t make any of the fights more interesting or exciting. Ironically enough, it seems all the good animation was saved for the final episode and while it’s alright, it still doesn’t excuse the utter mediocrity of the other -- episodes.  
To top it all off, [C] has some atrocious aesthetics. The character designs are bland and uninspired, and the color palette clashes with the CGI work (incredibly frustrating since Mononoke had just as much CGI but the difference was that [C]’s is a fucking pink elephant in the room). You have entire cuts that are done in CGI, even the characters and it sticks out like a sore thumb. There really is no excuse for such poor visual fidelity, it’s fairly obvious that Tatsunoko did not give Nakamura the creative liberty he had with his previous works and they also gave him a pretty bad staff to work with. The musical score is non-existent except for in the last couple of episodes and the voice-work only makes the characters more lifeless than they already are.   
So after all those bitter tears, is [C] worth watching? No, especially if you’re watching this because of Nakamura. I admit, I’m being biased against it because I had lofty expectations yet [C] never becomes anything more than mediocre in all of its -- episodes. The writing is contradictory, the visuals are horrible, and so it doesn’t really do anything that deserves praise. If you want an intelligent fighting anime, you’re not gonna find it here. Hell if you want something quirky and Nakamura-esque, you’ll definitely leave this anime with a bad taste in your mouth.

STORY: 
In most anime's it takes a few episodes to get into it, but Zetsuen no Tempest is actually pretty easy to follow. In the first few episode I was really curious to know who killed Mahiro's sister. I think that is the ONLY mystery of the whole serie. That was the only reason why I kept watching. The serie adds unrealistic aspects to the story (flying fruits, revival ceremony etc.). It's just - trees that are in war with eachother. The way the story is put together is not strong and not plausible. Therefore when I found out who killed Aika, I lost interest. The killer suposed to be the big twistplot, but it even made it more lame. Adding quotes of Shakespeare could be interesting but in this case it was getting more and more annoying.  
I did like how they potray Hakaze as a typical girl who is in love, and Mahiro as the typical guy who seeks revenge.  
OVERALL: 
The summary made me curious, but it really was unrealistic. It reminds me of ""Mawaru Penguindrum"" where - guys fight for the sake of a girl and has a random element in it.  In this case the treemagic.  It's not worth the watch if you're looking for a good story.

When watching this show I ponder on what it really means to “Falling into the Hype”. 
It is naïve to think that when a show is popular that it doesn’t effect your mood going in.  
But on that same thought is there a difference in “Falling into the Hype” and just seeking understatement on why something is popular.  
I didn’t come into this show hyped but throughout this experience I was always search for that special something.  
Something I never found. All I was left was this indifferent feeling.  
When you are stuck in an indifferent feeling is a good indication that the show is average. 
It is tasked upon you at that point to go through all the aspects of the show and see what would you say is above average and if that is enough to warrant putting up the score.  
When I asked about this show before I started watching my comrades noted there was a lot of mentioning of economics. 
That is definitely something that caught my attention and was the most enjoyable plot about the show. 
I actually wrote a paper in college all about merchant guilds and having an anime that covered it was satisfying but only to a certain extent.  
We saw glimpses of the trade warfare going on but it wasn’t a full-fledged dive into the economic wars of the world.  
I would personally like to see a show about merchant guilds that would operate more like -- Days.  
There was no individuality given to any of the guilds.  
The merchant guilds were primarily there to only put hardships on our main character Lawrence.  
A character that I have to say am disappointed in as he was fairly bland the entire entry.  
There were glimpses at the end that showed he could improve in the second season. But he needs to drop the White Knight act.  
Then even as a businessman I can’t respect him as I don’t know who in their right mind would put all their money in one basket instead of building up a contingency.  
There is no time in this show where I can definitively say I felt bad for him. 
When Holo calls this guy a loser. She isn’t wrong. 
Holo is the best character of the show by default but still isn’t exactly my type of girl. 
I have seen a lot of individuals deeming Lawrence and Holo to be one of the best couples in all of anime. 
Yet the romance in this season has barely even been scratched. I would hope in the second season there would be much improvement.  
But as for the first season we’ve only seen Tsundere flirting. That is nowhere near enough for me.  
Then we move on the supernatural element of the show.  
I really liked the opening the show and the world it was attempting to create in episode - about Holo’s origins. 
But all of that was downgraded to a side story and an unfulfilling one at that.  
There was all this talk about the people believing they didn’t need Holo anymore to bless their crops. 
But because of everything else going on in the show the climax to that just fell flat.  
I wouldn’t even put that into the importance of the currency wars that was noted throughout the season.  
Having rivaling currencies was very intriguing aspect to follow. 
But when the economics changed over to just being there for hardships on Lawrence we lost that flare there as well.  
What it comes down to is can I say that anything about this show was fulfilling? The answer would be no.  
The OP and ED are good but nothing I would put in my top --.  
The Art is good but nothing I’d rave about.  
I’m giving those - out of -- but there is nothing amazing there for me to want to bump up the score.  
I will also note that I felt the pacing was rushed for the plot. There was also time for more plot that was taken up by slice of life episodes.  
Finally I do find it ironic that even in the moment of writing this review. My feeling on this review of the show reflects my opinions on show. Indifferent.

The story is fine. However too much effort is wasted on ecchi and some slow motion you-know-what part. -/-- 
Shinichirou is like a support character, simply there to resupply the energy of the girls. 
Nothing to complement/complain about the sound or music. 
The art is done quite nicely but I can only give a maximum of -/-- for it because the whole battle scene is basically censored thanks to all those ecchi and seinen contents. 
The action + seinen combination in this anime is one of the worst I've seen. Also, whats with that ending?! It felt like - episodes or more being cut off directly. Overall -/-- with tons of question marks in my mind what the heck I just watched.

Okay, there comes a time when you might begin to take animes too seriously. You see yourself overthinking events that occur or you take characters words seriously and begin to reflect on them. This eventually becomes REALLY tiring later on.I took Beelzebub as a breadth of fresh air from all this seriousness and I found meself VERY entertaining and relaxing anime. 
You must have read the synopsis, so you can guess what its about. The execution however is amazing!!! Surprisingly, this anime develops a really nice plot as the show progresses and there are tons of funny moments to keep you smiling throughout half the show. 
I really enjoyed this anime because its really funny, has interesting characters and a pretty decent story to boot. Watch this if you feel like relaxing :-)

Full Metal Panic! is the light-hearted story of a military teen with aspergers syndrome who teams up with a high school girl with ADHD and hilarity ensues.  
At least that would be the story if there were no robots in it. 
This anime fits the bill of being your typical high-school-romantic-comedy with the only major difference being that it's also a mecha anime. The story mostly revolves around the two characters Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori. 
Sousuke I-got-a-stick-up-my-ass Sagara is a mercenary working for the top secret military organization MITHRIL who has been assigned to protect Kaname from a host of terrorists and governments who want to kidnap her. Part of what makes the comedy in this story is the fact that as a hardened military veteran at the age of seventeen Sousuke's understandably unable to cope with civilian life in a High School setting. Though when it comes to social etiquette and cues he seems so dense that light appears to bend around him. Not only that, but his military discipline seems to make him so uptight he'd shit diamonds if you fed him enough coal for a week. The writers on this series tend to overplay these two aspects of the character way too much unintentionally making him the most socially retarded protagonist since Shinji Ikari. 
Kaname I-just-did-a-line-of-coke Chidori is the ala cart Tsundere girl in the series. So high-maintenance that she crosses into total-bitch territory a few times, her job is to adjust Sousuke to the peaceful life of Japan while making sure both of them don't get killed in the process. She is selfish, vain and very self-conscience. So, basically your typical high-school girl. Her manic behavior would be a major turn off if it weren't for the fact that she is also extremely good looking. Like Sousuke, the novelty of her character runs out of steam quickly and almost makes you wish Sousuke would just throw her to the wolves so as not to deal with her incessant harping. 
Though I do give this anime a lot of shit I will concede the fact that the concept is pretty decent as well as the terrorist sub-plots throughout. I'll also mention that I do in fact like the manga which is what got me to watch the anime in the first place. However, Sousuke and Kaname, two of the major pillars that make Full Metal Panic! an action-comedy both fail to deliver on the comedy part (no thanks to the writers). The jokes eventually become self-referential and go from being the selling point to the crutch of the show, much like a dog gnawing on it's own leg to get out of a bear trap.  
I give this one a five out of ten if only for trying to combine mecha, romance and high school comedy into one show, despite in my opinion failing at doing both and unfortunately creating a total mediocrity as a result. This also is because it falls into the category among anime fans of either being totally awesome or a bag of shit. Truth be told it's somewhere in the middle. Love may bloom on the battle field with this one, but watch out: it's a flower that comes with thorns.

What were my first thoughts on Kuragehime? It sounds stupid. An anime about middle aged lonely otaku virgin women is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. None of them are even cute! ‘Give me moe or give me death!’ is quite a common thing nowadays. And above all it’s just another slice of life. Almost nothing is attractive if you were to just explain ‘The Jellyfish Princess’ to any other fan.  
However, despite all its unattractiveness it is by far the most beautiful anime of the fall season. 
At first glance, without being told anything, anyone would assume the majority of the main characters were guys. This would include Mayaya, Banba and Jiji. Quite honestly those names are some of the strangest names I’ve heard in all the years I’ve watched anime. Coupled with their rather quirky nature and almost unisexual apparel you’d almost never guess they were girls until the show told you and if all you’re looking for is moe you’d be hugely disappointed. However their personalities, now factoring Tsukimi and Chieko, seem to overcome all those faults. I’m not sure if it’s the obsessive otakuness that drives their actions but the characters seem endearing; you can laugh at them, with them, and even understand why they act the way they do. All the NUNZ are just fun and somewhat loveable to watch as they interact with the ‘Hipster’ Kuranosuke.  
Kuranosuke is, currently, my most favorite character of the series. He’s that annoying crossdressing neighbor that runs into your life and does whatever he wants, typically destroying any semblance of piece. Aside from being completely hilarious, he’s the main reason the plot moves at all and without him I don’t think the everyday lives of the NUNZ would have been hilariously affected as they are now. 
In short, the main attraction to this series, I would believe, would be the characters. But not in the same way a show like K-ON attracts using their characters. While K-ON has you admire and squeal over how cute their characters act, Kuragehime has characters that live by quirks many otaku and others without good people skills would find familiar and easy to understand.  
All in all, don’t let the description throw you off. Let it take you in and you’ll find Kuragehime, among its faults, shines as bright as the brightest jellyfish at night. 
PS: Don’t listen to the OP or ED. They’re so addictive it’s hard to sleep while knowing they aren’t in your hard drive RIGHT NOW.

What do you get when you decide to put all the taboos that people suffer from, a seasonal anime and magic? Magical Girl Site. Shows generally don't make me feel like vomiting on my keyboard or wondering who even did the story for this, but I found one that does all of the above. 
Story - A bunch of girls who've suffered abuse, grooming, mental illness or something tragic. Our first MC Aya is bullied, neglected at home and abused by her brother to the point she tries to commit suicide. This show could've taken a better direction into her escaping the situation, starting afresh somewhere where she won't be found or even using the gun to her advantage, but she stays in it. Things uh, go up and down throughout the show, but they do get worse. Lots of gore and shock value in every lasting minute of each episode too. Edge. 
Characters - We have Aya who's already been mentioned, her close friend who's parents got murdered and she now tortures the guy who did it, a murderer, someone who wants to murder the murderer for killing her best friend, bullies, early on a pimp or something, girl who does self harm as her magical power and a narcissistic, delusional psychopath brother who abuses his sister and thinks he's a god. More edge. 
Enjoyment - I didn't enjoy it - its disgusting, rancid and basically uses stuff people suffer from lightly and throws in gore and super powers to go with it. Could even call it glorifying taboos. 
Overall - Don't watch it if you haven't. If you want a good magical girl with a dark plot watch Magica Madoka, its much better than this show in every way. I have so many questions after - episodes and I'm not going to finish for obvious reasons.

""I always begin to inspect the anime, even if I did not like"" this proposal is 
anime Bokura ga ita 
In other words a waste of time on useless characters - children and their inclinations emovskih 
(All bad, he does not love me, etc.) 
Start honestly intrigued me, because I have always liked romance, do not know if the creators 
confused her, instead of romantic melodrama, they have done ""a la Santa Barbara"", whether it is anime constructed 
only for girls who love this genre and from that strange and appreciation of the anime ... 
Story: - (boy, girl meet, then parted, then again there are - for mneya is quiet 
horror of snot and confusing emotions) 
Art: - (The most terrible show-off that I've seen, although I do not care for showing off extreme, but constantly 
closed bangs when they have problems and not middle of painting the characters of the second plan, it is my vyvorazhivaet) 
Sound: - (tedious music, all I can say) 
Character: - (I do not understand the nature of these characters, I can kind of person who over trifles 
do not survive, and if there was love, you can find another, but probably not destiny) 
Enjoyment: - (It was a feeling of ""When will it end, and when finally one of the protagonist'll bet 
girl and make her truly happy? ! !) 
Overall: - No comment

A bizarre world building ended a tragic and epitome of disjointed plot 
As referring set of tragedy events behind the story which lies under the beneath catalyst breach of such unspoken some more less detail never detain an interior crappy edgy tone vibes. 
In depths between an example of Dante's Comedy but with a common poison 
A structure which bases on an imagining contents in a form of writing directs  
unnecessary gibberish drawn out of context grandiose tale without based to the point of existentialism behind the drastic factual and careful disregarded recyclable setting. Not only it has a shallow mediocre material, but tells neutral status rather than taking some components on every aspects that depicts on a massive downgrade fantasy series. Such as political struggling issues on the deaths between set of characters for having a severe breakdown. 
The writing in this book is decent for the most part. It struggles in the dialogue department at times, coming off as rather clunky in a few areas when it introduces a character and awkwardly explains what they’re about to characters who already know (see Suou’s introduction). Otherwise, I found the dialogue pretty decent enough. It presents us with a redeeming setting wrapped in a coat of luscious, beautiful artwork that is an eyed candy to our eyes, But It lacks a strong cast currently and its pace may be more of a hindrance than a benefit to some horrifying, but fascinating to look at and ponder. Not bogging you down in the detail and bringing them in one at a time. The pacing is quick and while I find that hurts the story, it can be a benefit for those who just want to get straight to the point. Plus, things are easy to follow and never feel that confusing even despite the characteristics, It felt cringe enough to width the amount of parts by being left in a mark. 
From the verge of the existence in between the stellar art and beauty 
intertwine a vision had caught in a blink state of morality. And was also left a complete anticlimatic attempt as it never reach to it's mere type of conclusion. Stereotypes are never felt biased and failed to deepen a crucial focus on what's life is normally like on the Mud Whale. This doesn’t necessarily hurt the series much, Neither pacing didn’t do its justice, by showing characters, or plot any favor. It probably would have been more essential where exploiting a desirous on began challenging the unbearable of living and anticipating the less aesthetic human nature.

I don't I love Danganronpa its an amazing fun game, something I never played before. The second game is my favorite and I am hoping the third is amazing to. I just love the characters these characters are amazing, its just amazing with the reveals of them being the villians, its pretty interesting..... then theres this anime. 
I watched the first bit - episodes. Now thats it finished I was to lazy to watch all -- because I don't want these characters ruined for me. I heard a lot of bad things about this seen a lot of cool and dumb scenes. I don't know its just dropped instantly for me.  
The story is so screwed up beacuse they force in the future side to. So the whole thing of having A LOT of stuff in despair and future side. Is a problem. Like theres just to much. I just skipped right to the end nothing special. I don't know, Danganronpa they could of done a great story then a back story before the third game comes out. It would of made more money and even the spin off game if that got an anime. Its really not that hard, but of course they add in EVEN THE SPIN OFFS are in the future side. Its just a mess. 
Its sad to see a good game genre (not perfect) go down the drain because of the animes. If you are reading this and you haven't played the games. Please do they are way better then this.

Digimon Adventure, the anime of my childhood - rewatched the entire two seasons just to watch the movies. 
When I heard, that there will be a Movie, continuing the ORGINIAL(!!!) Digimon series, I really looked forward to it. The first movie was okay the second not so well and this... this movie disappointed me so much, I can't describe my anger. 
First, the stupid animation I can't stand. It is like every other ""kawaii"" anime (eg Kyoto animation animes), it losts his charmness.  
When I think back to the old season, the adults looked like adults and not like kids. You can see, that they are low in budget and this is fine, but an anime lost his seriousness, when adults looking like childrens. 
Second, the new character doesn't make me angry, but the fact that she has the same name as her digimon, makes me cringe. Evertime Mimi calls her makes me cringe. 
Third, Mimi isn't the same anymore. She was charming and friendly, but in this movie Mimi just want to pick up a fight with Izzy for no reason. I know that the author wants Love drama, but you can't just put drama in a scene where it doesn't belong.  
Fourth, there isn't a real plot now. It takes to long. This and the last movie dropped the niveau of Digimon completly. 
Fifth, whats up with Sora and Yamato? In the last Digimon Adventure episodes Sora told Yamato that she loves her, and when the Digimon attacked the human world, you can see, how Yamato protects Sora. In the movie you can not tell if they are a pair, or if Sora has feelings for Tai. 
The only thing I enjoyed is, that they keep their old soundtracks and opening theme. 
All in all the characters aren't as charming as they where in the first movie and in the old seasons, but I am looking forward and I hope that it will be better.

A- Picture is back at it again, with lowest common denominator entertainment…. but I kind of enjoyed it this time. Blend S is not a good show that explores the human psyche but it neither is an insultingly bad show or one that is boring. I think the main Issue is that the show isn’t really capturing the zeitgeist of slice of life and decided to be kind of dull. Slice of Life anime’s are about growth and character interaction. This show is completely one note in that regard. None of them felt like they grown as a character or have that much of an interesting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely. Of course this isn’t to say that all slice of life should be about growth theres plenty out there that is good that isn’t “Mangaka and His Assistant”, “D-Frag” or “Oshiete Galko-Chan” are prime examples of that. But those shows are far funnier and had some interesting dynamics in the show that kept it above from the rest. 
Blend S is an anime based on the manga of the same name. The show is similar to Working and Is This Order a Rabbit, where it is mostly work slice of life that takes place in a café/restaurant. The show centres around Maika a High School girl, who got a job in a “wacky maid café” where all the girls plays an anime quirk whetter it’s tsundere, little sister, or an Idol.  Which is an interesting concept and they even played with it being that the jokes centre in their clashing personality of each of the character and the quirk they play. Kaho is a sweet heart who has to play a tsundere, Mafuyu is a stone faced mature -- year old who has to play a little sister etc etc. This is all fine and good but though I chuckle and even laugh once or twice, a level of growth or anything interesting done with it. The jokes in the end were just “ HAHAHA KAHO HAS TITS” or “HAHAHAHAH MAFUYU IS A LOLI”. Which plays in the biggest issue this show has the show lacked so much personality. Though I think the characters are fine, I feel a majority is kind of one note the exception being Mafuyu and Maika.  The are a lot of wasted potential here an example would be Kaho and Akizuki, who are shown to have somewhat an on screen romance, but it never went anywhere. Akizuki is a fish eyed weeb whos awkward around women and Kaho is a cheerful beautiful weeb who spends all of her time playing games but is also a massive scaredy cat. They did play with it here and there. But they were forgettable, and the dialogue they share wasn’t interesting. It wasn’t, as funny and intelligent like in Lucky Star where the dialogue felt like satire or as memorable and cutthroat like in Bakemonogatari. Overall it just felt dull. The main character though not completely one note didn’t really grow on me, she was the most boring character I the fray. As her arch of wanting to learn about other culture was barely mentioned and her romance with the manager Dino which had some pretty funny moments such as when Dino was arrested for when he got to close to Maika. Felt manufactured, its your typical “Oh he’s in love with me…. Oh I’m tooo dense to notice hahahah tehehe~” It was disappointing to say the least. The show could have benefited greatly if it stopped emulating popular tropes and instead playing around with it. The beach episode was one of the worst beach episodes; it was just dull and insultingly boring, the side characters were also a huge let down. To the shows credit however, I want bored at least not all the time. Most of the time I feel the show had a little bit charm into it, its dull and repetitive with them repeating the same joke just with a little variety. But part of it has grown on me and some episodes aren’t as bad as the others. I like the part where Mafuyu talks about relationship and her interaction with the cast. I think Kaho and Akizuki though I’ve mention to be kind off dull. I think has some potential into it. 
Animation wise, its pretty, A- picture the cancer of the studio they are can make some good visuals, though not very interesting it’s at least pleasing to the eyes. I particularly like how they animate Mafuyu and Hideri. Character design wise ill give them prop a majority of them I do like. Mafuyu, Maika and Kaho are pretty design though a little uninspired they have interesting facial expressions and overall I find kind of a good blend (Pun not intended) of interesting design choices. Note Kaho is like incredibly hot and Mafuyu is like incredibly cute while Maika is kind of a sweet spot design where it just kind of works. 
Music wise its……. serviceable no pun intended. Though its not all over the place like some other A- shows, it’s definitely not catchy or memorable. It goes for the OP and E. D was kind of disappointed I expected better. Voice acting is pretty good; it features a lot of newcomers, though I do feel the Seiyou for Akizauki and Miu can pretty bad. With Miu a lot of the times I kind of wished she more of memorable voiced, but in the end it felt so boring and even when she’s being a perv she doesn’t really do much with her vocal range. With Akizuki it was ok but anyone could have played this role. If this anime’s goal was to build new seiyou stars, then it failed. None but a few of the cast really showed their range or show how unique their voice. I think the show could have benefited from having Veteran seiyous on the show voicing the supporting characters.  
Is it a bad show definitely not there’s moments that I genuinely laugh or even chuckle a little. There’s no one particularly annoying or even insultingly bad. The show is not great or even good. But its definitely not a bad time waster or a good laugh or even an introduction to slice of life that isn’t too slow….. Just don’t expect to come out of it completely satisfied. The show was too busy emulating what was popular it never became it’s own thing and if it wasn’t for the Meme it spawned I don’t think anyone would bat an eye watching it. I came in the show with low expectation and I wasn’t blown away but I wasn’t horrified with what I find. Overall it’s ok; personally check out the show I mention in the first paragraph instead, but if you find the show entertaining I get it, the wacky and warm setting is still welcomed but in the sea of anime this is one that isn’t special or anything. I’m feeling a decent - to a Hard - on this.

Synopsis: Hikaru stumbles upon an old Go board that is haunted by a ghost named Sai. Prompted by Sai's request, Hikaru begins playing Go and meets Touya, his eventual rival. 
Hikaru no Go is one manga/anime series that I will always, always love no matter what. To begin with, it was one of the first shounen mangas I ever read then subsequently watched the anime. To this day, I'll still say that both the manga and the anime is worth the time to read and watch (I try to always read the original work first before watching any adaptions). 
In terms of content, HnG had some great character development, for our hero and the side characters as well. In the world of Go, finding friends, facing rivals, working through relationships, and so on, is such a pleasure. I'm pretty sure that for most readers and watchers, they aren't familiar with Go or can make any sort of initial connection to it. But that is what makes HnG so special. It takes a completely different and unknown subject and connects the readers and watchers through the characters. You, as the audience, become invested in the characters; their wins and losses, their troubles, and their connection to each other through Go. 
What I also enjoyed immensely (and this is what I love so much about shounen manga/anime in general) is the style/art development. Most of the time, especially with the shounen genre, the mangaka will have a (hopefully) long series with unending chapters. Unsurprisingly, you will find that mangaka's art changes, develops, gets better and sharper throughout the chapters. This occurs within the manga and also therefore within the anime. And I wont lie: I like eye-pleasing art and this mangaka's art definitely suits me. 
The musical track to the anime was well suited. It made moments full of unbelievable tension or incredible humor shine. And the voice actors (Japanese only (I never watch dubbed anime, personal preference), and yes, super important) were incredible in their roles. They matched their characters exactly! 
Bottomline: the story will capture you until you, like me, will regret when the adventure is over.

This series is one thing, one simple thing... 
SPECTACULARLY OVERRATED 
Overall - this series has a lot of potential, a comedic parody of shouen anime. However, the execution of this series is very poor. 
Story - There is little to no discernible story line it seems, and whatever is there is needless drawn out and fraught with cliche, that more or less parody shouen story-lines, but without providing any actual comedy. Basically turning into a shitty version of what they are trying to make fun of. 
Art/Sound - Only redeeming element of this anime, the art style is fantastic and it comes with a very good audio quality, the voice acting is about average. 
Characters - Characters in this series tend to come off as extremely bland, and boring. This is quite a shame since the design and back story's of these characters are very interesting. This combined with decent voice acting should provide a decent set of characters. However, it doesn't this time, and it is very disappointing   
In conclusion - This is a very disappointing series, fantastic art and sound combine with an awful story and lackluster characters make this series just disheartening and one of the most boring anime I have ever seen

story: -/-- 
The story is really great, we got introduced to our protagonist hei without really knowing a lot of things of him. his intentions and his history remains hidden till later so we get a air of mystery in him. the series work around sets of two episodes feacturing some mini-stories. 
Art: -/-- 
While not my favorite type of art, it doesnt bothers me. actually is quite good but nothing outstanding. 
sound: -/-- 
Same here nothing outstanding. the music was good but nothing so catchie that i wanted to learn to play it or get the song. 
characters --/-- 
The series really shines over here, each character has a incredible story behind. mabie the only lack would be that some of them didnt get  enought time for their arc :/ 
enjoyment: -/-- 
i really enjoyed this series, maybe not enought to say it is one of the best series ever made but still outstanding. 
Overall: -/--

First of all when i almost finished watching this it gave me a feeling that this anime is so incomplete.i felt disappointed when i search the manga version of it is still ongoing and on that point i knew that there's something missing in the end of the anime but to be honest this anime is pretty entertaining and very funny at the same time.It follows a young girl Kyoko to get revenge on his childhood friend Fuwa in the celebrity industry it may have many cliché moments and yet interesting for some reason to me its a fun anime to watch if you need a daily dose of laugh.

Don’t be fooled by appearances! Onara Gorou is high art; a masterful, deeply deconstructive analysis of a long-held social taboo! It alters one’s perspective on its cultural significance, exploring such themes as fart romance and the meaning of life for digestive gases, and using these themes to demonstrate poignant, thought-provoking truths… 
…What’s that? You think I’m talking out of my ass? Pffffft! 
From the creator of such marvels as “Mr. Andou of the Forest” and “Salaryman Man” comes anime’s latest avant-garde classic! It follows the adventures of troubled individuals, who see their lives turned around as they get lectured by an old fart and his heroic inanimate smiling sidekick – the true unsung hero, perhaps, for enabling such great deeds to happen while asking for no praise or even name recognition in return! This character is so deep, he contains another entire character that still seems like hot air by comparison! To top it all off, there's even a farewell catchphrase to go with it all! 
“Defart!” (“Sayo-onara!”) 
I’ll admit, I got some chuckles out of this one, and one or two were legitimate, un-ironic laughs. Regretful, dumb and embarrassed laughs, maybe, but then I came to realize this only amplifies the show’s greatest message. Perhaps our obsession with insisting on higher-than-thou highbrow-over-lowbrow entertainment is all missing the point; why treat our silly little human senses of humour as somehow subhuman? Why downplay the easy comedic options simply because they aren't ""refined” or “sophisticated” enough? If one finds them amusing, then maybe there’s no sense feeling embarrassed, or holding it in. 
If I really must criticize anything, the only issues I can come up with are pacing problems and slow points, repetition, predictable punchlines, lazy writing, lazier presentation, overly-deadpan delivery to ever-diminishing effect, a soundtrack that's either cheesy or nonexistent, unremarkable sound design, ridiculous logic, and one-dimensional characters with instant and artificial development. 
Go watch it, seriously. Experiencing this modern classic requires mere minutes of your time!

Nanoha is a bit of a strange franchise, it took the typically girly magical girl and injected into it a dose of gundam style action and a much grittier story than common for this kind of series. The result was something of a mixed bag, the early episodes were almost indistinguishable from many other mahou shoujo's. As it went on though the story improved and it turned into something that while no masterpiece could certainly hold its own. 
So how does this movie version compare? Quite well. With a much shorter length the story has been compressed and streamlined down cutting out much of the early stuff. In fact it seems that almost entire episodes were removed and they certainly took out many of the jewel seed encounters. For the most part this is a good thing. This version of the story gets to the point much quicker and doesn't waste time on filler that did little to advance either story or character. 
Unfortunately with the filler has also gone some stuff that really should have stayed. While losing the earlier battles isn't a problem, losing nearly all of Nanoha's quieter time is. There is a significant lack of time spent on fleshing out her character, nearly all the scenes of her with friends or family have either been cut or reduced. True one could claim that as characters they were rather minor in the series itself but they helped to flesh out Nanoha, to show her as something more real. In short whereas before Nanoha was a girl who happened to be a magical girl here she is only a magical girl. In many ways she feels like she's there really just to move the story along. 
The other big change (and whether it is a problem will depend on your preferences) is the shift in focus from Nanoha to Fate. This is much more Fate's story and the emotional centre, has shifted over to her. Whereas Nanoha has suffered in the character stakes she has prospered. Fate's story remains the same as before but  there is much more focus on her as a person rather than just as the rival. We get more time with Fate and her family, more time to properly understand their feelings and the emotions behind their actions. Precia too seems to be more real in this version, her actions are still deplorable but they come across as more understandable, as with Fate we get a fuller picture of why she has turned out this way. 
Is this shift of the emotional centre a good thing or not. It really depends on which character you prefer if like me you find Fate to be more interesting then you'll probably like the change if not then you may feel that too much emphasis has been placed on her leaving Nanoha (who is meant to be the lead) to be rather less interesting in comparison. 
Another difference between with the film is that there is much more concentration on action. Though this is less a result of having more battles between Nanoha and Fate and more to do with there being less of the quieter scenes. At times it can feel a little bit like it's going for action for its own sake but most of the battles do actually serve some purpose beyond the visual exhilaration of watching these two girls fight. Each encounter brings them closer to an understanding of each other and helps move the story towards its conclusion.   
In terms of art this is unsurprisingly good with improved animation especially notable in the battles but it can also be seen elsewhere, even if it has nothing else it certainly looks good. Sound too is impressive with the old cast returning to provide some excellent performances and the sound complements the action well. The music too compliments the story and the songs being not just impressive in their own right but also helping to make the emotion behind the story resonate more.  
You can probably tell that I like this movie and while it certainly isn't the greatest out there it is very entertaining. Yes I do have some concerns, but I'm willing to forgive most of them for what it does right. It cuts out much of the standard magical girl stuff and gets to the point much quicker. It's a pity that in doing so Nanoha suffered a distinct decrease in her quality as a character and that is the only real problem that I can't easily overlook. Still on the whole even this doesn't actually ruin it just makes it less than it could have been.  
Do the things it does right make up for the loses? I would say that for the most part yes but I'd rather I didn't have to make that choice. Still you should check this one out. It not only works well as a retelling but is also a good entrance point for those new to the franchise.

This is a no-spoiler review. As a preamble, I rate anime a bit different than most people: I rate primarily on premise, characters, and enjoyment. Quality (art/sound/animation/etc.) can raise (or lower) a show if it is exceptional (or horrible), however. 
I don't think I've ever hated the fact that I've enjoyed an anime so much. Now I'll have to explain to my friends that I'm not a furry when I recommend this - I'm already a degenerate weeb! On a serious note, however, Beastars completely surprised me. I didn't expect much when I went into this, and what I got was a very interesting premise with stunning execution, dynamic and realistic character development, and a thrilling show from start to finish. This was my first anime to receive a - in over a year, and honestly, it was refreshing to watch an anime that truly felt this good after such a long time.  
Story/Premise: - 
I'll be honest - the idea of watching anthropomorphized animals was a turn-off at first. No disrespect to the furry community, but it really isn't my thing and I was honestly expecting it to just be a typical slice-of-life anime but with animals instead of humans. I couldn't have been more wrong. The fact that the characters are animals is of extreme importance to the show and it diversifies both the characters and world in immense detail. The show depicts a world where herbivores and carnivores are unified, living together in a society free of meat. However, what actually exists is a tense and delicate balance, ripe with black market shenanigans and rabid, carnivorous gangs. The plot is further complicated when the main character, a wolf, begins to feel a deeper connection towards a white dwarf rabbit. The show doesn't just use animals to make itself stand out - it does so in a way no show with human characters could. The final conclusion felt a bit lackluster and cliche compared to the rest of the show, though a -nd season is coming so this isn't a big problem. There were also some loose ends and unanswered questions, but again, I feel the -nd season will answer these. 
Characters: -- 
Beastars shined in every regard, but where it really reached masterpiece quality was its character development. The characters in this show are absolutely fantastic. Characters receive dynamic development and have personalities that feel lifelike. Ironically, while I praised the show for using animals in a way that actually makes them feel like animals, the characters shine most when expressing their humanity. Characters simultaneously express human-like traits and desires while battling their animal instincts. Is it possible for a carnivore to view a herbivore as more than potential prey? What makes the character development in this show so powerful isn't just the fact that the characters change and develop over time, but the fact that they must either accept or change the predisposition their species is associated with. 
Enjoyment: - 
Beastars manages to make almost every moment thrilling, whether it be the visualizations of tense relationships between characters or the occasional brawl. Beastars focuses on two primary elements: character interactions and society as a whole. It is the drama element of this show that makes it so entertaining. Action is an easy way to make an anime fun and boisterous, but Beastars manages to keep viewers on the tip of their toes with constant clashes between characters and a tense, suspenseful atmosphere where you can never really tell what will happen next. 
Quality: + 
The quality of Beastars is pretty impressive, especially for a CG show. The CG is done well, but it's also nothing particularly beautiful. What makes the quality stand out is the soundtrack - it's jovial when it needs to be, and it's dramatic when it needs to be. The opening is also quite good, and the show has - unique endings. Overall, Beastars scores high in the quality department. 
Overall: - 
Nothing has surprised me like Beastars did. I expected little and got a ton. I really didn't think this would end up being one of my top anime of ----, let alone of all time, but here we are. Don't let the -D animation or anthropomorphized animals scare you off. This show is a fantastic watch with a unique premise, astounding characters, and lots and lots of spicy drama. The worst enemy of a beast is often itself.

Since the episodes we are being reminded of have just aired, this recap is totally pointless.  If, by some chance you are coming to this series for the first time, please, just watch episodes ----.  You will not be able to make sense of them from this episode.  If, like --% of viewers, you have been watching from the beginning, you will gain absolutely no extra information, alternate view of the story, or even just new artwork. Even though this recap is told nominally from Sinon's point of view, it is provides no new material concerning the plot or the characters.  A total waste of time!

A modest success in it's home country that became a bigger hit once it aired on Adult Swim in ----, Watanabe's jazz-infused space western has become one of anime's most enduring classics and for good reason. To a lot of people in the early ----s, CB was their gateway anime and it's by far one of the most accessible titles due to the fact that it almost feels tailor-made for western audiences given how the show heavily draws from westerns, john woo action flicks, and film noir.  
Despite being mostly episodic in nature with the over-arching story being relatively thin (only - ep touch on the Spike vs. Vicious plot), CB manages to stay engaging throughout due to it's intoxicating atmosphere, immersive world-building, layered characters, light-hearted comedy and memorable scenarios. Plenty of my favorite anime episodes ever are in CB (Ex. Ballad of Fallen Angels, Sympathy for the Devil, Ganymede Elegy, Jupiter Jazz). CB also has one of the greatest and most satisfying endings to any show ever.  
The English dub by Animaze is also deserving of all the praise it gets as one of the greatest dubs of all time with Steve Blum, Beau Billingslea, Wendee Lee and Melissa Fahn delivering iconic performances. Not a single voice sounds out of place and the line deliveries sound so natural. Probably my personal favorite of the show's guest stars was Daran Norris as Andy von de Oniyate, who is a complete riot!  
When a dub is so good that even the most hardened sub-purists would tell you to watch the show in English first before the Japanese, then you know it's something truly special.  
While I have nothing but love for CB, there are a couple of flaws that prevent me from giving it a perfect score. Given it's episodic nature, inevitably there are going to be episodes that are better than others. Despite containing plenty of good to even great episodes, there are a couple stories that come out average (Ex. Bohemian Rhapsody) and episode -- (Boogie Woogie Feng Shui) is a straight-up stinker. It also would have been nice if the over-arching plot episodes were more evenly spread out throughout the show's run.  
There is also a part of me that wishes the show utilized Ed more often in the plots. I love Ed and her surreal comic antics never fail to put a smile on my face, but we rarely get to see her put her computer hacking skills to good use.  
One character that I felt could have used more development was Vicious. We never get much of a glimpse of what Spike and Vicious' relationship was like in the past. Vicious also does not have much of personality and thus feels more like a force of nature than a fully-fleshed out character. Maybe the whole force of nature thing was the point but nonetheless, Vicious always came off as one of the show's less interesting elements.  
Despite some of these minor issues, I still come back to CB often and watch the series at least once every year. There is a lot of re-watch value due to it's subtle deep existential themes and well-crafted stories.

“Repeating trial and error and failing many times… it’s that process which makes the dishes shine.” – Soma Yukihira 
Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Yuuki Marisaki also works as a person, providing the manga creator with the recipes. An anime adaptation by J.C. Staff aired between April - and September --, ----.  
Meet Souma, he is the son of the owner of a small eatery in Japan. For his age, Souma is a very talented person able to easily come up with new dishes; sometimes these dishes are some really weird combinations of the ingredients no one would ever use. After some time, the owner of the Souma’s eatery, Souma’s father, leaves the family business to work with his friend. Souma’s restaurant is on the verge of closing. To improve his cooking skills and to save the restaurant, Souma begins studying in Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, which is regarded as Japan’s top culinary academy. The problem is that only a few are able to graduate from it, these few are world’s best gourmet of culinary. Will Souma manage to graduate from the academy?  
Well, this is difficult one to review. Food Wars is a very unusual anime that is worth watching for many reasons. It is interesting to watch, since it does a great job with tension. The main genre of the series, as I see it, is SoL. Yet, there are so many action scenes that you cannot believe that what you are watching is not an action series. In Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, only the strong have the right to decide. So long story short, whenever you do not agree with something, you duel. No, they do not duel to death. Whenever a conflict might appear, the students have a culinary duel.  They cook some dishes and have judges assess their creation. And this is so cool. This might sound lame and boring, however, the creator of Food Wars managed to make these duels amazingly epic to watch.  
Animation wise, Food Wars has some amazing animation: from character designs, to amazing action scenes. Cooking has never been this epic. There are so many colors that you cannot close your mouth from amazement. Sound wise, Food Wars has an okay OST and some great Japanese voice acting. I highly recommend you to watch it subbed.  
The main protagonist of Food Wars is Yuukihira Souma. He is only fifteen, but he is already a highly talented individual, who just wants to take over the family’s business. To achieve that goal, he fights with the business woman in the region, where he lives, who wants to buy the restaurant. Souma’s father tells his son that only if he graduates from Totsuki can he succeed both in the business and in surpassing his old man. The problem is that only --% actually graduate the academy. Anyways, aside from Souma, there are many other interesting characters to follow. What is more, even supporting characters are quite interesting.  
Enjoyment wise, this show is so enjoyable to watch that you cannot stop watching the series; you want more and more. There is an ecchi grain in it, but it is never unnecessary; it only shows how amazing the food is the foodgasms are real. 
Overall, it is a real gem. Warning: never watch Food Wars, when you are hungry, or you might regret it. Never before have I seen something even close to Food Wars. Great job Yuuto Tsukuda.

Yami no Matsuei is a very, very cringe-worthy series that I used to be into―back when I was in middle school―and then recently decided to revisit as an adult, and, oh boy! This series is badーlike really, really bad! To start out with, the most glorified character in the series is a serial killer, pedophile, scientistーwhose entire motivation for committing all of his heinous, degenerative crimes is to get revenge on his deceased brother by… making him immortal, so he can kill him for all of eternity? The series mentions briefly that Muraki’s parents were killed and his brother was some type of evil, Luciferian sociopath, but what kind of insane devotion is that? Especially when Muraki is a psychopathic killer himself! The irony! 
•	Another strange thing about the murderous diddler (Muraki) is that the series practically ships him with the main character (Tsuzuki) who is immortal, but happened to die and become a spirit-realm detective, for some reason? And while Muraki is set on using Tsuzuki’s decapitated body as his brother’s vessel, it is implied that he actually loves him, or something? Everything in this series is cryptic, not explained, and doesn’t make a bit of sense; the first episode expects you to know that the main cast work for a spirit judiciary, police force without telling you… it only mentions that there’s a spirit councilーin a short narration before the opening theme. 
•	Another weird connection between the central cast of characters is that the main character’s partner (Hisoka) was tortured, raped, and murdered by Muraki, but this is rarely mentioned―outside of the main arc, despite Muraki being the glorified Joker-type character and practically what the entire series revolves around! The most that happens is that he scowls whenever Muraki comes around, because, you know, it’s not like you would want to murder or attack the person that LITERALLY raped you to death or anything! I hate to mention this, but shounen-ai and yaoi series are really bad at emphasizing the seriousness of sexual assault, in fact, it seems like a weird kink in most cases. I played the DRAMAtical Murder visual novel and the plot fetishized Mink spiking Aoba’s drink and date-raping him… and in both the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi Movie: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai AND the first episode of Dakaretai Otoko --i ni Odosarete Imasuーthe protagonist gets drunk, ends up naked in bed with a guy he just met (who’s supposed to be the love interest), and subsequently gets blackmailed into dating him! BL series’ have a strange standard of what’s socially acceptable in a romantic relationship… 
•	There are a few other characters that get little to no screen time and don’t have a purpose to be in the series other than being the passed over, potential love interests that only exist for doujinshi fodder. There’s an accountant that acts as Tsuzuki’s secretary, a scientist that makes useless inventions, a duck mascot character that’s just there for exposition, a female character that it only shows once (whose only purpose is to buy Tsuzuki donuts), an old department manager, Muraki’s kimono-clad friend (it never really explains their relationship or how they met), and an invisible Phantom of the Opera copy-paste who has a zombie butler and no real purpose, other then to perversely fawn over Tsuzuki. 
•	The abysmal storyline is one thing, but the animation is another. For the most part, I think the character designs look really clean, especially for a series made at the beginning of the --st century; especially with the prevalence of low-quality OVAs during the period that this series airedーsomething that people knew anime for, at the time, since it was something that you could rent from Blockbuster Video and have a short love/hate affair with for the duration of --- episodes. When things like Urotsukidōji permeated through the culture and diluted the public’s consensus towards anime. With that being said, the animation in Descendants of Darkness is appalling! Characters slide across the screen, teleport, and if a character caresses another’s face or wipes away a tear―it looks like a person is dragging a cursor across a screen! Terrifyingly bad! I would prefer ugly character designs to animation that’s THIS freaking bad! 
•	The scripting is poor, nonsensical, and even laughableーat times. The characters are the worst exaggerations of yaoi stereotypes that you can possibly imagine. The animation is some of the worst I’ve ever seen. The only credit that I can give this show is that the character designs and imagery aren’t the worst. Overall, I give this convoluted mess a -/--.

I watched it to the point where it runs out of manga material and I dropped it. 
The anime can be split in two parts: 
Epides from - to about -- - this part is amazing. There are interesting and relatable character, tesne fights, good storytelling and great music. WIt is at least -/-- or -/-- material. 
Episodes -----. - this is where it gets bad. Suddenly we have long string of fights, and usually a single fight takes - episodes, plus the singer in the intro starts singing off-key. Drawn out, slow, with pacing problems, and all the hallmarks of bad shounen anime - people talking for -- minutes mid fight, discussing each other's techniques and how exceptional those techniques are. This part is very very bad, something around -/-- or even -/--. I didn't like it, although this arc has its fans. 
And past episode --... I heard it only gets worse and mostly contains filler. -- episodes of it. 
I don't know, maybe one day I'll finish it (probably not), but as far as I can tell, it is only worth watching to around episode --, if you want quality materail, and anything past episode -- to -- is for mostly shounen fans. 
Some details are below. For the purposes of review I'll call ---- as ""part -"" and ""-----"" as part -. 
Story: 
Very interesting in part -, and very tedious in part -. 
Art: 
Decent, but it is low detailed and fairly low-budget, because it was a tv show. 
Sound: 
Good in the first part (the intro song is nice), and gets slightly worse in the second part, where singer in the intro starts singing off-key. 
Characters: 
They sorta progress/change over time, but some of them can be extremely annoying. Yahiko is incredibly annoying, and if in the first part it is sorta tolerable, in the second part I was seriously wondering why he isn't dead. Kaoru can be annoyingly needy and manipulative too. Overall, however, it is less about characters and more about the overall story, which is focused on kenshin. 
Enjoyment: 
Liked first part, hated second part, dropped -rd part. 
Overall: 
First -- something episodes are worth watching, past that point it is worth watching only if you really like shounen anime. Haven't seen it past episode --, but a lot of people seem to be saying it only gets worse past that point.

...And all of a sudden errryone had superpowers. Tokyo ESP is an anime in which many people get superpowers because they are on drugs. I say this because a select few persons can see fishes swimming around in air (obviously they are under influence of drugs). The first thing I would think if I saw a flying penguin or fluorescent fishes in the air is ask myself if I am sane. Not these characters, they just believe and inmediately accept what they see. Anyway, jokes aside, these fishes seem to give people superpowers by going in a person. All you have to do is wish for it (that's the impression I got, at least) and you get it. 
There is no real explanation as to how the superpowers work; in the first episode I even thought the superpowers were due to the accesories the villains were wearing. However, this disappears later on, so it might be the authors thought the same thing and wanted to make clear that the superpowers were the real deal. There also seems to be a very limited amount of superpowers. I think it does not make any sense for people to have the same skill, but this is, again, not explained.  
Another issue is the powerups. It looks like less than a week of training makes you a pro fighter; if you are a genius, you can certainly make faster progress, but not this fast. Besides, all the people are not so bright, most people have mental disorders and some people just know everything; no explanation as to why they know. Are they psychics or something? This obviously makes no sense.  
All right, I will just say it: this story does not make any sense. As the story progresses, events seem to have less connection to each other, which results in a bland story. One example is that the connection with the first episode is not well made, since statements that were done in the -st episode are overwritten and forgotten. Finally, the last episode is an incredible ass-pull: everything ""ends"" in one single chapter, making everything that happened in this episode plain dumb. 
Tokyo ESP has a cast of characters made in such a way that they made me laugh when I first saw them. We have Wolverine as ""Muscle Dad"", Aristotle as ""That yakuza guy"", the male main character (whom I liked most) as ""The youngster that has seen too much JoJo"" and the female MC as ""She who became super strong all of a sudden but is useless anyway"". Of course there are other characters; one of them is a villain who all of a sudden decided to become friends with the MC just to help fight against ""true"" evil. There is that girl with glasses that appears in EVERY anime who is quite useless and a boy with glasses who looks like an idiot. I will also write a line about mascots. There were three exotic mascots in this anime. One. every. -. episodes. Personally, I don't think mascots make something more popular (I found them annoying), but it looks like the authors thought it was the key to success. 
The characters have vague pasts at best (even for the male MC), and the reason why they do what they do is not clear either. I guess the authors did not want to think too much about it, since all explanations have holes in them. I think that in the end the villains were the righteous ones. Personally, I won't trust a government that hires Jason (you know, that madman with the mask & bat) as policeman.  
The soundtrack is quite good, but I have the impression that battle music is used in the wrong moments. And there is a serious issue with the first episode; the music is so ridiculously loud you can't hear the characters talking, which I found quite annoying. Or maybe I just downloaded the episode from the wrong place. 
The art is allright, not really special. Almost all the side characters are incredibly ugly, which is quite funny. I guess all attention has to go to the main and secondary characters. But the mouths... my god. The shading on them is just weird, it feels like the characters are continually using ""smug face"". 
So, Tokyo ESP is not something really good, but if you have some time to fill you might want to give it a shot. Just don't expect much of it. My rating is a -. 
Oh right, this is my first review, so please tell me what you thought about it.

With the whole MALpocalypse going on, I went on my profile to find out what was on there in the first place. Apparently, about - years ago, I wrote a review on this anime but it got deleted somewhere along the way. At first, I couldn't for the life of me remember what this anime was about, but when I watched the trailer I remembered IMMEDIATELY. 
This anime was pure trash, but there's a twist so hear me out. The story makes no sense whatsoever. The man who wrote this show and got a producer to actually make it is a literal genius. Thinking about how in the world he convinced anyone to put money into this blows my mind. Why nobody stopped this show from being green-lit is beyond me. It kind of tries to tell the story of overthrowing a shogunate, but instead it's rock music overthrowing pop music?? I guess???  
The songs aren't even catchy though, I'd never want to listen to any of these songs more than once. The only thing that wasn't outright bad about this show was, in my opinion, the character design. The protagonist, Ryouma, has red hair that's cellshaded with a green/blue-ish color which I think is a really interesting palette to use in an anime. Normally you'd expect that in concept art but not in the actual anime. 
That being said, this anime is the PERFECT guilty pleasure. 
Some people busy themselves with determining what a ""good"" anime is, defending their personal favorites against others' critiques and artfully riposting with criticisms of their own. I can get swept away in that sometimes, but it is shows like these that remind me why I watch anime in the first place: it's FUN! It doesn't have to make sense, the songs don't have to be catchy, there doesn't have to be character development or good storytelling!  
I have to admit, I watched the anime weekly as it aired so I didn't have to sit through hours of cringe in one sitting. But at the time, it did exactly what all anime do for me; it provided escape. It doesn't matter how crappy it is, if it kills time then why the heck not! I don't always want to have to break my brains over deep, complicated, psychological anime. Sometimes I just want to be whisked away and get a few good laughs in. That is exactly what Bakumatsu Rock will do for you. No more, no less.

I really like animes based on games. Some of my fav. were SAO, Overlord, Log Horizon, AccelWorld and No Game No Life. At first I was really into this one too, I watched like - episodes in a row. But the thing that bothered me kept getting worse. It was the lack of logic. Just stop trying to make sense of everything and you may like this anime. 
I like animes where I can identify with the characters myself. I love it when I can predict the reactions of the main characters or at least make sense of it. It really frustates me when this IDIOTIC main character does this random ass things. I mean like, come on, even after being the freaking BEST player in Japan, why the hell does he rely on luck so much. Also there's just too much unnecessary drama. I never understand the logic behind explaining the plan to your enemy. Like seriously, why??

Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless. 
You see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presented in a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, -----%. Well... maybe... erm... 
Anyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply ""moe"". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called ""Jiggly Jiggly Heaven"" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour. 
The reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions:  
Would you work under him?  
Now think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead. 
What would you do when you found out he's this way? 
Would you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would? 
Except that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: ""Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy."" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay. 
And this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a ""oh my god a setback"" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out. 
It looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through. 
That was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic.  
The art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: ""DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!"". Ugh. 
As you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them. 
If you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.

Japanese Jingoism!  Which is sad for many reasons, not the least of being that I am down for almost every part of this anime except for it's ultimate flaw: jingoism.   
Journalism equals blind pessimism?  The UN doesn't value sovereignty?  And SPOILER: American spec ops are no match for Japanese?  These are not only all proven false by history and current events, but I don't think I'd like the writers of this story if I met them.  Even if we were all smoking together, I still think they'd remind me of the Japanese version of a FOX NEWS watcher.   
Gate could be awesome, and is --% well made.  The characters are cool and unique.  There are not only strong female characters, but there is also a lack of the male gaze which permeates most media (not to our fault most of the time) and is extremely prevalent in Japanese culture.   
All the Jingoism, though.

What a crap, the story consist of plot-holes, and plot twists, almost every episode someone changes side, or revealed that they were on the other side all along or some other terrible secret, then everyone acts the same as ever in the next episode. There is one guy who helps the enemy, but the main cast lets him escape, then next time he spies on them but, the 'smart glasses guy' says it's not a problem, then a the next episode, said guy brings the bad guys on them, resulting in others dying, then a few episides later said guy heps the main cast. 
While the starting point and the end point of the story is clear, the inbetween is murky at best. Enemies survive clearly fatal hits for the sake of plot, the main group has the ability to teleport,  only shown travelling when there is some interaction during, otherwise they can travel as much as half a continent from one scene to the next. 
Generally it feels like some episodes had material for --- other episodes, while there are some episodes that are just a waste of time, thus the pacing is all over the place. 
The art and sound are good, but these are about the only things the show got right, though there are some inconsistencies like size differences and ""interesting"" design choices, but I suspect the had to follow already existing designes. The voice acting is mostly good, the annoying character has annoying VA, which I wouldn't really put as a negative. 
The characters are bad, lots of side characters get introduced who barely show up later and don't really serve any purpose. The main cast seems forced, most of the things they do are for advancing the plot even at the cost of not staying in character. As already mentioned everyone has some dark secret, which doesn't really seem to impact relations, as already mentioned. 
It's not enjoyable at all, I've only finished it to see where it would end up, but should have dropped - episodes in. The combat is boring, mostly consisting of talking while hacking at each others sword, then when it's time to finish them someone from the main cast defeats/kills the opponent in one hit, there is no casting time or the like, so they could have done so from the start which ruins any suspension. Wounds, even lethal ones, don't seem to matter, only if the plot requires the character's death. 
Overall it's really bad, you are better off reading the plot somewhere. While it does have interesting concepts it fails to integrate them into the story, there really isn't anything special, except the unusually high number of turncoats, it's generic magic/fantasy hero saves the world, and bad at that.

As an avid reader of SAO novels, I can hardly find the right words to describe my disappointment for this season. 
In mandarin we have a saying for anime call 窮得只剩錢, which could translate to all you have is money. This is exactly what I saw this season.  
The visuals and the animation in the OP showed us what the production group have and could achieve. Alicization's art style and details is definitely something that is worth applauding for. It had been the best in the series and one of the best this season. 
But the story and character development are jokes. Whoever pacing the story must have not read the novel before, cutting things out and expecting viewers to understand. If you are not telling much about the big ass spider in the first place, why bother introduce it later? The anime also turned Eugeo from a likable character into a teenager with boner power.

Not being a native English speaker, I usually don't write reviews on MAL. But ""Jingai-san no Yome"", come on, how can such a show reach a score of -.--? There is nothing in it. It's not funny, not cute, not touching, not even eye pleasing, nothing. It's so bad it doesn't even deserve an ironic review which would only lure people into thinking ""it's so bad it's good"", but it's not the case. 
So what do we got here? We are in a world where young males are chosen at school by weird creatures to become their wives. The young males have no prior knowledge of the creatures, have never spoken with them, and yet they all seem very pleased and instantly fall in love. The creatures range from small piggy like things to huge bear like creatures, not to forget female one winged cyclops twins. To make things better, half of those creatures do not speak. How do they reproduce? No idea, and the show won't give a clue (fortunately!). 
One day, the main protagonist, whose name I already forgot, is chosen as a mate by (Ba)Kanenogi-san. A speechless -.- meters high creature, stupid enough to continuously bump his head on the wall above the door until the MC tells him to bend down... But everything is well, because Bakanenogi-san's fur is so fluffy... Oh yeah, Bakanenogi-san eats bricks too, something that I guess was supposed to be funny. Ahem. 
Everything in this show is bad. The art is subpar, as is the animation. As for the sound, yep, pretty bad as well. I could do with all this if at least it was funny, but alas, the humor is nonexistent. This is really appalling. Yes, I get it's a - minutes show, but some - minutes animes achieve much more than this. I really enjoyed ""Aiura"" (- minutes) a few years ago. Yesterday I laughed a lot wathcing ""Orenchi no Furo Jijou"" (- minutes), and ""Teekyuu"" with its frantic pace manages to be funny in - minutes. ""Jingai-san no Yome"" just sucks. 
Seriously, even the infamous ""Mars of Destruction"" is a hundred times better than this piece of crap, and that is saying! Yes, it is that bad.

This is a very unique show , not only in presentation but also in its content. 
It has a very expressionistic art style, slow pacing and a heavy emphasis on characters and their dialogue. 
It deals with themes such as the effect of technology on our lives and our relationships. 
The show uses heavy moments very sparingly in order to increase the weight of them more , and it succeeds, 
It also can get caught up in its artsyness and suffer from lack of production value occasionally. 
The more important shots are visually appealing and detailed though. 
This show is definitely not for everyone. 
Patience is a prerequisite and this show is for thinking and not really for entertainment. 
Lovers of character pieces, satire on modern life and technology and its effects on an ever growing society will probably like this. 
People whose favorite anime is Gurren Lagann will probably be bored to tears. 
The show can be a real mindfuck and its often hard to see where it’s all going , but I was nonetheless interested in what it had to offer. 
In the end the show has interesting ideas , but the way it is executed slightly disappoints. 
The show is not bad by any means , but a bit more coherence would’ve created the drive for the viewer to analyze the story, characters and themes more like what happened in evangelion. 
I believe shows that want to express ideas and want to be artsy need to have a solid framework to build upon. 
Lain lacks in exactly that aspect.

Review after seven episodes. 
So, initially, I really liked the premise of this show, and I was hoping I would like the show, itself, more than I have so far. I'll keep watching to see if it gets better, but here are my thoughts as of right now. 
The sound design for this anime is fantastic, and by far the best part about it. I've never described sounds as ""lush"" before, but I can't think of any other way to say it. Every single sound effect is a treat for the ears, and this show definitely deserves an award for the work they did here. 
That said, there are big problems with this show. The plot is basically a monster-of-the-week style show that misses the point of those shows. For that formula to work, the main character typically first encounters people affected by a monster, then decides he needs to stop the monster, then he stops the monster so the people can get back to their lives. In this show, there's no real way for people affected by a monster to communicate that fact to the protagonist, so there's very little at stake for him emotionally in the battle. From the protagonist's point of view, the story is about a guy who wanders around in random directions until he encounters a monster, then he fights the monster because he has nothing better to do. 
Now, to be fair, there are some times when the monsters, themselves, make for interesting characters, but this is more exception than the rule.  Most of the time, the monster is just a mindless, snarling beast that moves through the world as aimlessly as the protagonist. 
Character-wise, they took a big risk making the main character unable to communicate or receive communication, and it unfortunately doesn't pay off. As near as I can tell, he has no motivations at all. He just kills monsters because that's his intrinsic nature. On top of that, none of the recurring characters have anything I can latch on to in order to sympathize with them. The titular Dororo is shown from his introduction to be a certified scumbag who repays kindness with cruelty. When he meets the main character, he immediately tries to exploit him. We don't know enough about his backstory to know why he is like this. We know he's poor and a child, which I guess is supposed to make him sympathetic, but those are stats, not personality traits. We also know he has a ""good soul"". Not because of anything he says or does, mind you, but because the anime literally tells us so. Seven episodes in, and he's not built any kind of relationship with the protagonist, mostly because he can't. The protagonist, himself, is less of a character than a McGuffin, and the story treats him like he's a Fighting Log. He did eventually develop the ability to speak, but until he develops the inclination to speak, we've no idea what, if anything, is going through his head. We've also got a blind, elderly cryptic monk, who is the resident exposition potato. The demons, themselves, are also usually lacking in motivation beyond ""be hostile"". 
Now, I recently found out that this show is a -- episode title, which is good, as it gives it a little more time to hopefully develop its characters.  For the first four episodes, they've basically been just running through a checklist of their twelve demons, killing about one an episode, so hopefully they'll be able to use the second half of the series to focus on a more dramatic conflict between the protagonist and his father.  Although the two of them are just barely aware of each other right now, they're beginning to feel the effects of each other's actions, so I'm hopeful that the plot will get better, but that's little more than speculation at this point.  
In order to reinforce what could have been an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, they probably should have made the Fighting Log a little less capable so that he was forced to depend on the titular side-character for food or shelter, or other basic necessities that don't involve fighting monsters, but they didn't. That would have made both characters more sympathetic. I'll keep watching for a little while, and my opinion might change, but right now, this is where I am.

Blast of Tempest / Zetsuen no Tempest 
Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans 
Blast of Tempest has good ideas and decent writing, but lost my interest with the incredibly slow story progression and drawn out dialogue. Explanations of explanations and single scenes that lasted longer than an episode were a common occurrence. 
You might enjoy this if: You have patience and like to have everything explained in great detail. 
You might not like it if: You want a story to progress at a decent pace. 
Note to the Viewer: Blast of Tempest feels like you are watching a book. It explains everything as if you are just listening to it, not watching. 
EXPANDED REVIEW FROM SLC ANIME: 
There were mixed reviews about the battles, some people saying there was too much conversation followed by too short of a battle. Others thought the importance of the battle was in the conversation, a “Logic Battle”, so to speak. Speaking of conversation, a common comment was regarding how slow the story progressed, a prime example being the scene of the princess trying to get transported off the island…A scene that lasted about five episodes! The series could have been tighter with less explanation. There was super explanation for every possible circumstance, which resulted in poor pacing. On top of that, there were slow pans throughout these extended scenes to make it seem like something was happening, where there was nothing but drawn out explanations. There were mixed reviews regarding the characters. Some people enjoyed the characters while others did not connect with the characters, believing many were pointless or became pointless halfway through the series. 
There was a fresh take on magic in the series, with people having to use talismans to create magic, and the talismans could be used by pretty much anyone with the proper knowledge. The animation was another positive aspect of the series. The last positive comment that was mentioned by several group members was regarding how the series drew on Shakespeare in many ways. For example, throughout the series there are several mentions comparing Hamlet and The Tempest. In other words, if you are familiar with Shakespeare, there are several parts that may interest you.

What exactly was I watching? From the looks of it, Master of Martial Hearts was trying to be some sort of Ikki Tousen knockoff where Aya is caught up in a clothes-tearing and fan service loaded tournament against a number of fetish-themed women competing for a prize that will grant one's wish. However beyond the clothes tearing, panty shots and boob exposure, the plot to this series is quite a mess. There are enough lapses in logic for the setup of the tournament where it's claimed to be a secret tournament which is quite ridiculous as there are several occasions in the series where Aya's fights with the fetish-themed women are out in the open with a good-sized crowd of witnesses. Much of the plot is pretty much padding for the ecchi content from the fights and the occasional hints being dropped about the true nature of the Platonic Heart tournament. You don't get to know very much about the women that Aya faces as their roles are limited to titillating its audience and being punching bags for Aya who is conveniently skilled in fighting. The final episode seemingly tries to rip a page from School Day's book by having a shocking and unexpected resolution concerning the reality of the Platonic Heart tournament. But whereas the finale to School Days at least worked because of how much the series had viewers hate the show's cast throughout its run (one of the few times you'll see me compliment School Days on something), the resolution to Master of Martial Hearts was quite nonsensical and mean-spirited with what is revealed and the challenges Aya had to put up with. 
In terms of presentation, Master of Martial Hearts is below par in visual quality for an OAV series as it looked to be on par with a TV anime. Scenery and character designs are on the plain side in terms of quality, though battle scenes are not well animated with a number of apparent shortcuts and a decent number of occasions where the bust sizes of female characters are inconsistent. The soundtrack to the series is nothing special, though the OP song to the series tends to be a bit on the obnoxious side. 
Master of Martial Hearts isn't a series I can find myself recommending to anybody unless you are part of the title's intended audience. Being unoriginal, its plot being a convenient excuse for its ecchi material, having subpar animation for an OAV title and a questionable way in which it resolves its plot, it's no wonder there are many folks who find this to be one of anime's most recent duds.

Spoiler free review. Are we wolves? or are we human? ~ Ame 
Story: -/--  
It's about a woman who has - children from a wolfman and it's showing her daily life and the children's daily life as half wolf, half human. 
it looked more like a Disney film then an anime. 
Art: -/-- 
I don't know why MAL rates - as decent but okay :). 
Nothing outstanding, I found the animation a bit annoying because of the eyes being too far away from each other. it's bad for a ---- anime. 
Sound: -/-- 
It was good, the voice actors did a great job, the soundtracks were nice and beautiful.  
Character: -/-- 
I like the characters, they all have nice and likeable characters especially the character development for Ame. 
Enjoyment: -/--  
It was boring until the last --/--/-- minutes. I expected more of one of the best rated movies that's not a spin-off or so.  
Overall: -/-- 
Well the movie was a bit too long in my opinion, I didn't felt anything outstanding of it. It had some great drama moments. (You'll maybe cry I didn't but I understand if you do). Recommended for slice of life fans.

This is the first time I am writing a review and don't expect a complete analysis. I felt the need to say something in favor of this anime, since a lot of reviews are quite negative. 
Violet Evergarden starts off kinda blunt, kinda boring. She is this emotionless person and I understand why people gave this anime a bad score after watching the first few episodes. 
But believe me: it gets better. I have just finished watching the --th episode and this is one of the very few animes that can make me cry. So far it's a great anime and her character development is amazing, just keep on watching.

This one I just finished moments ago and it is a complete --. Keep in mind that I watch and finish about one anime a day and I don't give out a full score very often but this one got it. It made me reminisce about watching Clannad and Chobits, combining a fine mix of romance and the adversities of just being as normal as anyone else. Although these characters are still in high school, they still overcome some adversaries that most won't have to by going to a normal school because they go to a school for the arts. Choosing your path in life and having to come to the realization that there are others better than you is something most people have to do in their life and this anime conveys the frustration that one feels when they have to go through such a thing. Also throw in the feelings of love between people that may or may not reciprocate just makes the show that much more wrenching to watch as each character tries to find their own way. In the end, trust me, and give it a watch.

This is my first review and I am doing it in order to improve how I judge the anime I watch. Thus, I am sticking to the story/art/sound/character/enjoyment rating, because I think it is a good way to categorize rating. 
Story - -/-- 
First thing, the story has a great apresentation because it is not presented to the viewers from the start. During the movie, you start to understand what is going on. This is so well done that the story progresses without become complicated, to the point that, by half of the movie, you can completely understant it. This presentation makes you curious about what the plot is and unable to leave the screen. 
The themes adressed  by the movie are very diverse, some are very common and others, not that much. The supperficial theme of the main characters is the common trust and friendship theme, but analysing deeper the story, you get to see more profound themes like, ambition and redemption. 
Also, one more thing I would like to say, that made me love the story, is that every screentime given to a characters is important, that being for his development or for the justification of how he will act in future events. 
Art - --/-- 
The animation was one of te things that led me to watch this movie and I can say I am not one bit disapointed. The animation is perfect. It is very detailed and very fluid, something very evident during the epic fight scenes. 
The art is simple yet beautiful. The design of the characters and the ambient, which are very detailed, accomplish the mission of setting you in the Segonku period. 
Sound - --/-- 
I am not an specialist in dubbing, but it sounded perfect to me. Also the dubbers' voice, in my opinion, matched perfectly with their characters. 
Now about the soundtrack, boy, what a soundtrack. It not only set the tone, together with the animation and art, making you feel like you are in the medieval Japan, but it also set the tone for the various moments of the movie, they being moments of epicness or moments of sentiment. 
Characters - --/-- 
As the story, in the beggining you do not know much about the characters, what gives space to some character developing, and how it is well done. All the main characters, and some of the secundary ones,  are presented either with a great and sentimental background or with their own ambitions and objectives, which were so well told that made me care about those characters. Also, with that development, all their actions and their behaviours become very understandable.  
One more thing, during the movie, the relation of the two(or should I say three) main characters is so naturally developed and so enjoyable that i could not help it, but to cheer for the victory. 
Enjoyment - --/-- 
The combination of an animation and art beatiful for the eyes and relations between characters that progress so naturally makes watching the movie a very good experience, but the main reason of its enjoyability are the fight scenes. Those happens in various points of the movie and act to keep you thrilled until the end of the movie, which happens with one of the more gorgeous and epic fight scenes ever.  
The fight scenes in the movie are epic , very fluid, very detailed and well choreographed. Like that, any one of them, from the first to the last, pushes you to the edge of excitment. 
Overall - --/-- 
The combination of the various good aspects of the movies makes it really easy to watch it. Not just that. It actually makes it a truly fantastic experience. That being, in my opinion, this is definitely a must-see.

Cross Game is absolutely one of the best anime shows (not just sports anime) that I've seen. Period. It is another masterpiece written by Mitsuru Adachi (of Touch and H- fame). From the first episode (which is absolutely heartbreaking and a must-watch), the show just captures the viewers attention and never lets go. The best part is that Cross Game is that it is about more than just baseball. It is a story about dealing with the death of a loved one (it has a very similar feeling to AnoHana), friendship, and how two people grow and nurture each other through hardships and successes. It is honestly more like a wonderful SOL/romance/comedy that has an emphasis on baseball too. 
The story may be a little bit predictable at times, but Cross Game is more about the total journey. Don't be intimidated by the length. Time flies and there really are no filler episodes (except for one recap episode) and by the end, I was wishing that the show would never end. The characters are truly what make this show exceptional and Aoba is one of my favorite female protagonists of all time. She is way more than just a tsundere and has so much depth to her character. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. It'll have you on the edge of seat the whole time.

i didnt really like the first season, mainly because i'm not used to the comedy/slice of life genre. i decided to try to get used to these genres by continuing on and watching the second season. the character art is amazing and i just wanted to see more of the characters in this anime. 
again, there isn't really much story. i feel kind of delighted that chino's friends are shown more in this season. the op no poi is really good. the ed is also good. the other ops and eds were a meh, but still enjoyable to watch. i've yet to skip ops and eds.  
i'd just like to point out that imo, megu's voice actress seems to be a bit off compared to what she looks like. but you know, this happens in real life too, where people may sound completely different to what they look like. i didnt really put this account into my rating but it kinda did bug me a bit. 
overall, it's just cuteness overload and i really enjoyed it. i tried my best to just let everything happen and absorb the slice of life genre. some eps were funny, sad or just want to make you smile through the whole episode. i do think when i have more time, i may re-watch and re-live these moments. i'll miss chino-chan. i want to see more of chino :(.

SPOILER FREE 
IF POSSIBLE READ FULL YOU WILL KNOW A WAY TO WATCH THIS SHOW WITHOUT SPOILER 
Shippuden has a GREAT story, but show is garbage because of it's annoying fillers. When the story is really is pacing they meddle with a unrelated episode. So annoying that at some point you will definitely will feel to drop the show. That's why show is hanging in - pointer score. 
BUT if you insist only to root for story and for some characters you will love the show. 
Story is really twisted, vast and connecting but pacing is slow. They really have great fights really. 
Some characters are so great that make a great impression. 
Some character will make you puke. 
IT'S a anime worth giving a shot. I only gave this anime rating based on story. 
I know a website where a fan removed spoiler and made entire Naruto series (Naruto + Naruto Shippuden) made it watchable 
Here is the link :-  https://kissanime.ru/Anime/Naruto-Kai    episode is about a hour or - hour. You can enjoy without spoiler. 
Last thought: Everybody can enjoy this story. 
If you enjoy this then don't try to watch ""Boruto"" you will get hell of dead boring and annoying anime, so save our time.

I've talked about the PreCure franchise quite a bit. Including Futari wa, Max  Heart, & the first Max Heart film. Thus far, the weakest thing I've seen for the franchise was the mediocre Max Heart. The first film based off of that series managed to avoid a lot of its problems and turned out pretty well. Hopefully, the same will hold true for this week's fare. Futari wa PreCure: Max Heart Movie -- Yukizora no Tomodachi.  
Story: 
We open with an old man carrying an egg and flying across the sky on the back of a flying squirrel, Muta. Muta warns the old man, Roshi, not to drop the egg. Roshi says he won't but does and that's why his grand kids never call or visit. Two ice looking guys sense the situation and move to get to the egg. We cut to the one girl... You know, the boring one who was introduced in Max Heart that I can never remember the name of... I want to say Kanade. She's working with Akane when she finds the fluffy  little bird that hatched from the egg. From there we get to see our heroines, Honoka & Nagisa, as they're enjoying a ski trip. But what is this mysterious creature and why are Freezen & Frozen after it?  
Let's start with the issues with the film. The biggest one is just that it drags quite a bit. Take the ending. We get our climactic fight and then a good ten minutes of an attempted, but not well executed, secondary climax. We also have some completely pointless scenes of Honoka's grandmother. I liked her grandmother in the series but there's no reason for her to be in this film beyond an early phone call where she gives Honoka some advice. Nothing else she does has any impact on anything. The scenes that surround Ellen in general are just a drag. They revolve around her “bonding” with our mysterious friend but its very clumsily done since most of it is her holding the thing while looking dull or watching it also while looking dull. There's also a part of the film that revolves around Nagisa & Honoka having a fight but the impetus behind it is really weak. Basically, Nagisa overhears some random people who have mistaken Honoka & Fujipi for a couple and she gets upset because that's her Honoka, dammit. Here's the thing, though, Nagisa has known since before Max Heart even started that Honoka & Fujipi are old friends and she also knows that there's nothing more to their relationship than that. There's absolutely no reason for her to be upset here.  
There are also parts to the film I like. In  concept, I like the idea of contrasting a pair of true friends who will overcome their difficulties with a pair who will only stay close when things are going their way and I do like a lot of the scenes surrounding that, even if the event that kicks off that plot point is weak. A lot of the Honoka and Nagisa scenes in general are just good. I particularly like the moment where they talk about their hearts burning for one another.  
Characters: 
The characters are much the same as they are in the series proper. Nagisa and Honoka are still great characters. Ako is still entirely bland. It's nice to see Shiho and Rina get some nice support scenes. The villains are nothing ground breaking but they're fine. The same can be said for Muta, Roshi & our little bird. They're not interesting characters but they work for what the film needs them to do. Pollun is, unfortunately, back to being a major annoyance. He does throw a loud, obnoxious tantrum in this one. Honoka and Nagisa need to start packing heavy duty duct tape.  
Art: 
The artwork is nicely done. The action sequences flow well and the backgrounds are well detailed. I particularly like the way the film captures both a very picturesque winter wonderland aesthetic and a very oppressive frozen wasteland at different parts. The magical kingdom isn't nearly as pretty as the Garden of Hope was in the first Max Heart film but it's decent enough.  
Sound: 
I'll quickly go through the major characters, since I've talked about their performances at least twice previously. Honna Youko & Yukana are great. Tanaka Rie is a great actress but her performance in this is flat because Miyuki is a bore. Ikezawa Haruna's performance is annoying because that's the aesthetic they decided to go with for her character. Moving on to the film exclusive characters, Nozawa Masako returns. In the last film she was Round & Honoka's grandmother. In this one she's Muta & Honoka's grandmother. Her performance is good. You can't even tell by ear that Muta and the grandmother have the same voice. Aono Takeshi voices Roshi and he does a fine job. Our villains are voiced by Kusao Takeshi & Hiyama Nobuyuki. Both of whom deliver nice performances. Hinata is voiced by Chijimatsu Sachiko and she's decent enough. Like with the last film, Futari wa and the main series, we have a Sato Naoki soundtrack which includes Max Heart's theme tune. Which is basically Futari Wa's theme tune with minor changes. Still, he  is a good composer and it shows here.  
Ho-yay: 
Honoka and Nagisa definitely have some. And it culminates in the “burning hearts” scene. Because this is PreCure and shoujo ai subtext is what they do. Actually, is it even subtext at this point? They've held hands while cuddling up in bed and talking about how close they are and now we get the hearts burning for each other. It might qualify as just text at this point.  
Final Thoughts: 
This is actually what I expected from a Max Heart film when I reviewed the first one. It has some strong moments, some weak ones and just averages out to be kind of mediocre. If you enjoyed Max Heart or if you were a fan of Futari wa who doesn't mind putting up with Yayoi and Pollun for some cute Nagisa & Honoka moments you might enjoy watching it. For myself, I give it a -/--. Next week I'll look at Chocolate Underground.

I watched this anime because of all the references and suggestions from other people and i have to say that I did not expect to like this as much as I did. For an anime that came out in ----, the animations is nice and fluid. Fight scenes and art-styles are well animated and this is what really attracted me to the anime. The story is a bit hard to follow but a few watch throughs and you can catch up on the plot. This anime portrays a nice coming of age story while also providing comedic relief. The way the anime just tells this underlying plot while still having a bigger story that we as watchers do not know because of the length of the anime is what amazes me. This anime is only - episodes and yet tells a story so deep and connecting that I have conflicting feelings whether I want another season or not. If you have heard of this anime, I strongly suggest watching it or rewatching it just to appreciate what it is: a truly superb anime.

Recaps are usually episodes/movies that re-tell a story that has already been told, but in a shorter and more compact way. It tells you valid points and informative parts in a story without all the unnecessary bits.  
Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie -: Eien no Monogatari is a recap of the last four episodes in the original series; Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica but squeezed into a - hour long action-packed thrilling movie. When I first finished the original series of Madoka Magica I felt like I didn't watch it to my full potential (being distracted or not focusing at some points of the show.) That being, I decided to watch the recap movies, and I have no regret in doing so! 
If I didn't watch these movies, I believe my liking towards the Madoka Franchise/Series wouldn't be where it is right now. Having finished these two movies, this whole series has become one of my favorite anime! 
If you aren't too sure whether you should attempt to watch the movies, I recommend watching this no doubt! And with no hesitation! Here is my review for Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Movie -: Eien no Monogatari! Enjoy! 
STORY - --/-- 
This movie mainly revolves around Homura and Madoka because it is a recap of the last - episodes from the original series, which involves the back story to Homura ""Magical Girl"" journey. A plot that gets twisted a lot makes this movie very psychological and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It plays with the 'Magical Girl' genre a bit and creates something beyond what a normal series of this genre would do. This is simply genius in my opinion! 
The story telling in this anime is just too beautiful to explain! The originality and creativity that goes into this is what makes this anime for me. A simple plot, with a bunch of twists and turns throughout keeps you intrigued almost through the whole thing. 
Even though this movie is a recap of the original series (last - episodes) it still has extra scenes thrown in to it, with better animation and re-dub of the voices. The story is really intense and confusing at sometimes, so in the end you might need to research a bit and find some explanations etc. But that's Madoka Magica for you! 
Overall this story has no MAJOR flaws and I cannot come to point out any cons in the plot, all in all a very solid story. Shaft never disappoints! 
ART - --/-- 
The art. Well what can I say... One word... BEAUTIFUL!!!! 
The animation in this film was simply amazing. The movie's animation  compared to the original series was a hell of a lot better and it shows in various scenes throughout. In this movie the background scenery and fighting scenes are much more detailed. Having the animation blow me away! There were also some extra scenes put in to express the darkness and depression of some scenes. Overall the art was a big step up from the series. Plain beautiful! 
SOUND - --/-- 
Madoka magica has always been one of my favorites when it comes to the OST. Yukia Kajiura defintley did not disappoint! Unlike the series, there were more scores in this movie, making it more alive and detailed. They kept the old ones in with a few new ones. Overall the soundtrack was at it's best. 
Now when it came to the voice acting in this movie, I felt that it exceeded the series, in terms of emotion, screaming and just plain voicing. Saito Chiwa (Homura's voice actress) did a fantastic job in this movie and I also did notice the voice of Madoka did a much better job compared to the original series. But that's just based on my ears! Overall voice acting was perfect! 
Character - --/-- 
I have always loved the characters in this show. The movie portrays these characters in a depressing and deep way. You learn a lot about each and every character in this movie, seeing there happy side, and dark side. Even though this movie mainly focuses on the relationship between Madoka and Homura, I did feel that some other characters got some decent development and depth put into them. But in saying that, the character you see get most development is defintley Homura. You get to see her background/back story etc. It was like this movie kind of expressed the depression and motivation Homura felt, but not only her but with all the characters. It makes you feel the emotions that are being felt in the movie. You also get to see more depth into Kyoko and what she's about. Showing scenes from her past and how she became a Magical Girl. You learn about this 'bad ass' type character a bit more. Overall characters were good. Period. 
ENJOYMENT - --/-- 
Surprisingly this movie was more enjoyable to watch than the actual anime series! It made me love the second half of the series even more, and also made me understand it a lot better! With the new addition of a beautiful soundtrack, new extra scenes and gorgeous animation, this movie is beyond good. No doubt I would recommend this show to any anime watchers! Well time to watch the next and final movie...

Honestly, I think this is one of the most overrated movies, and this is why: 
Negatives: 
There are just too many things. I know this is a pretty short movie, but because of that the movie is bad. Its just lacking so much things it shouldn't be. 
The characters are kinda okay, but you dont really get to know them and there is no real connection between the viewer and the characters. They dont really have something to work on, you don't see any of their personality, in fact they could be basically replaced by any random character of the movie (there even are not much character which make that even worse). 
The Story was something you could've shown in - minutes and to fill the whole time of the movie, the story is being pulled out to get as much out of it as possible. The sound was also nothing really special, it helped a little bit with the atmosphere, but was just average if not below the standards. 
Positives: 
What makes the movie even though there are so many negatives still better than average is the art. The movie got a beautiful design, animation and the way they convey the ideas is made well. And because of that you can enjoy the anime even though it lacks in so many different things 
Overall I'd give the movie a rating of -/--, because there are so many missing things which are very important of making a good movie. I know that this is a shorter movie than normal, but even though they didnt made it as well as could be. The people probably just like it because its a sad story of two loving people who slowly but surely have to drift apart from each other, with a message which isn't quite something special, but people yet tend to think it is. 
I apologize for my english, I'm not so good at it since this isn't my native language.

Overall, it's not the worse to watch. And it's entertaining to watch the battles, tho most aren't that lengthy. But my reason for such a low rating was due to the writing.  
The story starts out nice and interesting. Then it starts to pick up somewhere, only to drop it. We don't know anything about the main character so the following events with him aren't that enjoyable - he seems to have not be planned out well at all.  
Then we have the other ""main character"". She lacks any other characteristic than not seeming to have any mind of her own, but considerate enough not to leave someone dying. The rest of the cast is very, very one-dimensional and rather easy to guess how they'd play out - not the worse, but with this kinda lead and his sidekick of sorts ... yeah, it doesn't help anything at all.  
But after the first two big events, I didn't expect how choppy the story continued  (intro counts as just an intro btw, I'm breaking these into three events) . The first event was super small but led to the next with decent setup, and gave some very slight, vague character introduction. Then the second event legit wasted most of its time ""setting things up"" - which could've been summed up through the big fight towards the end. It would've been fine granted how little of substance there was other than obtaining the sidekick lady.  
Then, the final big event took up the second half of the film. And it wasn't worth it. This was something where you could tell they planned quite a bit. A lot, actually. But instead of utilizing it properly - BY ALLOWING THE AUDIENCE TO PIECE ANYTHING TOGETHER - they decided to just tell us everything... and, if we were lucky to have had some kinda vague hint towards it, during the ~big reveals~ towards the end.  
Again, the fights were kinda interesting. Not the worse thing there. But add that to the random ~*~belts galore~*~ lead and his sidekick, it makes little sense and truly doesn't work together. At least something to make it look like they've lived in that environment most/all of their lives would've been idealistic, apparently.  
But, yeah, no. The story itself had such weird pacing that let us not really enjoy what was happening. It's like we should've known what the lead was thinking the whole time. Even tho his character didn't make sense half the time. Especially at the very end where he decided to be a completely different character from how he'd been --% of the dang film - and here I was, assuming that had been a mere fancy act during part of the first event!!

This review covers Overlord seasons ---. 
Not really being your typical Isekai, this show is a strange black comedy that relies on fantasy stereotypes for a lot of meta-humor involving the genre's familiar trappings. Taking a lot of inspiration from D&D and popular MMOs for its worldbuilding and mechanics. 
~Story~ 
A Regular joe is transported to another world. But this time he's the evil overlord and not the hero. Known as 'Momonga', his in-game name and then later 'Ainz Ooal Gown' which he adopts to better represent his guild mates. He and his entire guild hall's assets (Including the building and NPCs) are transported over from the VR MMO game YGGDRASIL into a real fantasy world. The catch is that he alone out of all the other players were transported (The only one we know of that is), so he's the only one that knows he came from a game. 
The NPCs were granted sentience, their stats and creators influencing their personalities and every skill and item was translated over to have real-world properties. The denizens of 'The Great Tomb of Nazarick' follow their new overlord unwaveringly as he kind of sorta plans to take over this new world. But doesn't because he just wants to find his friends. 
~Art~ 
The character designs are instantly recognizable from silhouette alone. It's pleasantly surprising to have a skeleton with a strong and brutal physique be a main character for once. However, not everything is dandy. The studio tends to use heavy CGI for mass background characters, which means the battles involving armies look crude at best. 
~Sound~ 
The soundtrack is mostly serviceable with only one or two standout songs. The OP is a banger every season. Sound design wise, I encountered no problems that an unprofessional ear couldn't hear. Except for one character who's plate armor didn't clank like it should've when he walked, but I suppose he did mention it was made of magic metal made to be silent... doesn't stop it from bothering me though. 
~Character~ 
The characters are the largest problem with this show that I have. Sure the author focused all his time on worldbuilding and yeah they're supposed to be all fantasy stereotypes but even if he's lampooning them he's not doing a great job. I found them neither interesting nor entertaining. Let me explain. 
So firstly we have Ainz, the main character that starts off as a relatable everyman in a skeleton's body, but we quickly find out that his new undead physiology is giving him problems feeling empathy with humans anymore. Or in general, leaving him to commit pretty terrible acts without batting an eye. 
I feel as if the author is unsure of the direction he wants to take with the MC, as he hasn't double downed on any facet of his personality. He ends up operating in a strange twilight zone where the author is too afraid to make him too evil in fear of him being unrelatable but then making do some pretty terrible things anyway, only to mask them with 'pragmatic' excuses. Look mate. I don't care how pragmatic human experimentation, or committing mass genocide is (on a whim might I add). It's still evil. Stop beating around the bush. And don't give me a ""It's because I'm not human anymore"" excuse. That's not an excuse, that's a reason. ""Valid"" (If there even is such thing as a 'valid') excuses to be evil, like a tragic past or a change in physiology don't excuse evil acts. They just explain them. When you're the type of guy who is committing warcrimes on a whim you're either sympathetic and tragic because you've got a good heart and a relatable cause OR you're a total bastard that finds excuses to do terrible things. And Ainz is trying to get the best of both worlds by tip-toeing around the reasons he does anything. So he's supposed to be relatable AND sociopathic? That makes no sense. Pick one. I either like him because he's being so evil it's charming (Ala Freeza) or I like him because I give a damn about his suffering (Ala Darth Vader). He has the appearance and the panache but none of the substance. 
So his motivation for the first - seasons are a rather flimsy collection of goals, involving NOT taking over the world but simply: gathering intel, spreading his name around the world so other players may find him and staying covert enough that...other player's don't find him. What I don't understand is that his bumbling everyman persona clashes with his cautious but elite guild player mentality. He's smart enough to know all the mechanics of his favorite MMO inside and out, and how to wage a proper battle with another player but not smart enough to think out the consequences of his frequent overlord 'plans'. Creating many comedic scenarios where the consequences of his actions are mistaken as 'divine schemes' by his followers. 
He doesn't even want to take over the world until the -rd season when his subordinate suggests it from a comment he made by accident on the first episode. So he's actually experimented on humans, murdered people and ordered genocide all BEFORE he decided on world domination. And we're supposed to like and admire this guy or something? Well at least his subordinates do. They worship him like a god unquestionably which definitely doesn't undermine any decision or freewill they might have, we'll get to that later. 
So this not so relatable office worker in a sociopathic skeleton god's body, grinded an MMO for countless hours and is now the indisputable lord and master of the new world he's transported in. All his power, all his assets, everything he's acquired he's got from playing a video game with his friends. Which kind of robs him of any overlord-like admiration that I would naturally have for a character that had the cunning to achieve their position. Everytime he does his signature anime power level flex, all I see is a nerd showing off his trophies to a bunch of hapless bystanders.  
And in the end he doesn't come off very sympathetic or admirable because of his situation and actions. Then what is he? He's charismatic enough to at least trick people that he's a good leader, since we receive a lot of his internal monologues that reveal he's more a goof than anything. A goof with too much power for his own good. And I'd know that, because a goof that knows he's lost sympathy for the human race but is rational enough not to commit murder so that he may have a clear conscious upon returning to his own world wouldn't of killed this many people this far in. His sociopathy undermines any endearing traits he has and the author's constant reaching for viewer sympathy with him undermines any verbose villainy he may achieve if he just doubled down on his hypocrisy and went full crazy. 
As an evil overlord, he's in the far less entertaining boat than his other, better contemporaries. He's not as tragic enough as Darth Vader or verbose and magnificently evil as Freeza. He's the worst of both worlds and it makes me not care for him. He doesn't OWN his villainy he doesn't get shit DONE like other villains. Frankly I don't think the author knows what makes a villain fun. Admittedly, him frequently bumbling about is a great source of humor for the show, that it does exploit frequently. But it's not funny enough to hold the whole thing together. He doesn't even struggle enough for me to want to see him try. Unless you like powerful character for the sheer sake that they're powerful than you're not going to find much here to like. The main character has ended up as just another wet noodle Isekai protagonist who flexes in much the same manner, except with the tables switched on the side he's on. 
Y'know what? There's no time to explain why the side characters are just as poor. Ainz was the best character they had and he still sucked. But I'll just sum it up here: you have two types of side characters, the ones that have no power and can't effect the plot in any meaningful way but we spend tons of time following them around anyway and the ones that DO have power but have no free will to act upon it because they're enslaved to Ainz. One character in particular: Sebas demonstrates this to its most egregious extreme when his loyalty and morality is called into question. During a farely standard arc where we discover that he has conlicting values with the rest of the NPCs because of his moral code we hit a climax where he must decide what is more valuable: His loyalty or his love? Is he a man? or is he a slave? Well he's a slave. Because we find out that he'd rather throw away any moral code he had just because skeletor told him so. Making him substantially less interesting. No Sebas goes 'John Wick' on Nazarick arc for us. Just boring old status quo. 
Any point the author is trying to achieve with his characters is just not making the cut. I don't care what happens to these characters. When Ainz kills another set of adventurers because they looked at Nazarick funny, I just don't care as much as I should. Neither for the adventurers or for Ainz. I know the outcome already, and it's not that funny, not that epic, and not that tragic. All I see is potential for something greater and plenty of missed opportunities. 
~Enjoyment~ 
As a conventional story, Overlord doesn't hold up very well. Even as a sort of meta black comedy about fantasy cliches, in a world where One Punch Man exists, a super hero parody that lampoons many of the tropes its genre in much the same way; it's neither as funny, as epic or as surprisingly touching as its superhero counterpart can be. As a conventional story, it lacks the character conflict, substance, stakes or impact that any good story would actually have. The potential for amazing conflict is so juicy here it's frustrating to not see it utilized. So whatever it's doing, it's completely missed the mark for me. 
~Overall~ 
The worldbuilding was just interesting enough to keep me going to the end of season - (I'm a sucker for fantasy) and it was *just* funny enough to make me snicker when Demiurge mistook Ainz' intentions for the -rd time in a row. But I'm not holding my breath for a -th installment. Especially if I'll be getting much the same. Maybe it will hold your attention for longer if you learn to like the chuuni-power-fantasy element that takes itself too seriously. If you're really starved for some typical high fantasy world dressing with a twist on its perspective than I guess this is a decent pick.

Spoilers up ahead 
ONE has done it again, Studio Bones has done it again. Mob Psycho --- II is one of the best shows ever made. It is a great example of a character driven story with incredible animation, heart warming moments, great comedy and well done character interactions. 
Story -: 
The story is quite simple and well done, the way Claw and other story threads are woven together to make a clear and coherent is well done. Generally it has a simple premise of daily occurrences in Mob's world. A school marathon, performing jobs for the Spirits and Such Consultation Office, failure to adapt to new things. And then brought to a thrilling and satisfying conclusion with the head of Claw and his ideology facing Mob's. 
Art --: 
Studio Bones has once again saved anime with the level of skill in the art. Episode - stands out as having one of the most amazing battles in anime with solely it's artistic aspect. However through the rest of the series as the animation style is consistently at a very high standard, and follows ONE's drawings. Also the lapses in the continuous art style for comedic effect are well done and also fit their role. Some of the best art in anime in this show. 
Sound -: 
Extremely good voice acting that fits well and is believable, Dimple's voice actor especially at the end of episode -. This leads to a more consistent experience where I can easily suspend my disbelief. The sound effects are also well done. 
Character --: 
The highlight of this show is the characters and their own arcs. Reigen's arc especially good with his understanding how he could not hold on Mob forever and learning that the hard way. Mob constantly trying his hardest to be the best without his powers. Mob also being forgiving to everyone he can, trying to shine a light on things. And also his clash with the head of Claw's ideology, that fight showed what Mob is really about, whether you are part of the world or above it. It also carries on the superiority complex from the main villains of last season and applies it on a broader sense. Also what's more the villains from last time have reflected on their misdeeds and are now correcting themselves as part of society. 
Enjoyment --: 
Mob has a lot on the surface to enjoy, the fights, the animation, the comedy. But it also has a more implicit deeper meaning to explore. I really enjoy seeing what shows have to offer in their ""philosophy"" and found that Mob provided it in abundance. There was much to enjoy with that and a great show to go along with that. 
Overall --: 
Mob Psycho --- II has made its way into my number - spot of all time thanks to everything that went into it. Truly deserving of the -+ it has on MAL, (at the time of writing this). This show is sure to become a classic down the years.

Coming into this as someone who hasn't read the manga, watched any of the movies, etc., this was a great way to get me hooked on the series. I plan on reading the manga because of this show. 
Character design and development is where Berserk shines the brightest. I felt like I was a part of the Band of the Hawk as I watched their journey unfold, and the last few episodes would not have nearly as much of an impact if it weren't for the fact that I developed somewhat of an emotional attachment to these characters. Guts, Griffith and Casca are stand outs particularly, you definitely see growth in various ways in each of them. The pacing of the show helps with this a lot as well; the overall structure doesn't feel rushed or drawn out and everything that was shown felt like it had a purpose. 
The art style is good and the animation is fine, nothing particularly special to me, and I can't speak for how accurate this show is to its portrayal of events in the manga. THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAAAAAZING. The intro/outro songs are some of my favorite songs I've been introduced to through anime. 
Overall, I think this is a really, really great show. I honestly only started to watch it because I had a friend tell me the end of it was insane (which is an understatement) and I wanted to get the full affect. I wasn't expecting to find one of my favorite anime/manga characters (Guts, duh) from this, nor was I expecting to feel emotionally distraught afterward, but here I am.

Hey kids! Ever wanted a compilation movie that is completely worthless, not adding anything of note and just a complete waste of almost two hours of your life!? Well, fear not! For as Evangelion: Death And Rebirth is here for you!... Yeah this movie sucks. 
Applying my usual compilation movie review format, but first and foremost I must ask: Why the hell is it just one movie? The show is -- episodes long, and even if you wanna discount the last two episodes, that’s still -- episodes worth of material to cover. If you wanna do a compilation movie out of EVA, you’d need a flat out trilogy: The first one covering everything up to the fight with Ramiel, the second up to the moment Unit--- Eats the S- Engine, and the final one covering everything up to Kaworu’s death. Think the Rebuild movie without all the changes they made. 
So how does this movie do this? Well, not well. This is basically an elongated recap episode. At the time there was some nobelty in seeing it as there were some new scenes, but since then they have all been added to the Director’s Cut of episodes -----, making this movie effectively worthless. This movie could be summed up as “This is a character; here’s that character’s deal; moving on to the next one”. Rinse and repeat for a whole hour and you’ve got this movie. 
But wait! You might say. That is only the Death part of this movie! What about Rebirth!? Well, simple: Rebirth is just the first -- or so minutes of End Of Evangelion. No, seriously, that’s it. The original Japanese Release did have some frames that were different from the final product, but otherwise… yeah, it’s just the beginning of End Of EVA. 
So did anything good come out of this movie? Well, the new scenes are nice, but as I said, they have been added to the show proper. Also, the Ending Theme, “Tamashi No Refuran” is amazing, but… yeah, that’s it really. There really isn’t much else to this movie. The only reason you should watch it is if you for some reason took forever to watch EOE and needed a refresher. Besides that, this movie is WORTHLESS! So worthless my review of it was bound to be so short because there’s that little to comment on, and that is not a compliment! 
Final Score: -/--

One Piece Movie --: Strong World Review 
Story (-/--) Very Good 
More Specifically (-.--/--) Very Good+ 
The --th One Piece Strong World Movie was finally the One Piece Movie I was waiting to see which is something within these One Piece movies worth calling a movie quality presentation. The Story for Strong World is very simple with a lot of adaptations and setups before the movie even coming out a prequel OVA, a manga adaptation by Oda and even some filler setup episodes within the One Piece anime during the Impel Down Arc. I think for a movie this accomplish what it set out to do. 
Art and Animation (-/--) Great 
Finally some eye candy in One Piece by Toei. One Piece Strong World I was told is one of the best things One Piece animated and I have to agree it does look really really nice. It barely reach movie quality yes but that's not taking anything away from it because this is Toei we are talking about. The animation and art style for this movie is great and I heard the only other film that look this good if not better is Film Z, I'll be the judge of that but for right now Strong World is the best thing One Piece animated in my opinion. 
Sound (--/--) Masterpiece 
Glad the movie got an English dub so I can focus on the nice visuals this movie brought to us. The jungle music played through out this movie and even during the outro fit this movie perfectly and all the theme music of the characters when they are doing their thing (Zoro theme and Sanji's theme to be exact) we're welcomed and only made their shining moments that much cooler to me. 
Characters (--/--) Great  
The Straw Hats were depicted perfectly in this movie and rightfully so since Oda created the script for this one. Everyone got their shine here, Shiki and his two main minions were entertaining every time they took the screen the clown and hit farting shoes made laugh everytime he walked and the pervery gorilla was quite funny as well. Shiki himself is a hyped up and strong villian and he proves that in their first battle against them not many villains could wipe the floor of majority of the Straw Hat crew with that much of an ease (whether they were fully ready or not). Other new characters like Billy the Duck were entertaining as well being a duck the discharges electricity reminded me of Pikachu and it fit well with the Rubberman Luffy that duck is such a good character I wanted him to be apart of the crew permanently.  
Enjoyment (-/--) Very Good 
More Specifically (-.--/--) Very Good+ 
My enjoyment for this movie was very good. It did help that it was in dub but even if it wasn't my view on the movie wouldn't have change that's just a plus. The entire movie was entertaining from beginning to enter and that's saying a lot because no One Piece movie so far has accomplished that.  
Overall (-/--) Great 
More Specifically (-.--/--) Great 
Strong World lived up to the hype that was given to it. I can definitely slap my seal of approval on this one if anything. I knew Toei could adapt something great if they felt like it and this is proof.

If there is such thing as the perfect movie, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is it. 
The main protagonist, Kyon, has to make the most difficult decision of his life. Does he want to live in a world with aliens, time travelers, and espers, or does he want to live a normal high school life. 
To watch this movie, you must watch the first two Seasons of Haruhi Suzumiya. 
Anyways, the art that is shown in this movie is beautiful, the plot is purely original, the characters are like real people. 
If you enjoyed the Haruhi Suzumiya anime series, imagine the series - times better, that's just how amazing this movie is.

All I can say is that I am very satisfied with this movie. Mikiya finally did it! Mikiya and Shiki made a daughter! I am so happy! 
The art is very good, the character design seems to be the same, but the background art and animation is better. In fact it is so eye-catchingly good. 
There isn't too much action for Shiki in this movie unlike the other Kara no Kyoukai movies, but in just that little action this movie has to offer, it completely showed how badass Shiki is, she is almost, if not, godlike! She is so OP and I like it! 
On the other hand, Mikiya has a harem... yes... you will see it if you watch it. 
The soundtrack is good, I like the ending song. The background music is very good, the timing is great and it also suits the situations very well.

Overview: 
Although I feel DBZ Movie -: ""Lord Slug"" is the worst DBZ movie, DBZ Movie -: Cooler's Return AKA ""Clash of of -- Billion Powerful Warriors"" is another one of the - truly awful DBZ movies. This is the movie I will be discussing today, before wrapping up my trilogy of reviews with DBZ Movie --: Bio Broly. 
Plot: -/-- 
Warning Spoiler!!!  
The general consensus is that Cooler's Return has the single worst plot of any DBZ movie. I fully agree with this conclusion. After being blasted into the Sun with a Kamehameha, A small fracture of Cooler's skull including his eye has somehow managed to escape the Sun's tremendous gravity and travel an unbelievable distance into deep interstellar space. In the void of interstellar space, the skull fragment collides with a super advanced alien computer chip, which is drifting way out in deep space because...reasons. This computer chip uses Cooler's remaining brain (even though we can see VERY little if any brain survived) to construct a giant mass called the ""Big Gete Star"" out of astroids and self replicating nano-machines. This giant, grey blob called the Big Gete Star happened to be near the new Planet Namek, so Cooler took control of the Gete star and commanded it to attach on to Namek like a giant tumor and drain the planet's energy. Even if we were to buy the bullshit about Cooler's skull fragment escaping the Sun's gravity, how in the HOLY FUCK did the skull fragment travel far enough to be near New Namek when it collided with the computer chip!!? New Namek wasn't even located in the same quadrant of the Universe as Earth. If you were to divide the entire Universe into - giant chunks, this is another quadrant and probably BILLIONS of LIGHT YEARS away! In less than - year, Cooler's skull fragment with no ""warp drive"" or teleportation managed to travel a couple Billion light years distance! Even by the idiotic standards of DBZ, that is fucking preposterous!!! At the same time Cooler's blob attacks Namek, the Z fighters just happen to be on vacation there using a ship....even though it was an important plot point in the Future Saga that they had no idea where it was in the series and only Goku could travel there using ""Instant Transmission"", which locks onto a Ki signature and teleports to that Ki source. The Z fighters then fight against Cooler and his clones in order to save New Namek. 
Action: -/-- 
Goku and Vegeta fight against an army of Mecha-Cooler clones and the rest of the Z fighters all fight against lame cyclops robots. I will give this movie credit for being the only DBZ movie in which our heroes must fight a massive army instead of a single powerful opponent. That was actually a kind of neat idea. I also give it credit for including more of the other Z fighters and giving them a tad of action instead of JUST getting their asses kicked in - minutes. Unfortunately, we don't actually get to see the fight between the Cooler Army and Goku/Vegeta. I'm serious! The fucking movie fades to black and we see Goku and Vegeta tied up inside the Big Gete Star after presumably being beat up offscreen. Cooler attempts to drain their energy, but apparently they still have so much energy left that it overloads the computer's systems and causes the Gete Star to explode along with all the Coolers. That's really what happens! This is by far the STUPIDEST villain death in all of DBZ. It isn't satisfying, it is completely anti-climactic, and it wasn't even given any kind of foreshadowing or anything to make it acceptable. 
Animation and music: 
Like with Lord Slug, the animation and music are average here. They aren't terrible, but not notable either. The only interesting sequence of animation in this movie is Cooler using nano-machines to regenerate parts of his body after repeatedly getting blown apart. That...actually looked kind of awesome! Other than that, I don't really have any praise left. 
Overall: 
Deciding which is worse between Lord Slug and Cooler's Return is a VERY difficult decision, but I think Cooler's Return is the SLIGHTLY better movie for a few reasons. Firstly, the movie at least had the concept of the Z warriors fighting a massive army of opponents, which DBZ honestly had never tried before this point and never really tried again until the new movie ""Resurrection of F"". Secondly, at least Cooler looked a lot...well...cooler than Lord Slug! Despite just being a watered down version of Freeza's character with no independent personality traits, quirks, or anything to set him apart besides an extra transformation, fans of DBZ actually LIKE Cooler. He kind of looks badass and gives us another member of Freeza's unusual race, which we learn VERY little about during the manga or anime. It is hinted in the anime filler that Freeza's race is the ""Arcosians"" that North Kai said gave the Saiyans their technology and ran the Planet Trade Organization. Although this has never been stated in the manga or confirmed by Akira Toriyama himself. Lord Slug on the other hand, is just a lame ripoff of King Piccolo that NO ONE thinks is badass and no one actually wants to learn more about his character. That is why Cooler got - different movies and Lord Slug only got -. Of course Broli got - because he is BY FAR the most popular movie villain. Lastly, this was the first DBZ movie to take place away from Earth and set the stage for the vastly superior Movie -. All previous DBZ movies used the same formula of: evil dude comes to Earth and Z warriors must kill him. This movie at least ""sort of"" broke the mold and allowed a TINY bit more creativity to go into DBZ movies, which ultimately allowed for the zany, off the wall fun of future movies like DBZ Movie --: Fusion Reborn. Conclusion: This isn't a good movie by ANY stretch of the imagination, but it isn't quite as bad as Lord Slug. If you are a diehard DBZ completionist and feel the need to watch this movie, just relax and try not to think too hard!

Now onto the very controversial School Days. School Days isn't your average slice of life romance where the character never chooses a girl. In fact, Makoto, the main protagonist, makes the choice of getting all of them. 
Story: -/-- 
School Days has the advantage of having no plot holes whatsover. Moreover, its story manages to piss off the viewer in less than - episodes making it a torture to watch.  After seeing it, you'll even find Guilty Crown good. Its pure awesomeness resides in the fact that once the story is settled you cannot feel anything but hatred towards this anime if you haven't dropped it yet that is. I love how the story has no incoherent developpement (except for the characters but I'll talk about it later) and even manages to please the viewer with its awesome ending. Personnally, I couldn't do anything but love the way School Days ended; it was a burst of freedom. 
Art: -/- 
The art is just bad. I mean, even for a ---- anime, the girls aren't even cute and the backgrounds look sooooo freaking rushed. 
Sound: -/- 
Bad OST, bad OP, bad ED (did it even have one?). I mean, since the story wasn't great, I didn't expect much in the artistic domain and guess what ? I didn't get much ! 
Character: -/-- 
Why can't I rate it -! The characters in School Days are beyond illogical. It isn't the sort of ""illogical"" humans can be, it's beyond that. They act in random ways. The character developpement is present within the first few episodes and then it becomes a senseless massacre. The way the chararacters interacted with Makoto was incoherent. Girls went to bed too easily. The script was written in such a bad way, and it is easy to see that it crumbles - episodes into the anime. There is still a sub-plot which stays good until it ends but that's about it. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
I've never harbored such feelings of hatred towards an anime. I have to praise School Days for making me feel something while watching it. I quite 'liked' how it pictured the vile human nature but it wasn't  realistic enough for me to buy it. 
Overall: -.-/-- 
A lot of anime come of as average and are easily forgetten but that isn't the case with School Days. This rollercoaster of nothingness manages to make you hate the main protagonist so much and pity all the girls. Kenji was right, it's a conspiracy. 
Well, that's about it for School Days. Also, no offense but people who say School Days is good because it is a psychological anime are just fucking with you or are trying to play smart. There may be some people who genuinely appreciated this anime but I don't think they are numerous. 
Have a nice time watching it, that is if you ever want to watch it.

I legitimately felt like watching a romance anime, so when I found this I was like ''why not?'' Big mistake. This is like a bad undercover hentai. The sex scenes are shit and there is no character development. It was almost like the person who made this was like, '' Oh, what if we made a hentai that didn't seem like a hentai so more people could watch it where all the sex scenes are the same with them wearing different clothes and being unemotional-pleasure-seeking robots that didn't have personalities.'' This was one crap anime. The art was off and there were honestly times where I thought the dude had a hole through his face because of horrible shadows. The storyline was lacking in every compartment and I hardly understood what was going on. I feel that if they weren't going to make a proper storyline the sex should at least be great, but it wasn't. 
In other words, this is crap, don't watch it.

After finishing this series, I felt so overwhelmed that I figured I had to dedicate my first anime review to Steins;Gate. I started watching this anime because of two reasons, -. The ratings were too good to be true; -. I like time-travelling and scifi genres. So to begin I was already harbouring high expectations for this anime.  
I had read somewhere that the first few episodes were more sliceoflife typed rather than thriller, and true enough, in the first few episodes we are introduced to the various characters, and we learn about their antics, their behaviours, and them as a whole. The character development in Steins;Gate is beautifully done and unlike half-assed supporting characters, we are rewarded with well-designed and realistic character personality and premises that make each and everyone of them unique and essential in bringing this anime to life.  
When watching the first few episodes, you may feel like giving up because the story is admittedly slightly boring at the beginning, adopting a slower pace without much sci-fi and thriller that we all came looking for when we decided to watch this anime. HOWEVER, DO NOT STOP WATCHING. I cannot repeat this enough. Your patience will be rewarded at the end and things only get better and better.  
Steins;Gate is one of the few shows that have managed to blow my mind away with its amazing, detailed and well-planned storyline that makes you go EUREKA I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING NOW with just a single revelation at the very end. It does this magic where it doesn't straight out tell you in exposition, but it reveals it in a way where you are involved first-handedly and you experience the same emotions the characters are going through.  
Now being a fanatic over this whole concept of time travelling, I'm not easily satisfied with just another time travel story that's plot is most often overused, confusing, contradictory and straight out poorly executed. BUT Steins;Gate has done this brilliant feat whereby it has set fixed rules about the way time works on its world and how things are affected by it. Additionally, the story was quoted to be ""--% science and -% fiction"" and it is true to a large extent because the theories used in Steins'Gate are backed by actual theories that are widely believed in the science world. This anime also reminds me of the movie Interstellar, so if you enjoy Interstellar, you will enjoy this too.  
(slight spoilers) 
Finally, although this isn't a romance genre anime, a beautiful tragic love story is smartly masked under the façade of a sci-fi movie. The relationships and interactions between okabe, mayuri and kurisu is done so well that you can't help but be pained by the circumstances that okabe has to go through.  
Overall, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS ANIME.

Although only -- minutes long, it's all the anime needed. It was able to unfold it's self slowly and give you enough time to to feel the scene and understand it. The film portrayed yet another unbreakable bond that humans can have as well as yet another example of how they don't last. The true meaning of love can be seen in this short film, for it wasn't based on attraction but friendship ""the best of friendships evolve into love""

the writer or plot remained true per-say. I say that for after first episode it continue in the second right where episode - left off. However, when episode - ended it was followed with a to be continued. Granted, that could have been error, lack of funds, an indication of Within the Bloody Woods -, or anything. So, to be fair i will give the benefit of the doubt and not show too much critique in that retrospect. Although, would have been nice if it was a couple of those listed above if they went back in episode - and changed it. 
I would say more but that is all i liked. 
Dislikes 
sound: it was nice to hear a natural English speaker for a change. Although, that speaker should have been canned from the get go. The only reason to have kept him was for a character that is either caught in a time dilemma, smoking weed, 'special' character, not a character whom is faced with evil. I think that is the main reason why this horror did not scare me. For it was very clear on the ears the vocalist did not have good enthusiasm . just saw this as another paycheck. ""oh i have to read this? Okay, how much will i get paid? That much?! So, little. *demonstrates sadness in the vocal reading.""  
Intro to the art was rather choppy on both episodes. I.e. the frame rate was slow. Felt similar to watching an old t.v. i wanted to pound the screen to make it go faster. 
p.s. if you want a beginner's horror and are not really grossed on obvious fake blood i would go with this. otherwise, have a nice day somewhere else.

This is a very mediocre anime  
Its not good but not a total flop well to me at least. there were moments where they tried to involve you into the story, the setting, the somewhat ""epic"" battlefield between the warlords and well zombie-like monsters but the way they presented it was really boring. 
None of the characters were really memorable at all, heck even after forcing myself through the anime i can barely remember - or - characters and the only reason i can remember the mc's name is because they wouldn't shut up about her. Sure i get that she is the mc and all but she took up so much screen time that the other boys barely have any character development at all, even when they do get their screen time, most of it felt boring. Another thing is that everytime the mc take the stage, she is either playing that same old innocent virgin-like nice girl role or being the damsel in distress making her more like a liability rather than someone you would love and want to protect. 
What really killed it for me is that once again another animal sidekick is considered useless

This movie is where it really makes you think about life and what true ""happiness"" is.  
If it's too long just read the last paragraph, I honestly get tired of reading long reviews too lol. 
So when I first watched this, I was unaware that it was a Studio Ghibli work just because of the fact that the art style was so foreign. It was a soft, hand drawn paper pencil style and honestly, I never watch any of them before I watch this one. But as you watch, you can understand that the artistic style choice was so well adapted with the story and fit very well with everything that goes on.  
The story it self comes from an old folk tale about a bamboo cutter but it has a more of an emotional adaptation to it. Much of the story contains a subtle development of the main character and has a very ""warm"" and child storybook like feeling. However, one thing that did really bug me was the fact that the ending was very choppy. Yes, it did make me cry, but it still was cut off so randomly which made me fell a bit...lost as in if felt as if the story was left unfinished.  
Personally, I don't like it when the story does not have a finalized ending and leaves as an ""open-ending"". But this is just a personal pet peeve and you might find it very like-able that is does this.  
Oh the MUSIC!. It is marvelous, Much of the soundtrack is very Japanese traditional sounds but there is one scene from the movie that had the Princess laughing and the music made if truly feel how beautiful she was portrayed.  
And speaking of the Princesses, the character was very intricately woven. Though some characters were your typical ""bad guys"" (not really) who I really wanted to focus on was the main character itself. Though t may seem she is very two-dimensional, it subsequently shows each side of her character, and I found that she was the most complexly made character in the whole movie.  
So if you plan to watch it look for that and it's super cool. 
Overall it was fantastic, the art style really grows on you and though it seems a little boring and slow for some who likes things fast paced, this is one where you sit down with your hot coco in your bed with the rain outside and just relax to enjoy life. 
Ya it's those kind of movie. It's great.

Bakuman is one of the anime/manga series which describe the manga itself, about the rating,the hardship, etc. It was a great show to watch, it gave us knowledge and also the - main character have great teamwork which is refreshing unlike every other cliche animes where MC best friend is for comedic purpose only.  
Before i start this review please take a few note: 
-.This review is for ALL bakuman series 
-.This review might contain spoiler for -st& -nd season 
Bakuman, one of my most favourite anime and is great to watch. Its story is about a young man named Mashiro and Takagi who want to reach their dream and want to be a mangaka.  
The -st season is about one of the manga they made got into serialization. The -nd introduce us some funny character and how they make another manga that could surpass his work before and get anime adaptation to marry the girl he love. The -rd season cover the story completely with a great character development betweeen the MC and the main heroines. 
One of the greatest strength of this anime is not the story, it is the uniqueness and the knowledge. Its so goddamn unique that ppl will not forget about it. Rather than reading wiki and google nowaday, there's an anime that resolve around the production of the manga, staff etc it become an anime that even if we didnt like a single bit of it story, gave us sufficient knowledge and entertaiment. Along with funny side character, the story become fun and not boring. They tolerate the repetitive plot in this story, that make me feel that each one of them is important (except that one motherfucker i'll explain later). So to summarize, the story is unique, pretty much filler free, and one that can make you laugh your ass off. (--/--) 
The art is nothing unique, nothing new but not bad either. Well its pretty bad if you compare to nowadays animation like ufotable one, oh wait...   
I'd like to give the art (-/--) 
Sound.... -st opening is boring -nd one is decent, others are pretty much average for me. Someone might get angry for this but the OP and ED didnt really work for this. The OST, i didnt remember any except when mashiro hold azuki hand... (-/--) 
Now we get to the part i hate the most. Character. 
The main character(- main protagonist) is doing great at the -st season but at the -nd they pretty much controlled by a shit editor, i mean shit. That kind of person that didnt know anything but take everything as an ""OK this will work for sure"". But honestly at the -nd season the worst character is not him, it is the main characters itself. Why did they agree on everything he told. Once Takagi rebel him but the next time, they agreed to him and make everything worse. Their rival which is a fan didnt even read them. And with --th ranking in weekly spot why the fuck this - MCs still continue to believe what the editor said. If they really are aiming for anime and also smart enough to stand with a genious in manga, why cant they think about it, about who is right and who is wrong. The -rd season is fine because finally our Hattori is back 
Put that shithead aside, lets get to the side characters. The are not really any antagonist in this series. Niizuma eiji is a protagonist too,and also hope that Ashirogi Mutou to succes. So with no main antagonist (there is - but got wiped so quickly)this series is doing really fine, i mean GREAT. Every side character is fun to watch. Fukuda is unique of its style.Eiji is genius. Hiramaru is... everyone favourite i guess. Others too , even nakai become likeable character at the end. -rd season also introduced to some char, and they all cool and unique too 
BUT, The side char overpower main char in either comedy, romance and actions. Comedy? take a look at Hiramaru. Romance? Take a look at Hiramaru. Action? Take a look at Fukuda team when blockade TRAP. They are seriously great in every single section. Each side character take one main role, either is for comedy,or rival, or leadership. Then what is the main character really stand out for? The answer is dedication and seriousness also strategy. But some side own this as well thats why i think the MCs in this show arent strong enough 
Oh and Azuki is a plot device i mean smiling device at -st season, she just need to check  email and smile at -st season, -nd she finally get stronger and -rd season she become a star on its own. Sadly the star isnt strong enough to make this anime become a great romance anime as well 
Enjoyment --/-- aside from char and repetitive story this series succeed in entertaining me so Overall ill still give it a -/--, a near perfect anime 
Thx for reading

Quite a sweet story, unfortunately there were a few points that brought it down for me. First was the lack of dialogue. I mean there are points where no characters are talking. Like period. They're just doing their own thing. I found the series to feel slow at times due to this. I believe there could have a lot more emotion in the story, especially with the friends. I also believe matched with a soundtrack this could have been even better as well. Would I watch it again? Not on my own. But I'm not opposed to watching it with someone who hasn't.

This show was definitely a roller coaster for my opinions for characters. This show does something fairly well, and to me it made me consider and reconsider which characters I liked and disliked. Throughout the show the land and sea people slowly start to get along, and feelings of love are in the air. At fist glace the show takes on a love triangle type of feeling, but I was glad that the triangle actually started to fade away. One thing that did bother me was that some scenes try a little too hard to make you feel inthe moment. 
Story; The story was alright, I enjoyed the team work that the land and sea people brought forth to accomplish a goal, which both land and sea hoped for the same outcome. As the show reaches episode -- or so there is a new story to be told. The story is mainly about feelings of love and friendship. 
Art; I was actually really surprised on how amazing the art was all all throughout the show. The tiniest details to some of the designs, and even the designs alone were top notch for just a love story. 
Characters; The characters were great, even if some of them come off as a little stereotypic for an anime. The whole ""Who loves who"" thing for the characters was a little interesting considering their feelings actually change throughout the show.  
Small Spoiler 
The end was just a tad bit unsatisfying. Sure it was a happy ending and all but it ended so conveniently that it was just a little odd. I know there are others who love the show and will probably want to justify how the ending was beautiful, I understand. These reviews are all just opinions anyway. 
Overall I wanted to rate -.-, The show wasn't so amazing to get an - but wasn't plain enough to get a - or less. 
Pros; Beautiful art and design, characters progress 
Cons, Some scenes try a little too hard to make you feel for the moment.

What is God's name happened? Was this even TRYING to follow the manga? At...all?  
At the very end of Doki!!, Ikuto leaves. You've just quite possibly lost a lot of the fanbase for that. But, that's understandable, that's actually apart of the manga. I watched the first episode, and immediately knew this would be all filler. 
I was right.  
But, let's think positively, shall we?   
What I liked... 
-Pretty transformations.  
-Good graphics. 
Well, positivity can only last you so far. 
What I didn't... 
-Ikuto is gone.  
-The two new kids.  
-None of the issues/promises were resolved/fulfilled. [Nagihiko, Kairi, Amu's choice between her two boys, etc. I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen the show - the first two seasons are good, watch those.]  
-Pucci Pucci. [omg, what the heck WAS THAT?] 
--&-- were the only ones I managed to enjoy fully.  
Shugo Chara's changing of studios was a bad thing. I think this entire season could have been flung out the window, and replaced with a - hour movie. I still think they need a movie to resolve some of the issues. 
In the mean time, read the manga, please.

""No matter how much I keep lowering my expectations, I still end up disappointed"" 
That one sentence sums up the ongoing experience of watching this anime from start to finish. 
Grisaia no Kajitsu is undoubtedly one of the most successful and popular visual novels in recent years. It is a game praised for having a godlike character cast, excellent production value, great comedy, extreme lewdness and an abnormal amount of psychological depth and serious storylines for a harem series. Sounds like the perfect recipe for something to make an anime out of, right? Well three and a half years after the original visual novel was released, it finally happened. However unlike its source material, this anime adaptation of Kajitsu fails in essentially every single department other than the animation, and instead serves as one of the biggest train wrecks I've seen in a long time. 
Grisaia no Kajitsu is the story of a little group of teenagers with problems. Said problems are generally some kind of psychological trauma or other type of darker past that in the end results in the person being unable to fit into society anymore. Introducing Mihama Academy, a specially funded high-school dedicated solely in order to educate students that find themselves unable to go to any ""normal"" schools any longer. 
And as a result, they're all a bunch of crazy people. The characters of Grisaia are very unique and completely wacky. Because of their complicated backgrounds, not a single one of them is acting like a normal person, and consequently they give you an extremely unpredictable flow of events whenever they interact with each other. Together they make up one of the most unique setup of main characters you'll ever see, and that's exactly what makes them so likable. Unfortunately however, this anime doesn't give them much of a chance to showcase it. 
Case in point: this anime is rushed. Incredibly rushed. Actually the word rushed is not even enough to explain just how much of a complete and utter mess the pacing of this so-called ""adaptation"" truly is. The mere idea of trying to cover about -- hours' worth of visual novel content in a ---episode anime is nothing short of ridiculous to begin with but here it was actually attempted, and unsurprisingly it failed miserably. The first three episodes show some promise, when the anime is merely showing the hilarious everyday antics that the characters are pulling off during their school days. After that however, as soon as the story gets into its serious elements, things rapidly start derailing, and it *never ever stops derailing*. 
Michiru's and Makina's routes skip huge amounts of content, leaving out key plot elements and just leaves you feeling extremely confused and unsatisfied as a viewer. You also immediately lose all sense of time as sometimes the story pulls a sudden time skip out of nowhere and tries to proceed as if everything's all fine and dandy, despite having just left out several hours' worth of story. Sachi's and Yumiko's routes are even worse, they sincerely get *one* episode each to cover their *entire* story arcs. We're talking --+ hours of content in *one* episode each. Since this feat is pretty much impossible, the production team's so-called ""solution"" to this is to simply flat-out cut away --% of the story and pretend that the rest of the plot just doesn't exist, and unbelievably enough they on top of that even take the time to add totally nonsensical original content of their own into the mix. Especially Yumiko's route might just get the award as the worst adaptation of anything I've ever seen to be perfectly blunt. Finally Amane's route which is generally the most popular and praised one of the visual novel is fortunately also the only one that receives some sort of tolerable adaptation here, but sadly it's way too late to be enough to save this disaster of an anime. 
The ones responsible for this whole mess are none other than Studio -bit; famous for ""illustrious"" works such as Walkure Romanze as well as both seasons of Infinite Stratos. It would not be an exaggeration to say that people did not have a whole lot of faith in them even before Grisaia began airing, and unfortunately as it turns out; that was not an incorrect mindset at all. If there's one thing I have to give them credit for though, it's that the animation quality of this anime is still very high despite everything else. The characters and the environments both look great. Fans of the Monogatari Series will also notice the awfully familiar-looking character designs, which is quite simply explained by the fact that they are done by the same artist. The anime also utilizes a pretty interesting extreme-widescreen resolution that probably makes the show look a lot better if you have a really wide monitor. 
Another thing -bit apparently decided to randomly add to this show... was fanservice. Now don't get me wrong, Grisaia is incredibly lewd even in its original form but there's a very clear difference here. What the visual novel primarily contains is a myriad of hilarious sexual innuendos that were all clearly written by someone with taste and a good sense of humour. The anime however has virtually none of this. Instead, it goes with the age-old approach of throwing in random panty shots whenever possible, regardless of where or when. The problem is that this is not just a generic ecchi series, so when these spontaneous panty shots are shoved into the camera during life-or-death situations when the rest of the story is actually trying to be serious, it doesn't exactly feel very appropriate. Did the animators never stop to think that this might be *somewhat* out of place? Like really? 
The voice acting is all-round very impressive. The same cast used in the original game makes a comeback for the anime and helps liven up their respective characters immensely. Especially Makina's and Michiru's respective voice actresses make a phenomenal performance in my opinion given how incredibly wacky those two roles in particular are. It's just a shame that the anime doesn't really give them a whole lot of time to showcase it since it's so incredibly rushed. The soundtrack there is very little to say about however: while the OST does its job at enhancing the atmosphere in more or less every scene, it is definitely nothing memorable either. The opening and various ending themes are the same story: decent, but nothing special. 
Overall, the production value is solid but it's nowhere even close to making up for how incredibly butchered the story in this anime is. If you've played the original visual novel, then watching this anime is nothing but painful. It's like a guilt trip where you start every new episode holding a slight glimmer of hope that things might get better, but end up just as disappointed as the week before every single time. Seeing such a great source material dissected and ripped apart like this just hurts, and I wouldn't recommend anyone who liked the visual novel to watch this anime for their own sakes, at least not if they're expecting a legitimate adaptation. Though if you just think of it as some sort of fan fiction or similar, then it might be okay. If you have never played the visual novel however nor plan to, then this particular issue will not exist as you won't have anything to compare the anime to, so the show is not quite as bad in that case. However then you're still faced with the issue of the blitzkrieg pacing of this show which ends up eagerly skipping past its own plot points, and as a result you'll have some serious problems trying to figure out just what the hell is going on every so often. You might not be aware of what the holes are leaving out, but you'll still sure as hell notice that there are in fact holes more or less everywhere. It's just that blatantly obvious. 
This anime has been the source of a lot of pain and agony for many people over the last few months. In the end despite all that, I'd still say it's a good thing that it came into existence, if only for the reason of perhaps driving up more attention for the visual novel and hopefully getting some more people to try that out instead. At least that's the only thing I can think of as anything good the Grisaia anime might bring us in the end, because at least on its own it remains one of the absolute worst adaptations in recent memory. 
And lastly we can only pray that -bit are going to do a slightly better job at adapting the remaining two parts of the Grisaia trilogy (Meikyuu and Rakuen) which have now been confirmed that they're *also* going to be adapted, starting spring ----. In theory this should be a much easier job to pull off since they're significantly shorter in comparison, but I still think we should head into them with the lowest possible expectations this time around, just to be safe. It's the only way to make sure to avoid the never-ending spiral of disappointment that Kajitsu was.

_-*-SPOILER FREE REVIEW-*-_ 
Noragami Aragoto is probably the best -nd season anime this year. There is a big deal of change since the first season, for good. To be honest, the first season's second half was slightly off the entertainment level. I wasn't able to dive into the seriousness of the final arcs in the first season. But I am surprised how second season made a remarkable progress in making the plot more interesting. 
Story: -/-- 
We all have seen Noragami first season and were left with many doubts, mostly related to Yato and Bishamon. In the first half. the second season tackles the back story of Yato and Bishamon and reveals the secrets of Yato, Bishamon, ‎Kazuma, Other Gods etc little by little. The second half deals with the mystery of masked phantoms and also focuses of the relations between Yato, Yukine and Hiyori. Still there are plenty of things which are left untold which we can expect them to be shown in the -rd season, when it comes out. 
Art: --/-- 
Noragami and Noragami Aragoto has been animated by the studio 'Bones' which is very well known for it's remarkable art in the anime 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', 'Soul Eater', 'Space☆Dandy', 'Tokyo Magnitude -.-' etc. As expected of Bones, it's art in Noragami is also smooth, colorful and remarkable. The character designs are another plus point of Noragami series. The characters are drawn so well, I can't even imagine anyone else replacing them in any way. Their designs are the perfect match for their personality which makes them so much likable. 
Sound: --/-- 
Noragami's opening song 'Hey Kids' by 'THE ORAL CIGARETTES' is a BLAST! There's no way anyone can deny me with this point. While everyone may not agree with me, the ending song 'Nirvana' by 'Tia' is another great song and the visuals and the lyrics adds more to it. While Noragami -st season's soundtracks were already good, there has been a great improvement in the soundtracks in the -nd season. The number of soundtracks under different situations have been changed, increased in number, and has become more suited to it than before. The soundtracks played during battles, sad scenes, happy scenes etc. makes them even more interesting and fun to watch. Coming to the voice actors, many famous and insanely talented actors like Kamiya Hiroshi, Kugimiya Rie, Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Hayami Saori, Toyosaki Aki etc. gave an amazing performance which makes Noragami deserve  a --/-- in terms of Sound. 
Character: --/-- 
The male protagonist of the show, Yato, is my most favorite of all the characters. Not just from Noragami, but Yato has become one of my favorite character of all the anime and that's because of his cool attitude, wicked sense of humor and his seriousness when it is needed. Other characters like Bishamon, Kazuma, Yukine are also pretty likeable for their own unique personality. While most of you will disagree with me, I feel that Iki Hiyori is also an important character which adds some spice to the story. Due to her caring and loving nature, she is also pretty likable. And the fact that there is almost zero percent chance of her of being in relationship with a god, Yato, makes us want to know more about their relation progression. 
Enjoyment: --/-- 
For me, the first season of Noragami was like --/-- in terms of enjoyment but the second half was like -/--. With more interesting plot, Noragami Aragoto has exploited the curiosity of the viewers and made this season worth a watch. Definitely --/-- in terms of enjoyment. 
Overall: -.-/-- 
If you really liked Noragami first season, then Noragami Aragoto is undoubtedly a must watch for you! If you are like me who liked half of the season and the other half of the season was meh, then you must give the second season a shot and you will undoubtedly be satisfied with it. And if you didn't like Noragami first season at all, then there's not much helping it, better skip this season. 
I hope my review helped. Comments appreciated. :)

[!!!CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!] 
Hello. This is my first review and I hope you will like it. Btw, I'm sorry if there are mistakes in writing. 
Let's start! :D  
[Main Characters]  
We will start the first of the main characters and their traits. Regu as one of the two main characters I liked him more and more from episode to episode. I like that which is somehow mysterious. He appeared out of nowhere and saved Riko. There are plenty of things about him we do not know but what I do know is that this is a very good friend and a good person, and that makes it higher than ordinary robot. Riko is shown in the anime as a girl who likes to explore areas of the abyss. Also a good person and a great heart. She is the only child of the legendary explorer and white whistles, Lyza. Riko is the type of person who never gives up, even in the most difficult moments and to me a lot like her. Regu and Riko have similar characteristics, such as: courage, perseverance, kindness and ""power of friendship"" :D   
[Story] 
The story begins in the depths of the earth, or in the abyss where Riko is investigating along with his friend named Nat. Already at the beginning, the story becomes more interesting and more interesting. Great bottomless pit, known as the abyss, surrounded by the castle Orth in which lives one of the main characters - Riko. 
Riko is soon rescued by unknown creature in the depths of the abyss after the attack. Riko befriends a young boy but soon learns that he is actually a robot that is likely to come from the bottom of the abyss. Assigns Regu his name and move together in the great adventure that takes them to the bottom of the abyss. 
Unfortunately, the abyss has something called ""Curse of the abyss,"" and this makes it difficult for them to achieve their goal - finding Lyza (Riko's mother) that is in their belief at the bottom of the abyss and is awaiting assistance from the surface. They passed together through a lot of obstacles and meet new friends. They had too few tasks during an appearance at the White whistle Ozen. There they met a young man named Maruruk. After a while, they continued their adventure in order to get to the bottom of the abyss and find white whistle Lyza. They knew about the dangers that may befall them during their journey but with 'strong will and courage, they managed to reach the fourth layer. Riko almost died after being wounded by dangerous creature ""Orb Piercer"" in the fourth layer of the abyss. During Regu's desperate crying, there appears mysterious person Nanachi. Nanachi sinks Regu and Riko in her home where she start with the Riko's treatment. During the healing process, Regu procured the necessary stuffs for healing.  He meets with another household member - Mitty. Regu soon learns the truth about  Nanachi and Mitty, but above all, they become very good friends. Soon, Nanachi asked Regu to do one thing and that is to kill ... Mitty, or that the ""save"" because Mitty was like that because of the ""curse of the abyss"", and shes the long time trapped in this body . Riko after some time be fully recovered by the 'desire to continue his journey with Reg. Despite almost died, Riko's still wanted to get to the bottom of the abyss and find her mother.  
[Art] 
I very much liked how the series has drawn. The pictures are beautiful and relaxing while watching the episode. Some would say that this is like a cartoon for young children because it is a kind of art but do not let that fool you. Of course, like everyone else, I believe that this anime series would be even better if there was a different kind of art, a different view of everything - the characters, nature, creatures and so on. If the characters look a bit 'more realistic', surely this would be a --/-- score. : D It's nice done and I could not find a mistake, however I was not looking for mistakes because I was focused on watching this great anime. ^_^  
[Opening song - OST and sounds] 
Right at the beginning of the opening song, we can see Riko and Reg. I very much liked how everything was beautiful, shown in detail and aligned with the song. Nature of the abyss in opening song is also very nicely displayed with stunning details. Opening song --/--. I'm not given so much attention to the rest of the OST's.. I liked OST ""Hanezeve Caradhina"" despite OST from anime Parasyte ""Next to you"", Hanezeve Caradhina is one of my most favorite songs. If you want to feel any kind of emotions, listen to the OST ""Hanezeve Caradhina"" and enjoy. xD As for the other sounds in the anime is concerned, everything is perfect. 
~ Recommend everyone to see this anime because it is really phenomenal. I trust you enjoyed watching Made in Abyss and you will enjoy watching him. All the best, _Deathbringer. <- ~  Hello from Serbia. :)

It's not terribly controversial to say that newer fans of a medium are more easily impressed than more experienced fans. A trope or twist might look like THE GREATEST THING EVER the first time we see it, but after seeing it more times in different works the novelty starts to wear off and we can judge it more objectively. Eventually we build a far larger pool of references that allow us to get a better sense of where a work truly stands in the context of its genre and medium, and what first appeared to be a flawless masterpiece might not be quite so impressive when judged with more experience. 
All this to say that even though I watched 'Samurai -' when I was new to anime, I still realized it wasn't much good. It seems everyone has a reason to dislike GONZO- this show is mine. 
-Story- 
Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' is a centerpiece of world cinema- THE samurai movie. Then in the US it was adapted into the cowboy film 'The Magnificent Seven' and became one of the indisputable classics of that genre. And so GONZO figured if those baka gaijin could adapt it well, why not they? Well, enough GONZO bashing for now, here's why the plot of 'Samurai -' fell flat on it's face: it's badly convoluted. The first half works well enough, mostly because it sticks somewhat close to Kurosawa's original plot and the post-apocalyptic mecha Sci-Fi setting is a fairly interesting twist. But the second arc goes off past the point where the movie ends into a ridiculous conspiracy involving the bandits, the emperor, a scheming prince, and a whole lot of rice. This is what I call 'Plot Pileup', there's too much going on, none of it is properly explained, and none of it is really engaging or memorable. Less really would have been more here. 
-Art- 
GONZO is essentially a 'Style Over Substance' kind of studio- that can be pretty hit and miss even on the style. The terribly integrated CGI is going to be the one thing you remember from this show if you remember nothing else. The character designs for the main protagonists are fine, but nothing special. However, the low-level bandit mechs looks flat-out stupid. Like something out of a cheap ----'s American sci-fi film. And the animation isn't above going noticeably off-model from time to time. The art isn't completely terrible the same way the plot is, but it's nowhere near good- maybe passable if you squint and remember this show is a decade old. 
-Sound- 
Nothing to see here, move along. It isn't bad, but there's nothing memorable. 
-Character- 
You'll remember Kambei because he's the leader, Kikuchiyo because he's the mecha-samurai, and Kyuzo because his character is the coolest in any version of 'Seven Samurai'. The rest... eh? Goals and motivations for the cast are pretty sparse. They have a quirk or two and a unique special attack, but that's about it. You won't find yourself deeply invested in any of them, or stay up late at night trying to crack the complex inner workings of their minds. The villains are even worse. The bandits are pretty straightforward, but that's forgivable in that they're bandits- they're simple men with simple goals. But the big 'final boss' is a convoluted mess who seems to do whatever the plot needs him to do. You can't even really bother to hate the guy as he's just so bland and his goal is so vague. The original movie cast worked because they were -) interesting characters individually, and -) they subverted nearly every popular samurai trope (most of which were the product of pre-WWII Imperial Japanese propaganda) in a movie that deconstructed the entire samurai genre. The cast here is neither interesting individually, or even functional in the service of some overarching theme (there ISN'T one). 
-Enjoyment- 
I saw the title, remembered how much I liked the movie, and gave it a shot. I liked it well enough at first, but by the end I was watching just to finish and because there wasn't much else available to me in terms of anime at the time. Fans of the original will despise 'Samurai -', and those ignorant of the source material likely won't be terribly impressed either. 
-Overall- 
If you like Japanese culture you need to see Akira Kurosawa's original (in fact I'd recommend for any anime fan to occasionally get outside the 'anime/manga' bubble and sample a wider range of Japanese culture, you'll look more someone cultured and less like a fanboy otaku. Might I suggest some of Eiji Yoshikawa's novels, or a good translation of 'The Tale of the Heike'?). Forget this series. 'Samurai -' isn't really passable on its own merits, but it positively STINKS in comparison to the work which inspired it. It may borrow its name from a classic film, but in terms of quality it has more in common with those cheap 'Magnificent Seven' sequels that were churned out here in the US.

Tl: dr - Watching paint dry the anime. But seriously the paint patterns are mesmerizing.  
The first episode show the two main characters standing next to each other, both blushing furiously and looking away from each other while an awkward silence stretches on between them. I bet you are thinking ""Aww.. cute"" at this point. Burn this image onto your heads because this is the only time you will see something like this... who am I kidding.. You see the same visual each and every episode. The backgrounds, the music and the clothes they wear changes but the single constant in the anime is a visual of Kotarou and Azumi both blushing and decidedly watching somewhere else rather than each other.  
I will agree, the first - times I saw it, I thought it was cute.. Buut when the same thing happens for the ---th time (the number is made up BTW) that warm fuzzy feeling I had inside me was replaced by a burning rage that just wanted to should out ""GET THE FUCKING SHOW STARTED ALREADY"" 
But hey, you know what, its still quite enjoyable, mainly coz there is some growth, painfully slow yea, but its there and the story is delightfully free of unwanted drama and chaos. Story is short, its simple and it doesn't try to complicate shit. No childhood friends, no bitchy rich snob who suddenly falls in love with the protag, no happy go lucky person who just suddenly shows up.. .none of that bullshit. That has to garner it some positive points IMO. Oh and the - mins shorts after the show are hilarious. I have had more fun watching those than the full episode but I digress.  
The music is meh.. as in it exists and thats it.. but they use some j-pop songs during some scenes which actually sounds good. So its good I guess. The artstyle is kinda wierd.. the characters have a strong white outline on them, so they kinda look out of place and the crowd is CGI with wooden animations (prolly running on cinematic -- fps) but hey it doesn't detract from the experience and the  backgrounds are good.  
All in all.. good enough to keep me coming back (though I am more interested in the Miu and Inaba side story tbh) So.. worth a watch I would wager.

This series blew me away. This is how episodic episodes are done right. By the end of the anime, our robotic soldier of an MC could finally become a normal human being. 
Even though there weren't many episodes, they both individually and together pact a lot of depth and weren't wasted filler and even though it was an episodic series the transition between them was flawless, I would forget that I'm not watching a series with giant arcs because those half-hour episodes flowed so smoothly together that each individual episode felt like its own mini-arc in the series.     
What makes the story more interesting is that the focus of the episode isn't Violet but whatever letter or task she has to accomplish for someone else whose life ends up impacting Violets and she ends up gaining new knowledge and understanding about herself and her relationship with the Major.  
Each character plays an important role in her life and helps to progress the story itself and Violet's character development.  
This is a very character driven show and those tend to be my favorite but it certainly doesn't lack action, on the contrary, our MC is a former child soldier and the story takes place both within the memories of the past war and the continued ability to maintain peace with the two former enemy nations. Doesn't help that some rebels want to maintain the conflict and our little MC gets dragged in the middle of it so we get to see her kick some major butt. 
It's also a love story if you can believe it, just a lot more painful, and lacking in the cliches of most romance series that gets overplayed. 
This story is emotionally driven so if you want one with senseless action, I don't think this is the story for you.  
Now in terms of the art and animation, it's probably one of my favorite ones. The colours alone in this series are fantastic. They are filled with such life and personality, that it's blindingly beautiful. The art is largely what interested me in the story and I'm happy that I stuck around to the end. It was worth it.

Lasting the length of a single standard episode, Nyanko Days is cute and fluffy, and gets by entirely on being cute and fluffy. In fact, there's so little substance that it's a struggle to even talk about the show beyond its substance. 
It's not really that it's bad per se. It's mindless and cute stuff to turn your brain off to for about a half-hour, so it's perfectly serviceable in that regards and serves its function in that way. It's also incredibly cute which no one can deny. It's hard to criticize because it effectively serves its function and arguing against that function just feels like it comes off as weird and nitpicky. But one can afford to be nitpicky over a series that is, effectively, nothing. 
When you really get down to it, Nyanko Days is the most anime thing an anime is. Anthropomorphized cats, big eyes and cute faces with characters fitting nicely into archetypes, constant sugary cuteness, loner girl starts to hang out with non-loner girl... it manages to be incredibly exhausting in the very short time it runs, because it feels so much like other similar anime. I don't need originality, but I need something that's derivative with something to offer, and there's nothing here. Not even the cats are cats I can care about. Basically the visual equivalent of ""in one ear and out the other"". 
Part of this is definitely due to the fact that every episode is two minutes long, with only about --% of it being actual content due to a five-second long opening slate and a ---second long ED (approximately). There's almost literally no time to even absorb anything is happening, because everything is so rapid-fire that it washes over incredibly easy. Even multi-part episodes suffer from this. It would have honestly been better to split it up into four-minute episodes, or even eight-minute episodes, because at least then you can realize an episode is happening. Even poor slife-of-life anime get by with so-so paced ---minute episodes; two-minute episodes where a thing happens is beyond the pale. 
It does some things serviceable at least, in a way that doesn't make this anime feel like an actual waste of time. Yuuko Konagai and Azumi Shiratori may not be great characters, but they're done fine enough with at least a bit of interest that it's fine (and also have cute interactions together, more cute than anything else in the show). The, uh, arc with Ran Iketani, the girl who's scared of cats, is amusing while it lasts. The ED should be annoying but it ends up being catchy (I still have it stuck in my head even now) and at least has serviceable visuals for it. Aurally, it has a bouncy and bubbly sound design (but especially when the cats are the focus) that it makes up for the lackluster art. Two of the four cats are distinctive. The anime is so short that even if you find it dreadful, you won't have even spent half-an-hour on it. The voice acting was okay. 
Really it's hard to name what I like about it when there's so little to care about that I have to stretch myself to name positive aspects. But it's enough to not make it a bad anime, just really mediocre. A lot of it comes down to its awful pacing of two-minute episodes, but even if that were fixed, it'd still be really unmemorable and nothing more than a blip in my memory to remember to possibly check out the manga, if I could ever find the time to do so. So it has some benefits, just not many. If you're that into slice-of-life that you need to watch as much as you can from the genre, or have a spare half-hour you can't spend starting/continuing another anime, then you at least have this. Otherwise, there's too little of value to even passingly recommend. But hey, cats.

Story: What can I say about the storyline? It has its up's and downs as well as its ""WTF"" and ""..."". I can already see the creator of School Days trying to portray an image to the viewers that this is typically a normal life of a teenager would lead, but forgetting that not every teenager leads this type of life. Getting deeper into this, I would say the moral of this story goes beyond your ordinary imagination of ecchi and romance. All I can say is, prepare yourself for a story like no other, a story that even sometimes exist in reality and that things like this can happen. From emotions to physical pain, happiness, WTF moments and moments where not even a word can express what this anime is about. It's all for the.. you know what? I'm just going too 'cheat' my way through this review. Haha. 
Art: I'm not one to judge on the art, but sometimes I have a hard time picking out who's who. That is if you are looking specifically at the eyes! The art is on a level that isn't medium, neither low. It's something good enough to get you through the dreading -- episodes. Aside from the ecchi, the art is well drawn for a kid who's taking anime art class! 
Sound: Not much to say about sound, but there is a few songs that were thrown into the anime that caught my attention. I believe because of that, I actually didn't move my hand to the mouse to skip some of the parts that made me angry. 
Character: Okay! Aside from all the whores, sluts and the main character. I gave this score a two for ONE good reason. If you are reading this review before you start watching it, I suggest you keep your focus on Kotonoha Katsura. She is sweet, innocent, shy, new to relationships and very what's that word. Hm, figure it out yourself when you watch it. Katsura, deserve a +- in my case, else wise I would of gave each and every character a - (too bad they don't have -'s). The characters each played a special role and possibly at one point, I felt the same way one of them felt. Trying to relate was something I did with each and every one of the character, sadly. It did not work out. They are all emotional and selfish! Like really now. From what I believe the creator of School Days, took love and just tossed it around like it was a volleyball thus creating a crazy atmosphere of insanely robotic girls wanting to kill and sex the next guy. Haha, do you believe me? 
Enjoyment: PATHETIC. IF YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY THEN THIS IS THE ANIME YOU WANT TO WATCH! Don't miss out on a chance to call each and every character, BAKA!!!!! 
Overall: I want my -- x -- = ?? time back. Thank you, no extra charge.

*SPOILER FREE REVIEW* 
Scrolling through the countless rave reviews, one would assume Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a masterpiece of the --st century. Even without holding high expectations, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a major disappointment. 
Story -/-- 
This anime tried too hard to cram different lengthy ideas into -- episodes, ending up with a disappointing mishmash of ideas. Although the plot relied on the overused ""defying all the odds"" formula, the story was actually decent and interesting. However, the lengthy story meant that there was no way for it to be completed well, let alone add the romance and other arcs. The pacing was increasingly rushed through the first -- episodes, at times abruptly slowing down. The real issue was how at least - episodes of content were forced into the - last episodes. Personally, the worst sign of a rushed anime was shown when the highly anticipated final fight took - minutes to finish. 
Art -/-- 
The art was nice and smooth. The monochromatic palette with streaks of vibrant colours that was used in the finale was exciting and certainly could have been utilised more. The glaring mistake was when they used some crappy CGI rendering to make the -D rock monsters which was a harbinger of a strained budget or laziness. 
Sound -/-- 
The OP and ED was decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack was entirely forgettable. 
Characters -/-- 
Most of the characters felt cookie-cutter and lacked proper character development. The one character (MC) with actual depth had a cliched backstory and was disappointing. To add insult to injury, the romance tag in the genre categorisation was largely undeserved. The contrived relationship between Ikki and Stella was constantly pushed into the viewers' faces, causing me to cringe at the artificial relationship progression. 
Enjoyment -/-- 
Though the action scenes were exciting, the awful pacing made this anime tough to watch at times. 
Overall -/-- 
Had this anime been twice the length, it would actually have been very good. Unfortunately, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry was simply too ambitious. I would not recommend this anime.

Black Lagoon is among the few anime titles released within the last - years I can look back on fondly. While the series on occasion can dip into the ultra fantasy with females appearing to be much stronger than what they should be. I simply cannot ignore the other things that grabs my interest on a high level. One of its main draws for me has been the tonal consistency and mature direction it manages to pull off on occasion. I enjoy its dark humor most of the time, and admire that it doesn't attempt to jam in random and absurd comedic moments simply to ""lighten up the mood"". Many anime titles just annoy me as they attempt to please everyone which leads to severe genre clashing and Black Lagoon just isn't like that. Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail continues to follow that path, and it's the third season of the series that takes place in OVA format and contains episodes -- - --. Although these episodes can stand on their own; I still highly suggest that new viewers pick up from the beginning, because I feel it's necessary to know these characters. 
The main story behind Black Lagoon for those unfamiliar is like this; the series follows the Lagoon Company which is made up of four members: Dutch, Revy, Benny, and Rock. They operate as something like a mercenary group making deliveries and some times work as escorts. They reside in the city of Roanapur, which happens to be about as lawless as a city can get. Rock is clearly a man out of place and spends his time attempting to adjust to his new surroundings and tries to hold on to his ideals, but this becomes tougher as he delves deeper into the world of criminals. This third season also follows Rock's steady decline towards giving in to his negative surroundings. 
The main plot of the story follows Roberta; she was introduced in the first season as a near unstoppable killer whom people compared with the Terminator. She was definitely among the cooler characters as she was just armed to the teeth, and began taking out anyone crazy enough to cross her. This time around the gloves are off and she's more vicious than ever. 
Fans of the first two seasons must be warned that this portion of the series runs a bit differently. The first season did its job in building up the characters and it was more action oriented. The second season did contain quite a bit of action, but it also focused heavily on the series' themes which were introduced in the first season. The latter portion of the second season was more cerebral and used its characters to push things such as existential beliefs, isolation, and consequences for one's actions. This season does the same and it's a bit more dialog heavy, but I enjoyed it a great deal mainly due to the well development of its characters: Rock, Roberta, Garcia, Fabiola, and Revy. They carry the narrative very well through some very engaging and interesting interactions. While the plot does have its pacing issues, there is so much going on to keep more patient viewers gripped. 
The plot follows Roberta as she hunts down Diego's killers whom happens to be an American special forces unit. However, the story is much thicker than that; Roberta's killing of top ranked officials along with bringing her showdown against the U.S. to Roanapur threatens the outlaw lifestyle of the city, which forces the Mafia families to step in against her. There is plenty going on and it all wraps up in an action packed finale. The characters continue to impress in one way or another, as even the American troops whom are painted as bad guys, prove they're far from that title as they display hearts of gold. It's hard to root against them at times, and I found myself conflicted on whether I wanted them to kill Roberta or not. The small war involves plenty of people, and characters from the previous seasons make unexpected appearances. 
It's difficult to point out any real highlight in this season. The action can be spectacular but the characters are every bit attention worthy. The writing is delivered very well, and it's kind of tough watching some of these people try to cling on to ideals in a city that destroys ideals. Roanapur brings out the worst in a lot of people and the writing continues to excel in developing this cesspool of a city. In regards to Rock, this is where it becomes very important to watch at least the second season, because it puts his entire experience in perspective. If there's any issue I have with this season, then perhaps it's small cases with the writing as it marches towards being heavy-handed. There is a lot of dialog on some occasions and there's a feeling that it's just eating up time. 
The production values are solid all around; the animation is gorgeous with its detailed night time backgrounds, lit up towns, and camera work detailing the action. There are no shortcuts in the action here folks. The shootouts are intense, the close range stabbings and chainsaw ripping combat deliver the bloody goods, and there's very little to no overly cheap fan service. I love my anime like this. 
The sound effects are also worth noting and this show should be played loud. The gunfire is cool to hear and this also goes for the rifle silencers; and as usual the soundtrack is rocking which adds to the intensity of the action, and it's used at the right times as well. The voice acting for the English dub is once again wire tight working well for dramatic and hair raising moments alike. The profanity is rolled on thick as usual too. Brad Swaile as Rock stands out again having good chemistry with everyone from the gun toting Revy played by Maryke Hendrikse, to the capoeria fighter Fabiola played by Shannon Chan-Kent. 
Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail is definitely worth an anime fan's time. If you saw the previous seasons then give this a shot as well, but expect something a bit different yet not very much. If you haven't seen any of the series I suggest starting from the beginning.  
Highs: Well developed story line and outstanding visuals 
Lows: More dialog heavy than previous seasons, pacing issues for some

Megalo Box started off as a really cool anime. The most noticeable thing to anyone at first glance is the art, which if I remember correctly was just the art being down-scaled and then up-scaled to give it the aesthetic it has. Don't quote me on that. Either way, the artstyle was interesting and the idea of a --th anniversary project for Ashita no Joe sounded interesting. So why did it end up like it did? There'll be spoilers, btw. 
The first few episodes were great, personally. The soundtrack alongside the art made the first few episodes seem badass and hype, and I was really rooting for Joe to win his goal of...not losing matches I guess? I mean, the main ""story"" doesn't start until a few episodes in, but even by then you're already given several good setups at least. 
-The protagonist, Joe, who is an underdog type character without too much unique to his personality. He's cool and all at least, enough to get you rooting for him if nothing else. Plus he rides a motorcycle - or - times. 
- An antagonist, Yuri, who doesn't actually seem like a generic douchebag but an actual person who respects the sport and the fighters, and is rather likable as far as antagonists go, even by the end. 
-An idea of what exactly Megalo-boxing is and on what scale of appeal the sport is. 
It's enough of a setup within the first few episodes to give a sports anime a nice start, a promising start. I sure thought so, at least. 
The show was pretty good up until the main story started, whatever episode that was. I don't think I'm in the minority opinion for that statement seeing as how the MAL score around that time started slowly going down from a mid--.- to what it is now. The problem that starts around this time is the problem that the show inevitably ends with: predictability. 
Being a sports anime, you're kind of expected from the get-go to assume the protagonist will win a lot of the time and be all badass and stuff. But Megalo Box doesn't even try to be subtle about it. Every match is the same thing over and over again. You're given an ""antagonist"" for that match who gets some semi-interesting backstory and maybe some relevancy to other characters, and then they get in the ring with Joe and they both have at each other. Joe gets the absolute crap beat out of him for several minutes, while Sachiko (an annoying and ---% useless kid who does a really cringey rap in one of the last few episodes) and Nanbu (a generic coach) yell at him to do this and that and not give up. Then, through the power of absolutely nothing, Joe is able to K.O. the opponent in one hit, ending the match with a win for him. I never mentioned this, but Joe is ""gearless"" during all of these fights meaning that basically he doesn't have these boxing-aid-machines on his arms. Logically, he should lose all his battles against his opponents who DO all have gear, since they literally have machines on their arms whereas Joe has his arms bare, however, he never loses. This means that Joe is literally the most overpowered character in this show, because not once does he get KO'd even though by all means he should, especially when you see how badly his ass gets beat in the ring. Each match starts and ends the same way, with a lot of flashbacks and other things going on being thrown into the fray WHILE the matches are going on, which often times messes with the momentum of the fights. Most of that stuff could've been mentioned before the fights at least, then I'd at least go into each fight with a good understanding of the opponent, regardless of how generic their backstory is. 
That doesn't happen, of course. The fights are pretty cool though, and well choreographed imo. 
Asides from the matches being done in such a bad way (asides from the actual fighting, for the most part), the main story is also really lame. A woman, who also could be considered an antagonist of sorts, is basically the founder of megalo-boxing as we see it and hosts the competition for which everything takes place. I think what her goal was was to show-off how interesting megalo-boxing was and how viable it is as a military weapon. At least, that's what I could remember from the ending. Frankly, whenever the fights weren't happening I found myself bored a lot of the time, which is another point to bring up. Sure the music's good and the art is unique, but the characters either have no depth or are straight-up bad. Why should I care about the story anyways? I already know Joe is going to win all the matches just because he can, why not just skip to the fights? I mean, they show the meat of who the opponents Joe face are mid-fighting, so it's not like I have to spend the other -- minutes getting to know who they are and whatever the hell else is going on. The only character I can say was genuinely interesting was Yuri, although he reminds me too much of the one character from Ping Pong to say he's original. On the other hand, there's some story going on with Nanbu and some loanshark type guy who's just an asshole but is also kind of cool. Nanbu has to have Joe win the Megalo Box tournament at first so that the mean man can make money, then he has to lose it so the mean man can make money. It's probably the most interesting thing going on story-wise but that isn't saying a whole lot. 
So all-in-all, you've got a run-of-the-mill nothing story, several obnoxious/shallow/boring characters, and fights that are as predictable as they come. Frankly, I can't say there's much reason to watch this show asides from the artstyle and soundtrack. If you strip those two things away this show has nothing else going for it really. That's not to say you SHOULDN'T watch it, that's your choice obviously and there's some pretty cool stuff that happens in the show every so often, but there's nothing to gain from watching it. No messages besides generic underdog stuff and blah blah blah watch Rocky instead if you want something more interesting that's also boxing related (can't comment on Ippo or Ashita no Joe, so). Frankly this show is just disappointing and has nothing worthwhile in any of the major departments. Can't really recommend it for anyone who wants a sports anime with substance as I can with, say, Ping Pong. Give that a watch instead, there's a good chance it'll be more of an experience than this show would be.

Story: 
Based around a character that wants to become an idol I really didn't expect much from this series. Starting out with that prejudice I was surprised to see new approaches in this business and was instantly drawn by this anime. Unlike other storys full of clich&eacute;d stuff, our protagonist (Kyoko) isn't driven by the wish of fame, money or power as it is common. No, all she wants is revenge on her former ... well ... &quot;boyfriend&quot;... kind of... not.  
With this the anime's story thrives very much from character developement and I mean REAL character developement. Additionally it is well rounded up with a lot of good comedic events.  
But in the end it turns into an all to common basic plot: the protagonist has to overcome obstacles with hard work, just with a nice twist. Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a solid story, just not an all to originally one. Still the added surprising elements are what makes this very good. 
- points for a story with a relly nice change 
Character: 
With Kyoko, for once, we have a female lead that is independent and isn't waiting for a prince in shining armor to save her. It's pretty much the opposite, since she is already disappointed of her prince, that took her out into the big town so she could do his chores... actually that's not quite right... she came to hate the prince and wants revenge for using and playing her. 
Having that said, Kyoko is a rather fresh and surprising character. With her hate and her own spirits fighting each other we see a lot of her inner conflict of trying to become loved by the public and at the same time being full of hate for Shotaro. We can expect a lot more character developement. 
The other two male characters influencing Kyoko's new life certainly seem interesting as well.  
Shotaro is pretty much the guy who thinks too highly of himself and is for now the perfect guy for Kyoko's hate manifestation, but then there are times where it seems like all that Kyoko want is to be acknowledged by him. 
Ren on the other hand is a perfectionist, who takes his job seriously and expects others to do so as well. Since Kyoko is want to be an idol only out of revenge he certainly has a little problem with her. But judging him now wouldn't be right, since there wasn't much screentime focused on him up till now. 
- points for Characters Development to look forward too 
Sound: 
The background music/sound often go by unnoticed, which actually might be a good thing. That is not because the music is bad, but rather because this way the watcher can focus a lot more on the story. Which in turn means it's simply not necessary to pep up the story with catchy music, because it can stand on it's own. But you gotta admit the music isn't too impressive either. 
I won't rate the opening and ending, since that often depends on personal flavor. (okay... I do prefer the ending song ^_^) 
- points for a well used and solid music 
Art: 
The art quality certainly is a very good one. Definetly above todays average. The characters are overall very well drawn, and the backgrounds are always fitting the context perfectly.  
Sadly animation quality is at very few points not at it's peak, but even then still a good one. Also sometimes the background seems a bit empty, but that's not to big of a deal since it's usually enough to carry the athmosphere. 
- points for nice work from the graphics department 
Enjoyment: 
The story just makes me want to cheer Kyoko on. Damn, this girls deserves her revenge. *waves a Kyoko flag with waterfall eyes and starts shouting &quot;KYOKO! KYOKO!&quot;* 
It's not only the really interesting story, but also all the little bits which make laugh that make this anime such a great show. 
This anime goes even with a perfectly balanced pace, blended out of story advancement and humour. 
-- points for Kyoko and all the hilarious moments 
I for myself find me really enchanted to Kyoko and this anime. So give it a try as well. ;)

Dragon Maid is a yuri slice of life anime with some...interesting...undertones. I'm going to review this by Story, Art, Sound, Characters, and Enjoyment, like the official review scorer.  
[SWEARING AND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD] 
Story: -/-- It's a great concept if a bit cliche, a magical being comes to the human and doesn't understand shit, the human is stoic and peeved, the magic being is all smiles, and there's a host of weirdos that come along for the ride. It's very good at first, with excellent comedy and touching moments with the title characters, Kobayashi and Tohru the Dragon Maid. Kanna is just generally adorable, and it feels very sweet and nice. Then the middle of the series rolls around and everything goes to absolute shit. This includes meaningless characters, idiotic repetitive jokes, and pedophilic undertones. Actually undertones is a bad way of describing it, as a fucking second grader has an ahegao orgasm every three seconds, a dragon with watermelons for breasts smothers a child with them repeatedly, and at one point Kanna nearly goes full on R. Kelly on ahegao girl. Thankfully it improves by episode -, which was my favorite episode and single-handedly raised this anime's score from a - to a -. the rest of the show is decent, though the last episode is a bit cheesy. 
Art: -/-- Nice art, simple in design and very colorful. I loved the fight scene animation and I wish there had been more. It was fluid, smooth, and very warm and cheery. The character design was good except for a certain ex-goddess of fertility. 
Sound: -/-- I loved the Dragon Maid OP, I even added it to my master playlist. It's very happy and fun to listen to, and I never skip it as it is quite frankly the best part of the entire show. The ending is good too, though I frequently skipped it. The actual anime audio is good, the sound effects are on point, although the amount of noises Lucoa's breasts make when they jiggle is a bit excessive. As for the English voice acting (I watched the dub) it's good overall, if pretty typical. Kobayashi is very entertaining to listen to when drunk, but Takiya's otaku voice is grating and annoyed me. The other characters have pretty typical voices and I can't fault them.  
Character: -/-- Oh boy, this category is a doozy. Every character in this anime has quality varying from good to downright awful. Let's start with the best. Kobayashi, Tohru, and Fafnir all are entertaining, sweet, and likable. Kobayashi's stoic attitude is a nice contrast to Tohru's cheery ignorance and Fafnir's comical emo hatred is funny and a nice way to balance out the cast. On to the ""ok"" characters. Elma is not altogether bad, but very underdeveloped, as her late introduction gives her a very one-dimensional personality with a somewhat exasperating indecisiveness. Takiya is an alright character, and his dual personality from normal office worker to Fafnir's crazed otaku roomie is comical but grating. Shota is also alright, though I was too busy pitying his poor slot in life to really analyze his character. Now here's the selection of characters that killed this anime for me: Kanna, Riko, and *shudder* Lucoa. All of these characters are awful, and each for similar reasons. You might be saying, ""sPEtZ kaNnA iS ABsOluTeLY pERfeCt kILL yoURseLf"" but let me explain. Kanna is indeed adorable, precious, and God's gift to humanity. Thing is, she also attempted to rape a child. Kanna is ---+ years old, and literally forces Riko onto the ground and says she's gonna go ""Dragon Style"". What. The. Fuck. This was a major turn-off to me as this kind of thing is unacceptable. So that's why I kind of hate Kanna. Riko is up next and her character is pretty simple. She's absolutely infatuated with Kanna in a clearly sexual way despite being a second grader. Whenever Kanna brushes by her she has a goddamn ahegao orgasm. A fucking second grader. Orgasming. Some of you may find this cute but for me that's really fucking creepy. Now, onto the bitch that literally brought this anime's quality down from a - to a -. (episode - and the OP brought it up to a -.) Lucoa is an awful character, not because she's designed for fan service but rather for the fact of how she does it. Her breasts aren't large, they're disproportionately massive, to the point of looking like tumorous watermelons growing off her chest. What does she do with these absolute units of tits you ask? She rubs the face of a nine year old boy with them. Dis-fucking-scusting. She also refuses to look modest, to the point of disgust rather than being turned on. She repeatedly antagonizes Shota with them to the point he thinks she's a succubus. She often acts pedophilic towards him but no one cares, because ""hey! It's a chick!"" despite the unnerving similarity to Boku No Pico at some points. Also, after analyzing the character, personality, and mythological factors it's safe to assume that Lucoa may be a male dragon. Did anyone else just see Jared from Subway flicker in front of them like Slenderman, or is it just me? Either way it made this character meaningless and intolerable. All in all, the characters are the worst part of this anime and if a good amount were dropped it could have brought this anime to an - or even -.  
Enjoyment: -/-- This anime has a fantastic OP, an interesting story, and some likable characters. The art is clean, the audio is good, and Fafnir is hilarious. However, the inclusion of excessive fan service, maid fetishes, lolicon influence, and pedophilic undertones brought this anime down exponentially, and it's a sorry shame that this couldn't have been better. Fuck you Lucoa.  
In conclusion, Dragon Maid is a failure of an anime that could have gone far. Don't buy into the hype, this anime is only worth watching if you like feeling like a pervert after completion. I would love to see a rewrite of this concept with a higher focus on the ignorance comedy and quasi-dimensional battle concept. However it is instead a pulpy creepfest that left me feeling uncomfortable. And that's my whole review of Dragon Maid, thanks for reading if you got this far!

(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!) 
For the first season of Concrete Revolutio, I talked about Superman and how lame of a hero he is. I even went so far as to say that the (and I quote myself) “kryptonite will not be taking down Concrete anytime soon.” 
Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou – The Last Song proved me wrong – and not about Superman. 
STORY 
Last Song resumes roughly where the first season left off. “Roughly” because the ordering of events is still purposely jumbled. Regardless, Jiro, Kikko, and the Superhuman Bureau are doing their best to fight for justice – in whatever way they know how. 
When looking back on the first season, it impressed with its setup. The complex themes on morality, race, and control. The different arcs for each of its characters. This premise in general. It stood as a very strong, very interesting anime, proving that the “super” in “superhuman” applied to itself, too. 
Unfortunately, Last Song forgets about that prefix. 
Before getting into why this second season goes loses, it’s worth pointing out what it does right. 
Once again, its main theme on justice – and its ties to those more nuanced ideas like morals and racism and control – are in full force. One episode focuses on how, despite all the justice and good and sacrifices of centuries past, the current wars and fighting made it worthless. Another episode focuses on losing a loved one and what that drives people to do. A different one focuses on a superhuman soldier with PTSD who does not (cannot) ever get the justice he deserves. 
The different callbacks are also nice. Seeing Campe emerge from her chrysalis to resolve Human-man’s conflict or watching as the immortal family sneak away are tiny references to earlier material. But their inclusion can give added weight or tie-ins to the events at hand – sometimes both. 
And some cool moments exist throughout its run. Learning that Jiro actually killed Rainbow Knight (by accident) and that a possible parallel world (this world) exists give the narrative some legs to run with. 
So, what goes wrong? 
The best way to understand second season’s missteps is by comparing it to its prequel. The first season had the benefit of being, well, a first season. All it realistically had to do was set everything up so that, when it passed the story baton, it did so with gusto and grace. Which it did. 
More than this, though, the first season had a goal. It may not have seemed that way, what with the nonchronological plotline and the episodic material, but it clearly wanted to get somewhere: Jiro’s defection from the Superhuman Bureau. 
The second season does not have the luxury of setting up; it must carry that baton to the finish line. Meaning, what’s left is its goal which it must reach. And that’s the problem: It has no goal. 
Another way to put it is that Last Song is aimless. The show never makes it clear what it wants to do, and, as a result, this season feels like it either isn’t going anywhere or is going nowhere. 
For instance, the show once again chooses an episodic format to showcase its ideas. In the first three episodes, it features (separately) a space cowboy, an ex-band-member-turned-giant, and a forest goddess. Some pretty interesting material. But, already, the anime isn’t making it clear where it wants to go. 
Yet, for some reason, the anime carries this mindset for the next four episodes. So, for the first seven episodes of this eleven-episode season, it’s just one singular set of events after another. Sure, there are minute consequences that exist between them (mostly due to the jumbled ordering), but that end goal is nowhere in sight. 
These episodes themselves also introduce a new problem. One of the driving forces is how split everybody is. The Superhuman Bureau versus the ad people versus the police versus Jiro. Sadly, a lot of the conflicts boil down to let’s-not-help-Jiro-but-actually-let’s-help-him scenarios. Not so much cat and mouse but guy-with-a-pet-mouse-that-misbehaves and mouse. It leads to repetition and a huge waste of potential as these separate sides never seem to fully clash. 
With only four episodes left, Last Song realizes it needs that to happen, and so it finally has a goal to run to. But it’s already too late. For while the pacing in the first two-thirds is rather slow, the pacing in this last one-third is way too fast, leading to a heap of writing troubles. 
Jiro’s all-important past is revealed by a magic helmet through a dream sequence. 
Master Ultima’s death comes out of nowhere after he hasn’t been around for ages. 
The reveal of the main nemesis being like Jiro in origin comes off as quite convenient. 
Smaller details also add up. Jaguar saying out loud Jiro’s own words about Fuurouta reminding him of justice came off as sloppy. Fuurouta revealing to Kikko the secret about her contained demon powers, meant as more of a joke, ends up as a convenient and inconsequential remark. 
Even something like the show toning down the nonchronological format hurts it. The jumbled contents made it more interesting due to the back-and-forth nature. This format also supported its convoluted themes. In this sequel, it understandably must (more or less) stay in the near-present. But that inherently reduces its intrigue levels. 
The show’s final note (relevant word here) reveals why the sequel is named so. Like a song sung and heard everywhere, passed on from generation to generation, superhumans will live on. Heeding the call of those who need help. While the song metaphor feels a bit tacked on, it’s a nice message that ties to salvage what was left of this sprained story. 
ANIMATION 
Not too much else to say differently about Last Song’s art and animation this time around. A small step down but nothing obtuse. 
The character designs don’t flip-flop as often since the past isn’t depicted to the same extent as before, but what is given is still strong. Kikko’s longer hair and bigger bust make it easy to spot how much she has grown up. Koma’s cloak, multi-color eyes, and cat ears prove that the show still knows how to come up with an interesting (and cute) look. And Jaguar’s later new getup retains his original self while outwardly declaring his “betrayal.” 
Despite reducing the comic-book braille flourish, artistic techniques persist. A wide color palette, shadowing, and the comedic reactions help to spice up the visuals once more. 
As for actual animation, it does seem to falter somewhat. It’s not too noticeable throughout the run, but some scenes are subpar, like the ski jump. Plus, there are not as many major fights, and everyone likes to do a bit more talking and standing around than usual. 
Still, the anime can argue otherwise: Raito gets an impressive scene again, Kikko uses her magic all the time, and the final battle has its fair share of fire, explosions, and duels. 
CHARACTERS 
Last Song commits its biggest blunder with its cast. 
It’s such a surprising statement to make because the show set them all up so well. Kikko’s unrequited love and the maturity she would need to gain. Emi’s mysterious background. Fuurouta’s role as mediator for everyone. Jaguar’s time-travel and time-stopping abilities. Magotake and his relationship with his son Jiro. Raito’s descent from police detective to superhuman enforcer. 
Except for Jiro, however, the anime mishandles that baton even more. 
Kikko is the oddest. She essentially becomes a non-character, showing up to each scene and saying little more than “Meteortail!” A lot. Where she once had a purpose – as Jiro’s potential love interest and as a meaningful character to the story at large – the anime treats her as little more than an extra. 
The anime does try, though. Ullr (her tiny companion) mentions in an offhand remark that Kikko no longer has a claim as queen due to her feelings and loss of her powers. But it’s literally a one-time bit of information, so its impact is minimal. 
The best it could do was a small moment in episode five. Kikko chats with Jiro. About her thoughts on the different feuding factions and their own conflict. While she understands all that, she outright says she stays in the Superhuman Bureau just so she can see Jiro more. Which is great. It’s a warped mindset, but her devout feelings make her more interesting. 
Unfortunately, thanks to Jiro’s promise to stay away from her, and the anime refusing to nurture her relationships with the others more, Last Song wastes this moment completely. 
Emi goes through something similar. The anime (from last season) already refrained from revealing much about her. In this season, it does so again. Big mistake. It makes her pleas near the end, her “romantic” connection to Jiro, both moot and missing emotion. 
The audience gets a little bit in the form of some flashbacks, but it is so miniscule that it may as well have never existed to begin with. 
Fuurouta, later on, runs the bar that welcomes all superhumans. But, for most of the second season, he does not contribute much beyond changing into his different animals and forms when needed. 
Magotake, like Kikko, barely interacts with Jiro, leaving the link between “father” and “son” missing many a chain. 
Even Jaguar has troubles. Last Song makes him relevant only right at the end when he messes with time. Before the last episode (and realistically the last ten minutes), he does almost nothing important or interesting. Again, that’s the show’s fault. His time-controlling pocket-watch was stolen from him at some point, so his relevance, like Kikko’s, goes down the drain. 
Raito, at the very least, has his fall depicted. Yet he, too, barely impacts the show, challenging neither Jiro nor the others to any noticeable extent. 
All these characters follow a similar trend: not receiving attention. Last Song, rather than expounding on its cast, chose instead to focus on the mini-arc dealings and the characters therein. In other words, the show is plot driven (again). But, since that failed, its characters fail even harder. 
Arguably, the only character that can even be considered worthwhile is Jiro. As he tries to uphold his ideals on justice, helping superhumans here and there regardless of them being “good” or “bad,” he slowly figures out that his methods are not helping as much as he would like. 
Throughout each episode, he either pushes back against the Superhuman Bureau or does his best to aid those in need. While he tends to be a broken record like Kikko and the others, his words are at least meaningful. Questioning his own sense of justice, declaring the ambiguity of “right” and “wrong,” and trying to understand their messed-up world gives him strength as a character since he actually receives attention from the show in the form of thematic exploration. 
Simultaneously, the audience comes to know more about Jiro’s past. How he came to tame the beast within and his origin story of sorts. It’s not a lot, but, compared to everyone else this season, it’s a welcome sight. 
His “betrayal” at the end is a cool idea due to its full-circle feeling in relation to Rainbow Knight. Furthermore, his proclamation that he is superhuman, and not a beast, reflects how much he has grown through his experiences. 
Granted, the whole “superhumans have an evil being paired with them” idea is odd since it never felt like the main focus of the show. Still, its implication – that his statement applies to people as well – gives it more ground. At the minimum, his death, which instills hope for those in the future, ends his character on a poetic (albeit unsatisfactory) note. 
Altogether, Jiro is the only one who even tried to complete the race. 
SOUND 
Like with the art and the animation, not too much else can be said that hasn’t already about the sound that Last Song employs. 
Especially in regards to the original soundtrack and the voice-acting performances. Once again, they perform their job without doing anything exceptional. The OST’s guitar and techno choices fit with the melancholic and chaotic events, and the VA’s do not have any stand-out moments as they reprise their roles. 
Except perhaps Kaito Ishikawa as Jiro. Again, nothing noteworthy, but his emotional voice, screams, and cries did not go unnoticed. 
That leaves the opening track and the ending track. 
The OP starts off fevered, then glides into a more reserved state. Then it lets loose, the vocalist and the beat picking up intensity with the dubstep quick to follow. The speed and the catchiness in the second half further support the piece. It takes a couple of listens, but, afterwards, it stands as a solid track. 
The ED is not just the best part of the music but also the best part of all of Last Song. The guitar and the drums jam well together, but it’s the vocalist’s syllabic singing and the foot-tapping beat that make it a cool track. Plus, that sense of structure fits well with the theme of control that permeates the show. 
ENJOYMENT 
I rated the first season of this series rather highly because it set itself up for greatness. If nothing else, it created something thoughtful and interesting. 
The second season doesn’t have that. The characters were already not that memorable, but, coupled with them hardly receiving any focus this time around, it makes them a wash. The narrative devolves into a too-episodic chore that isn’t enthralling no matter how many giant robots are included. The romance angle ends up unused and lame. 
To me, the most interesting episode was episode four: “Devila and Devilo.” More specifically, the final sequence was one that made me think. 
Devilo is known for using mundane wording to persuade his audience. So, when he starts to ramble about life and beauty and the universe, it made me question whether his words were true or if they just rang hollow. Not just through some clever meta game the show was playing but for myself as well. 
Other than that, though, the anime didn’t give me much else – besides disappointment. 
Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou – The Last Song concludes in a less-than-ideal state. The aimless story, the lack of character exploration, and the slight downgrade in visuals suppress the anime’s larger idea on justice and the rocking ED. Simply put, this season becomes the series’ own kryptonite. 
SUMMARY 
Story: Fine, strong themes once more on justice, morality, and race, but the episodic format and the awkward writing choices leave it lagging 
Animation: Good, nice character designs, varied artistic direction, and okay actual animation 
Characters: Bad, all except Jiro receive very little attention, leading to their low impact and even lower worthwhileness 
Sound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances 
Enjoyment: Bad, a disappointing second half to say the least 
Final Score: -/--

Welcome to the NHK is quit different from your usual slice of life anime...in this case it pull from actual real life situations. You have the protagonist Tatsuhiro Satou, who is a hikiamori (a condition of, some kind, that prevent the person from wanting to leave the house-a shut in, if you will). He attributes his condition the the NHK, an organization that plans to turn the world into shut-in otakus using catchy music and moe anime to do so. 
He soon meets Misaki Nakahara, a girl who wishes to change Satou for the best. From this point on, he encounters many obstetrical and situations that lead to his recovery or pend on his destruction of normal life. Conspiracy? 
The story is very strong and driven by the emotions of the characters themselves. Each major character is given back story as to why they are like what they are now. In the midst of all of this they progress into situations based on the pasts (It is all pretty down to earth, if I might add). The story, being a slice of life, also includes comedy. Although it is very dark comedy. 
The over all art and sound had nothing eye or ear catching, although nothing bad or lack their of either (aside from Puruin). 
Overall this story is very enjoyable, but not recommended for a younger audience. The story is best driven by the characters and down to earth setting of the story. Although no real art or sound excellencys in the anime.

Little Witch Academia is a standout anime, even though so far there is only one part and it is about -- minutes long at this stage I would definitely consider this a masterpiece. 
Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if an anime is worth watching you usually don't want to read all that much. 
Positives 
- A short story which leaves room for expansion yet ties up the major loose ends and sticks to a three act structure incredibly well. 
- The characters are all very different from each other, none are stereotypical archetypes and each are likeable in their own way. 
- The soundtrack is not something I noticed too much, but it was enough to create the correct atmosphere for the scenario's. 
- The animation, I feel like this really needs to be stressed, by god the animation is amazing, everything is so smooth I think this might be the smoothest and most consistent animation i've ever seen. 
Negatives 
- Hard to think of many. 
- The soundtrack wasn't extremely memorable, hardly much of a negative. 
Like I said, it's very difficult for me personally to find faults in Little Witch Academia, I would recommend this to almost anyone and am certainly looking forward to the future of this project.

I didn't expect that this will turn out to be so good. 
After watching this i was like This is something you don't expect very often, A simple lovable movie with a strong yet simple plot. 
if you are reading, Go WATCH IT  [ you will be glad you did ]  
I haven't read the manga or any other material but after watching this I now want to read all their is about this series. 
This is one of those anime that will make you glad you watched them, but as always i wasn't satisfied with the ending. It has a superb ending no doubt about it but i can't see or it's like i don't want to see people separated in the end even if in the ending they made the right decision as always in most of the cases. 
The story or rather the theory of time travel was rather week. You can't expect Time Travel genre to be as accurate as Steins;Gate, but that aside their is one another problem in the plot a minor one, but it is easily to look that aside in the way the story unfolds. 
<<  If you want to enjoy your -:-- hr of your life GO for it. >> 
-------} Spoiler Ahead {------ 
The reason for the time travel seems to be trivial, i am not talking about the AirHead girl, i am talking about him the reason to time travel just to watch a painting was the INTERNET was destroyed at his time or what? 
And the other thing i noticed that people other than the time traveler can notice time traveler disappeared. Even if we apply the whole Deja-vu theory of Steins;Gate than also how did that guy noticed that she was time leaping? 
And the way he talked about the future it looked like an post-WW- scenario and if they have Time travel Tech. then why the hell return for a stupid painting why not stop the WW-? 
If by any miracle you are reading this than if you are wondering if i am a Steins;Gate maniac the yes i am a steins;gate maniac and a physics maniac too. 
{------||{ End Of Spoiler }=<+>---==]]} 
But keeping the my personal question aside it was a Good Story. 
Perhaps what keep me captivated to this story all the time was how it keeps your interest bounded.

Look. At the start of this movie, we are three episodes into this series and the only constants have been bad animation, raising a million questions per film, and not answering any questions. At the very least, the movies before this one had positives like decent character development and some OK action. This movie doesn't. Instead, it doubled down on all those bad aspects. 
Animation: The *vast majority* of the movie is static shots or one character moving a little bit per cut. This is not film caliber animation. It's barely TV quality. There is a scene at the end where they have like five minutes of b roll digivolutions just to show us a -- second fight in which none of the Ultimate forms are even spotlighted properly. 
Raising Questions: This a fourth movie and they are still introducing us to brand new characters like Hackmon and introducing brand new backstory like Hanekawa's Digimon. And the fact that the Gennai we've seen isn't even the same Gennai from the series. None of this makes sense or has built naturally from previous movies. It's all meaningless if all of this is shown to us without explanations or even reasons why these facts matter. 
Not Answering Questions: The *third* movie finally gave us *some* insight into what the overall plot of this series was going to be about. The DigiDestined going to the Digital World to find their Digimon and stop the cause of the Infected Digimon. The Infected Digimon are never mentioned. They find their Digimon immediately. On top of that, none of the new material was properly explained, either. On top of *that*, not much at all happens. They don't even leave the beach and decide what to do for more than the first fourth. On top of THAT, the movie ends IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCENE. There is no sense of purpose or conclusiveness to any of this. 
This is the fourth movie in a series. If they couldn't turn those problems around here, they are never going to be able to turn this around. And they didn't. Not only have they produced the worst Digimon tri movie yet, they have produced an insult to all of us who have stuck with the series in spite of its problems.

I read the reviews for this anime, and thought it would be great... I was wrong. I'm not a fan of the harem anime's from the start, and I didn't originally think this would be like that.  
Honestly it's best redeeming quality is the opening theme... 
It's supposed to be funny, but I find it hard to watch due to the fact that basically every episode consists of yelling and screaming. And really, the whole trying-to-kill-Nagasumi thing gets old REALLY fast. A lot of things happen, but I haven't laughed at all, because it's more annoying than funny.  
The story is hidden in the background of the attempted humour, and isn't all that great, either.  
The character are alright, but none of them stand out as unique. Nagasumi is no different from guys in other harem animes, and none of the characters are fresh.  
The art and sound of the anime are the only things I enjoyed. I really wanted to get into it, but EVERY episode is the same. I'm not even finished the series yet, but I'm not sure I'll even be able to.  
They could have made this story really funny, and there is potential for it, but they fail.

Little Busters! 
If you're like me and you're thinking about watching this because the visual novel was made by Key, don't. Watch it with an independent mindset, free of Clannad, Kanon, etc. If you don't you're just gonna find disappointment. 
Story: -/-- 
The story was definitely not as good as Key's previous works. Yes, it followed the general plot of a high school boy helping multiple girls cope and effectively saving their lives in one way or the other, but it simply was not as engaging. There were many story elements that  could have been left out. For example, Riki's narcolepsy. So what? It did not influence the progression of the story whatsoever. There was also no romantic interest, but the friendships gained throughout the series filled in the hole nicely for those who don't mind the absence of romance.  
Art: --/-- 
As expected, it was beautifully animated. No complaints.  
Sound: -/-- 
The music lacked variety. There was probably one tune that played in every emotional scene throughout the show. Variety is always good when the anime is only about friendship and nothing else is going on. Otherwise the show becomes drab very quickly. Also, the female voices were THE MOST annoying I have ever heard. I was relieved when Kurugaya would speak as she was the only normal sounding female voice in the series. This anime is not for people who detest whimpering, crybaby voice work that sounds like Asian porn. 
Character: -/-- 
The characters were good with each having his/her own unique personalities. Each fought their own battles, emerging as victorious, developed characters. They were funny when they were supposed to be, and emotional when it was expected. However, I could not get around how they acted like - year olds throughout the whole show. If the producers were aiming for a moe approach, they definitely failed. I saw nothing cute in these characters at all. Maybe it's because i'm not into that stuff. But panty shots of bears and ducks on teenage girls aren't really my thing. I found it awkward and completely unnecessary to the story. 
Enjoyment/Overall -/-- 
It was definitely not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. Towards the middle of the season, I was struggling to keep watching. I have a policy to watch an anime all the way through once I reach a certain point, so there was no going back. The story was boring and the characters were annoying. As usual, Key was aiming for an emotional tale that would grip our hearts and make us feel the pain the characters felt but this simply was not the case this time. It was just, meh. I would recommend this like I would recommend SAO: I wouldn't. Unless you like mediocre anime that relies solely on fan service to get viewers.  
So if you just finished Clannad and want to watch another one of Key's visual novels animated, do yourself a favor and skip this one and watch Angel Beats or something instead.  
There is a second season titled ""Little Busters: Refrain"" and i'm going to be watching it when it airs toward the end of ----.  Who knows? Maybe it will pull an ""Afterstory"" on us and crush our hearts to bits before an amazing ending. Hopefully it isn't as painful to watch as Season - was.

This is an anime that is tailored for a very specific taste. It's also good to mention in the beginning that there may be -- episodes, but it's really more close to -- because each episode has about -- minutes to it rather than the usual -- that anime has.  
TL:DR is at the very ending without spoilers, but the overall review might contain some.  
Story: - 
The actual story is really complicated, and I had to look up some of the questions I had. The first reaction you might get after completing it would probably be, ""WTF??"" because it leaves you feeling really empty. But taking a moment to digest everything, the story was really well written. 
At first you watch it as a comedy until the last few episodes which turn dark really quick, not that the show didn't indicate it's a dark show in the beginning. When Shichika casually mentions that he kills his father, but never really addresses it, it serves at a good indicator that despite the art and dry humor, this is a pretty messed up story. It reminded me a bit like Panties and Stockings where the art and humor seemed light but was very --+ for various of reasons.  
The story unravels itself much similar as a puzzle, not really getting the full picture until you have reached the end and take a step back. It holds the idea of legacy as well as how the future cannot be changed. I would also argue that it is a coming of age (not really?? since Shichika is already grown in body but not really in mind), and how Shichika develops himself as a person paving his own fate in the end, not accepting his position as a sword.  
There are many other points the story tells that is embedded within the series, but at the same time, I wouldn't say it was perfect story telling. There were many plot holes in terms of specific characters, but as an overarching story, it did well. As specific episodes, I would say only the last few hold any significance. Despite the fact it was overly complicated in my opinion, the concepts it held and told made me give high marks for it.  
Art: - 
The art was what actually drew me to this series. It was really unusual for an anime to have such a distinct style such as this. The character designs physically all fit to my personal aesthetic taste that I really enjoyed. The cartoonish? style as well as how the colors matched with everything especially with the characters ( such as the color scheme of the Maniwani's and Shichika's sister etc.) really came together nicely. Nothing felt overwhelmingly too colorful, despite the very vibrant colors of the entire series. The themes they had set for each character also in term of looks were great, giving distinct characteristics that allowed you to distinguish everyone. Same face syndrome (Love Idol???? *cough cough*) was not there despite the simplicity of the art style itself.  
I just really liked the color palette and art my dude.  
Sound: -- 
Wow wow. I have not enjoyed a soundtrack like this since, I don't know, Princess Kaguya? It mixes between traditional japanese sounds, but often puts this hip pop? in the background which.... oddly fits really well. It fit so well I couldn't help but to admire it and try to hear it when they were sometimes talking.  
It threw me off at first because that was not what I was expecting as well as not the usual anime soundtrack which I was use to. But while watching the series, it flowed so well in a sense that the mood of the sound did not seem forceful on the situation. Sometimes, when you get series moods or action scenes, which places this dramatic moment, indicating that it is a dramatic moment.  
It's useful and can even be iconic (My Hero Academia, ya'll know that one song when Deku brings out his smash). But this was a change to hear a different sense where you didn't really realize the background music, but still noticed it at the same time for it's uniqueness. I'll probably go back and look up the soundtrack to listen to it again because I enjoyed it so much. 
Character: -  
Hmm, the characters had levels of complexity to them..... and they also did not. The ending really showed the true nature of the characters as well as how much they have grown, or not grown because humans are difficult creatures to change in a span of a short time.  
This is why I say they were both complex and not. The audience attaches themselves to the character during the story because, they are very likable characters. All of them. However, most of the characters don't grow beyond their original character designs, making you feel as if you are liking something that you see on paper rather than, well an actual personality.  
It seems rather a vague imitation of a complex personality. They seem really simple.  
Then in the end, they reveal, tada, these people are a lot more complex than you thought. But by then the audience has attached themselves to these characters as a simple character, not a complex thinking one. So when their appearing personality is shown that it was not what it was without any solid resolution to it, you feel distaste on how everyone ended.  
I understand that the characters were sacrificed for the sake of the story telling, but that leaves the audience that these characters were empty shells made for only the purpose of reaching a specific ending and meaning to this story.  
Enjoyment: - 
They did not really think too deep for the enjoyment of the audience. A lot of the episodes feel as fillers, and the overall feel pace of the show is pretty slow despite the fact that they collect the swords quickly. Because of this, I can see why a lot of people feel bored watching this and drop it.  
But I can say it was really enjoyable because the characters are still likable and the driving force of the story (collecting the swords) is really strong despite the fact that you probably know how it is going to end. It's sort of feeds on that guilty pleasure of watching it for the sake of watching and specific things but boy, they were not friendly to the audience on the dynamic.  
It's also the reason why I said you need a specific taste to enjoy the show or else, you'll watch it feeling as if you forced yourself to watch the entire thing only there to be no solid resolve and feeling empty.  
I enjoyed it much more once I realized the main purpose of the anime and what the writer wished to tell. But I have to say, I was thinking WTF IS THIS when I initially finished it.  
TL;DR 
Overall: - 
Overall, I can say, yes it was a good anime. Would I recommend it? If you enjoy anime's where you are sort of left confused and wishing to find a resolve, much like Paprika (although, Paprika and things like Perfect Blue are incomparable) I would recommend it. It's a great time killer in terms of episodes and as a story, allows you to have a good ""Ah hah!"" moment once you piece it all together. But it requires either resolve or a specific taste for certain humor, visuals, etc. to get through the entire series.  
Otherwise, if you are looking for anime with a dramatic resolve and character development (similar to Assassination Classroom which was cute but very very enjoyable), this really isn't the one.  
If I can describe this anime in a sentence it would be, 
An actionish type that gives off a mood of slice of life but oddly has a deeper meaning to it if you look.

Shiki had such an awesome premise, however, from my perspective  it fails to do that premise any justice. I will try my best to give a feel for the story, spoiler free of course. The story and artwork just weren't my cup of tea, but I understand some might enjoy this type of story / cast so I will attempt to avoid outright trolling. 
STORY 
I was very disappointed in the story for a lot of reasons. It progresses painfully slow, and the character development eventually drops just about everyone in the 'gray area' between good and bad. So basically by the time the climax comes around you have nobody to root for. You don't care if any of the main characters survive, shiki or human.  
ART / SOUND 
This is what ruined it for me. I probably would have enjoyed the story more if the art wasn't so ridiculous. The hair on some of the characters...the hair. It's like Super Saiyans on crack. Gravity defiant, logic defying hair that makes the living humans look undead even though they're still alive. The elderly and even some of the young characters (Masao in particular) look hideous right from the start. It's not scary, in my opinion it's just unpleasant to look at. There's not much to say about the Sound. It didn't really leave an impression. The sound effects weren't always used the best way (I.E. Excessive cracking noises coming from a Shiki that is barely moving it's neck) 
CHARACTERS  
A lot of the characters are so incessantly obnoxious to the point where you want them to die. Then they die. Then you realize crap this is Shiki, I have to wait for them to die a second time before I'm through with their BS. Even the characters you like in the beginning betray those good qualities by the middle / end. One more thing, chain smoking doctors aren't cool. You're supposed to be a doctor dammit, save those cigarettes for us non-doctors. 
CONCLUSION 
Shiki failed to live up to my expectations. I feel like Shiki never intended to give you a likeable cast. The point of the story is to submerge you in moral ambiguity with a bunch of mediocre characters and slow moving plot. Most likely the goal was to have the viewer ask him or herself in the aftermath of the climax ""What was (morally) good? What was bad? Was anybody really in the right?"". It's left up to the viewer to decide without the anime deciding which side was 'right' for you. Unfortunately, at least in my case, by the time I got to that point I didn't really care enough about the story, the characters, or the ending to think too hard about it.

I feel like they were trying to pass some kind of message  with this anime, but what, I'm not qualified to tell. 
How can an anime get a - score at EVERYTHING, story, art, sound, character, enjoyment (I would give it less than - if possible) and overall? Well, Mars of Destruction can. 
But I recommend you watch it, it's an experience that everyone should have at least once in their life.  
Besides that, I really can't say much about this anime, I simply don't know what to say, it's like a god that comes to your house and ask you for fried potatoes while drinking coffee, it doesn't make sense and you simply don't know how to react or what to say. That's what Mars of Destruction is, but without the god part.

Isekai is a genre that provides writers with a great opportunity to break the cycle of regularity and add elements that transcend the laws of our own world.  Arifureta however, conveniently steals these elements from other sources and establishes the most boring Isekai which no otaku would ever want to visit and/or save. 
The protagonist is good for nothing in the real world and is called onto the new world to fight the higher powers and save everyone. There is a stupid girl who wears a short blue skirt and bends over every - minutes to show her ass and pees her pants. There is a loli who is from a different race that has very powerful magic. To finish it all off, there is a perverted and well-endowed woman who takes pleasure from being beaten up and ignored. All of this is not a description of Arifureta, it's a description of KonoSuba. I wonder why you would confuse it with a description of Arifureta. 
Stealing from other Isekai is one thing but I would never have expected Arifureta to draw from the elements of classics like Ghost in the Shell and the greatest non-fiction of all time, World Wars I and II. The protagonist is armed with his extraordinary magic and knowledge that he obtained by feeding on monsters deep in the dungeons, and he uses them to make guns? Our protagonist is to this world what Samuel Colt was to ours. If guns are all that's required to save the world, I wonder why the gods would summon a teenager instead of a military technician. Which brings us to another important point, why the hell is our protagonist in a different world? Why was he chosen? How was he transported? The anime conveniently skips all of this to give us what seems like a terrible adaptation of the LN. 
Now, let's move on to the lacklustre fight sequences where the protagonist mows through hordes of enemies without breaking a sweat. The MC is surrounded by about --,--- enemies in the battlefield and standing at the middle of them all, he carefully reloads his gun. The truth is that the MC isn't OP, instead, it is everyone else in this world that is painfully stupid and weak. I never thought I would say this, but this anime's fight scenes are outdone by the imbecilic choreographed fight scenes of Bollywood.  
After painfully dragging myself through this anime, I can say with confidence that it is unentertaining on all fronts. I'm still unable to find a single element which is unique to Arifureta. However, generous as I am, I give Arifureta a -/-- for bearable music and art and a little unusual (definitely not unique) MC characterisation.

Dropped this series with one episode almost finished, too sexual to be anime, but too much plot to be hentai, IT CONFUSES ME SO MUCH! 
So apparently there's some virgin sacrificing cult or something like that, then it cuts to some guy eating his lunch, and has a conversation with some chick and she gets mad at him for eating his lunch... I know right? Weird. 
Then some girl goes to the nurses office and gets raped..? So what happens is a dick magically appears out of nowhere and she starts banging the girl, so this just turned SUPER weird pretty fast, then some other girl confesses her love to the guy who ate the lunch earlier and he apparently has a fetish for smelling a girl's vagina... 
So anyways she wants him to rape her, but if you want it, how can it be considered rape? But, he does it anyways, and they bang in the school gym. Then some dude was walking with his girlfriend then he saw some other girl then he confesses his love for her and they start banging, making his girlfriend cry, so... that's when i decided, ""Nope, i can't do this, this is too stupid."" The only upside was it was fairly easy to masturbate to.

What's there to say that hasn't been said already? This is, is truly a masterpiece. That's a word that has lost a lot of meaning in recent years. With everyone seemingly labeling every above average show as a ""masterpiece."" But when you actually find one that is, suddenly, that word isn't nearly enough of a praise. This is the first, and only show to date. That I've given a perfect score of --/-- across the board.  
In every aspect, from the story, to the openings/ending, the characters, to the attention to detail, and art. Everything is classic. I remember ----, being a -- year old. And seeing this show for the first time. This was one of the first anime i'd ever watched. I'd have - tabs open, each with the next episode. Just so I wouldn't need to press the next episode button. Watching this show is one of the best memories of my childhood I have. That in itself says more than any words ever could about the quality of this show.

Lovely Complex if you liked Kimi ni Todoke there's no doubt you will enjoy this romantic comedy. I was pleased that the story took place over the MC's entire high school life. Seeing them move from one grade to the next in the manner presented is something not that often seen in these types of shows. My biggest fault with the show is that the last - episodes are heavily filled with drama. Of course we love that drama but there was so much going on they were jumping from one thing to the next in the blink of an eye it was kinda hard to keep up with it all. Plus since they moved it along so fast things sometimes were resolved in a WTF manner. I just think they should have spread these last - episodes out into an extra - or - to give the drama time to build more. Other then that it was a really enjoyable love story -/--

GaruPan. is. Back. 
This is quite obviously a - part OVA series. Think, Garden of Sinners movie - or Gundam Unicorn OVA -. Much like those two, das finale OVA- has plenty of hype scenes and a small conflict that is resolved. However much of the runtime is used to setup the tournament that is to unfold in the coming episodes as well as introduce some cool new characters both for Ooatari Joshi and the opponent of the day: UC Academy. UC Academy is a French school and their entire gimmick is a split down the middle modeling the French Revolution. 
Now plenty of people are probably excited for the visuals and audio quality, as GaruPan has pushed those barriers strongly with der Film. And what can I say, it isn't even close: das Finale has raised the bar again and it is so much better than both the TV ver and der Film. The audio is actually modeled in surround as well so it may be awkward for headphone users. I highly recommend a good home theater setup to get the greatest enjoyment. 
And well, that's all that there is to say since talking about the plot of a sub hour OVA really isn't useful. Just go watch it! Issa good.

Trinity Seven is a plot-heavy action/magic based show, it's definitely a bit of a thrill ride, though, it has to include mammoth amounts of contextual information and scene setting, just you that you know what's going on - and even then, the fantasy details can be bit confusing. 
The show is quite --faced, as can be observed from its ability to go from serious plot-related events, to... ecchi. While at the start, i felt this just got in the way, it did (unfortunately) turn out to be slightly relevant during some later episodes. 
Still i WOULDN'T say that ""it's all about Harem"", as there really is a serious story to be told. I loved the plot twists, the suspense, and the realizations. Though, it's all presented in an ""immediate scope"" - meaning that there's no time for any additional character development, or details that could make it easier to become better acquainted with the Trinity Seven.  
It seems that at times, particularly near the start - they tried to rectify this, with a slower pace: which did help induce a definite sense of wonder and mystery when i begun watching. 
Though, with the added pressure of only -- episodes to tell a story worthy of a much larger anime title, like a kid drawing ""bubble letters"", it seemed that after the half way mark, they were running out of space, and so a significant amount of content had to be lost in order to convey the bare bones of the story. 
If you're planning to watch as a thriller, then this really does do action, suspense, AND PLOT TWISTS! 
- rather well. Though, those of you looking for something with more vividness may want to look elsewhere.

I really hope more people can give this anime a shot. I watched the first three episodes and kept on complaining why there is such a stupid show(Because I am more into serious shows). 
But because I got tired of dropping animes so I tried going on, and the more I progress the more I am impressed. The storyline is AWESOME~! Everything is planned pretty carefully and everything mentioned in the show is connected to the story's main plot.  
Plus the anime's concept is somehow pretty fresh, our typical superheroes are usually pretty low profile, wearing a mask and stuff and never ever reveal their arrest or their names/faces to the public, while this show the heroes are pretty high profile, LOL. 
I mentioned this point above but I really still wanna praise the storyline once more. (Thumbs up) 
And now that I think back the reason I say the first few episodes are boring is because that the first few episodes are filled with character development, they really explained each heroes, which makes sense =)

I couldn't help to be bored while being interested in the show. I don't mind how long the anime is, as long as I see development and advancement then I wouldn't mind it. However, this show takes forever to conclude any side-story. I would say that it takes up to about - episodes to conclude one story; it should have been at least - episodes because it took quite awhile and a waste of time. 
It was a waste of time to watch some parts of each episode because it chooses to be repitative. You heard this statement before, you've seen this flashback - times already, you don't need to do long pauses every second, so can we just move on from it and call it a memory to remember while watching this? No. They have to keep reminding you over and over how every character feels, and it doesn't seem necessary. 
I wasn't interested in the characters, rather, I was more interested in the side stories and the main story. All the characters seemed bland and noncompetitive, they were just generic characters.  Even though the stories took awhile to conclude, it's partially what helped it to be watchable. 
What also kept me going was the art style. I loved the art. Sometimes it felt great to watch while seeing the characters interact, but you'll catch that some scenes look like they were showing off their art. I am not interested in a art contest; I want to watch a show with great quality.  
I give this anime a -/--, by the way, it was a boring romantic story.

As a massive Galaxy Angel fan, I gotta say, Galaxy Angel Rune didn't work for me and I am kinda dissapointed. The humor I loved is very different from the original Galaxy Angel series, stories were forgettable, characters as well. There just wasn't anything special about it. The whole anime just didn't really work for me. 
Stories are basically a slice of life, like in the original series - nothing surprising here. But like I said, they were forgettable and bland. However, I appreciate that there were episodes featuring characters from original Galaxy Angel. And not just that! One episode even featured Dejiko from Di Gi Charat, which really made me happy, because my love for Di Gi Charat is forever deep in my heart. 
However, most of the characters from Rune are pretty bland. After watching the whole Galaxy Angel Rune, I still only remember only one character by name - and that's Nano-Nano Pudding. She was very fun character, often oblivious to what is happening around her (which is great), all around fun character, which I enjoyed watching. She is ending every sentence with ""nano da"", which made her memorable too. Another character I liked was Apricot (however, didn't like her enough to remember her name, I had to look it up at the moment of writing this review). And I mostly liked her because she was very cute and similar to Milfeulle from the original series, who was clumsy and often messed things up - but that was the reason why I liked her. The rest of the characters from Galaxy Angel Rune crew are completely forgettable and I don't remember their names at the time of writing this. Or anything about them, really. Who is Anise? Who is Kahlua? Who is Tequila? It's like they were background characters for me. I had the feel that they wanted to emulate original characters. Anyway, it's definitely a step down from original Galaxy Angel series which had really sharp and distinguishable characters and every single one of them had something I liked, which made for very diverse range of personalities, which actually were very well balanced - their diversity felt natural and not forced. 
What I liked was music. Openings and endings were great and very catchy, as is usual with anything produced by Broccoli. Studio did a great job with this. I always loved watching openings and endings. Artstyle was also nice to look at, as is usual with Broccoli. Animations were nice. With the exception of the last episode - I felt that artists didn't really care about the last episode, so there are plenty of scenes where characters look really bad - their eyes are veeery far away. If you know that funny picture with ""Place for rent"" written on the forehead of anime characters, then, unfortunately, one of the three characters in that picture is taken from this show. 
In conclusion, I gotta say - if you're not extreme Galaxy Angel fan who has to see everything Galaxy Angel, you can safely skip this one. You're not gonna miss much. However, as a Galaxy Angel fan, I can't rate this -/-- as I would do, I am forced to rate this -/--, because it's bad. It's mediocre anime, but it's a bad Galaxy Angel.

This review only applies for the first - episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for. 
First of all I'd have you known something really important. The genres presented by MAL aren't accurate. They forgot to add Military, Romance, School, Slice-of-Life, Vampires. And possibly all of this jumbled up in its midst makes it a parody too. I did find it hilarious, myself. I mean, space, military, vampire, slice-of-life? Gotta love that. 
First I'll start because I wanna get to the good stuff faster by saying that the art and sound of the anime is nothing impressive in of itself, it's completely generic. The soundtrack is nothing which I'd listen to outside of the anime, so it probably wouldn't bother you or impress you. 
Let me tell you what the good stuff is. The good stuff is how hilariously bad the anime was so far. No, no, wait, I mean. It's so bad, it's actually entertaining. Like, with a couple more self referencing jokes added to it, it could've been a bitching parody. Now let me tell you about the story. 
So you have this country that is attacked by another country because, well, they have no army. Now, call me stupid, but isn't the whole reason we, humans, stopped warring each other, is because we have mass destructive weapons that could wipe as out and we have devastating tragedies due to shit like this? Shouldn't Japan out of everyone on the planet know the consequences of that? Like, it's not peace everywhere because we grew into being peaceful and loving and we did it for the sake of love and peace. We did it to protect our fucking selves. So, this country in space, we should believe, that there can be a country so incompetent that they won't even build themselves some army or any sort of defense? Yes, because they are incredibly incompetent. I'll get on that later.  
So what's the first thing you think of when you see the tags, action, mecha, space? Is it a school slice-of-life setting? Yeah, me too. So the story follows the life of a school student Horuto which I have to mention because the character is absolutely appaling. I'm gonna give some details about his arc a bit further than the synopsis, so spoiler alert, but they won't ruin the story for you, at least I don't see how, so if you wanna avoid them, continue reading after I finish this paragraph and write SPOILERS OVER. Horuto is basically a shy high school pussy whipped kid who, listen to this, finally decided to tell his love interest, which is pretty much another clutzy sorta tomboyish tropy girl, that he's been in love with her. He almost tells her but everything changed when the Space Nazi attacked. (I forgot the name of the nation and I'm gonna call them that because their salute is Blitzendegen and they love war) Then Horuto was interrupted and then Girl dies. Horuto sees a giant fucking mech. Horuto goes inside giant mech who has him give up his humanity and then starts killing Space Nazis. The people of his country go nuts on Spacebook. Then he gets out of his mech and is killed by a character called Rrgh-Rrghffffu. BUT NO WAIT PLOT TWIST HE BECOMES A BODY SWITCHING VAMPIRE AND THEN STEALS RRGH-RRGHFFFFU's BODY NO WAY! (His name is L-Elf, sometimes the characters rush its spelling and that's how it ends up sounding) More things happen, he gets his body back. He finds out that Girl is still alive. He meets with Girl again. He's been through a war where he could've lost his life, he thought he lost her, he's probably filled with hormones and adrenaline due to being through a life threatening situation and going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Now's the chance, he asked to continue THAT discussion with her. THEN HE DOESN'T DO IT. Then cries. --/-- character. Then also he comments on Spacebook that he's safe and the spacenews channel is like ""BREAKING NEWS, THIS JUST IN, THE HIGH SCHOOL BOY COMMENTED ON SPACE BOOK"".  And I'm not exaggerating, that is literally what happens. 
SPOILERS OVER 
So to sum up everything I said in a non-spoilery way, the story goes in a bunch of ridiculously bad turns, but still somehow remains impressive due to how actually ridiculously and silly it ends up due to it. The characters are completely illogical, the story's logic is also illogical. As an example, there will be characters who get harmed badly by someone, they fucking go ape shit hating them for that, then out of fucking nowhere they will be like. ""ugh, I'm sure they had a good reason. They're a decent person."" Or there will be security unable to stop a guy while he's freefalling, somehow, space buildings can't have automated weapons or anything like that because reasons. Like, you don't have an army, you could at least have some automated security in your goddamned buildings. I could go all day with stuff like this, but I really don't want to spoil the anime for you. 
So the only people I could actually suggest this series too, is someone looking for some series that takes itself somewhat seriously but ends up as incredibly ridiculous, this is what you want. This would be exactly what you want. The reason I dropped it is because I got bored, I didn't see how this could improve, but maybe someday I'll continue this if I'll have someone to watch this with so we would experience this ridiculousness together. Watch it with a friend (Read my edit), it could end up as a good time. But watch it fully knowing that the series will make no sense, most of it will be illogical, none of the characters will actually be appealing and it just will feel as a ""cash money cash dolla' dolla' look at this pile of money we threw in this anime ain't it beautiful this is what you wanted right, IS IT?"" and everything will be ridiculous. If you take this anime seriously, you will fail to enjoy it, so just kick back and prepare for laughter. I'm kinda dissapointed it wasn't satirical, because if it would've been, it would've been really good.  
Slight edit: I've watched more of this series and I don't have a lot to add. The series will have an episode in which it will become a musical. It seems to be getting worse. Pretty much everything I've said stays unchanged, but things seem to be getting progressively worse. I don't plan to continue it and at the time I first wrote this I expected this to be good for a laugh due to how bad it is, but it actually becomes annoyingly bad after a while. I pretty much got forced by a friend to watch it because I forced them to watch it too. Then I couldn't handle it anymore. I can't detail exactly what happens that makes what's bad even worse, but I'll give you a hint which is ""school."" If you think that the school setting for this is already bad, it gets worse. Trust me. If you can't handle worse than what's in the first - episodes, then you can't handle this at all. So after you watch the first - episodes and you still dislike it, you should abandon ship right then and there.

So I think I just watched a -- episode fan fiction or something called Mayoiga. Seriously guys this show was less unintentionally funny and less interesting then Ousama Game (Kings Game) and that was already bad. The most memorable part of this series for me is the opening song. It is catchy and has a completely different vibe from the show which isn't surprising since this show is one huge mess.        The premise is -- young people take a bus trip to a mysterious village to start their lives over. Ok not the most original idea ever but I can work with it sure. It devolves into omg she's a ghost so let's have a witch hunt into why won't you be my puppet boy main character oh why. Then it just kind of ends....like a character says let's leave and the credits roll....I seriously thought I missed something multiple times while watching this series of it gives you an idea how sloppy this was put together. The biggest sin of them all is a HUGE SPOILER SO LOOK AWAY NOW..............................................no one dies. Not a single character. No satisfying gore and mayhem to make up for the lunacy. It's pure psychological comedy.  You got me good Mayoiga.

Before watching Shokugeki, I did not know how to cook. After watching Shokugeki, I don’t know shit about food at all. 
Food so real, you’re going to cry - Shokugeki no Souma review 
The story begins with a cooking face off between Yukihira Souma and his father, Yukihira Joichiro. Ever since Souma began cooking, he has always wanted to surpass his father and take the mantle of the head chef of their family restaurant. Souma is -- and his father has enrolled him into Totsuki academy, the top culinary school in Japan, in order to expand his cooking skills and experience a whole new world of cooking. Now that is what a shounen is. Once he enters Totsuki, during the opening ceremony he makes his dominance palpable to everyone, asserting his confidence that he will not lose to anyone until he defeats his father. 
Along with such an already fantastic start, we’re given great direction and writing to feel what shounen is again, or rather a damn near perfect show. Right at the first few episodes, we’re already introduced to the big shots of the culinary world, each with their own unique tastes and personality. It accomplishes a foreboding atmosphere expressing the skills and craft of those who fight for hegemony of the culinary world. Now that is bad ass. Immediately Souma is engaged in an early battle against one of them, and I think anyone can assume what will happen. 
Since the early days his cooking career began, Souma had always lost to his father, fermenting his skills and experience through loss, especially against one who was once one of the top at Totsuki. From here we learn that our main character isn’t just some cocky and overrated dude. He has legitimate scores to boot what he barks when in face of his peers. Tadokoro Megumi is a shy and feint hearted girl who had yet to break her through her prisoning shell. But through the help of Souma’s advisory and charisma, she is able to bring out her true self and show to the world she isn’t just some useless girl who got lucky in enrolling Totsuki. Nakiri Erina being just about as cocky as Souma isn’t developed as much as our other characters, but slowly with each episode opens to an insight of who Yukihira really is, even though it is situational irony that us the audience already know. However it doesn’t hinder the story one bit. Everyone of the other cast members are given enough time to develop in their own small ways and improve however more enhanced by the dialogue given by spectators, as well as being charismatic in their own right. 
Dialogue and direction of the show is done excellently. For a show that is about cooking, we actually are given enough details to know what ingredients are used in the food and how it is cooked. Each episode we’re introduced to fantastic new dishes from a variety of different cultures from around the world. Not one moment is there overlapping food choices as we are shown food types and ways of cooking normal people outside of the culinary world would never have thought of before. It’s inspiring and does its job of making us hungry, if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Being seriously, it does make you want to eat prior to watching the show.The narrative Shokugeki tells is compelling in the contained story that is it. It is kept small but so varied that not one moment felt dull. 
Shokugeki proves a worthy contender in all categories of art, animation, and sound. The food looks better than anything I’ve seen in real life, I could almost eat it from my screen. Animation is beautifully done. Blended with the art it aspires itself to go beyond each new episode every week, furthering what else it can accomplish. The voice acting and bgms enhance the experience to a whole new level. At first the foodgasms may be a turnoff for the fear of it being overused and pushed into your face just to put out sexual content, it surprisingly handles it maturely at times when it is needed. And it offers comedy in many of those moments as well, like as if the food was so great that Souma literally punched a judge in the face. Openings were alright to me, with the first ending being my favorite of the songs. With all three elements combined, it offers a surrounding greatness to it. 
With all said and done, I think it’s time I gave Shokugeki no Souma a high score of -/-- with a fucking fantastic seal of approval. There are many terrible shows that came out in ----, but Shokugeki proves that there are still shows out there with great writing and stand the test of time. And it is a show that I can recommend with no doubt. It is for sure that this show is one I will use to measure in those of its genre. Now then, I’m off to write my next review.

All reviewers here, including those with a positive, neutral or negative opinion, have a common weakness: they are not japanese. You see, the Up From Poppy Hill movie is special as it exclusively targeted japanese audiences with the main theme of nostalgia and cannot be really understood or properly interpreted from an american or euro-centric point of view. 
In this sense, Poppy Hill is much like Pom Poko: they are so far removed from gaijin (foreigner) experience that it is hard to grasp what they should be about and exporting or licensing them may even be seen as a mistake. Other Ghibli movies are set in fantasy lands or in a romanticized historic setting, thus almost equally approachable for domestic japanese and foreign audiences. 
Poppy Hill is slow-paced exactly because it wants to convey nostalgia towards the pre-----, slower paced and allegedy more wholesome Japan, as opposed to hyper-ness of the ""economic marvel"" era of -------'s or the depressing and increasingly decadent ""lost decades"" since ----. 
Note how several wide agle scenes glorify soot-spewing factory chimneys or smog rolling over the harbour or the endless stream of rickety moto-rickshaws and mini cars negotiating unpaved roads. All those things however, only mean something to (older) japanese people themselves and those foreigners who have long followed proceedings in the island nation. 
Anyhow, the movie itself isn't flawless, even if we only consider its culture-neutral elements. The bespectacled student council president is easily --x as cool a guy as the protagonist and quickly grabbing the younger sister, they easily steal the show from the main couple. The ship captain's participation in Korean War isn't really explained, may be even perceived as contradictionary, considering Japan's well known, post----- strict ""peace constitution"". The role or significance of Umi's apparently extra wealthy grandma remains unexplored. 
On the other hand, Goro Miyazaki seems to have greatly improved as a director beyond the Earthsea shipwreck. He definitely has an eye for comedy, those slap-sticky school club scenes work for all audiences of Poppy Hill. Maybe he should focus on Porco Rosso-like projects, stories that don't try to take themselves too seriously? I feel Poppy Hill somehow owes to Porco Rosso, more or less the student posse are the former air pirates? Yet, the more desperate parts of Poppy Hill sometimes feel forced, as if drama wasn't Goro's strong point.

You know, I put up with a lot of shit when it comes to hentai, but at some point you have to draw the line. 
This is where I draw the line. 
Okay so not only do you have a creepy molester dude having sex with teenage girls on the fucking train, but like... just look at the dialogue throughout this mess. It's really fucked up when you stop beating off for a moment and actually read the subtitles. Many of the characters are being molested by their fucking families and they express this while the creepy molester dude is having sex with them. I even recall one line of dialogue where (explicit warning) the molester is talking about having sex with the baby he has with the girl he's having sex with and she has no issue with that whatsoever. 
What. The. Fuck. 
Oh, and the characters proportions are gross too. 
So yeah, honestly go watch Mankitsu Happening or a hentai that's not appalling.

This was one of those series that I had randomly happened to stumble upon on one of my days off. It just so happened to hook and reel me in so strongly that I started and finished all -- episodes in one sitting -- with the obvious restroom and food breaks. That said, I have no regrets about those -- hours of my life. 
Although this series had the potential for a lot of overwhelming magic battles, a majority of the fights were fought through words and plot devices. I'm not really one for drawn out dialogues, but within this series, it was very well done and kept me hooked. There were three consecutive episodes where the characters hadn't moved an inch, but I hadn't noticed -- and wouldn't have cared even if I did. I was at the edge of my seat until the end.  
I really enjoyed the characters. I'm normally a freak for romance, but didn't even mind that there was no hint or suggestion of such until mid-series. The two main protagonists gave me a Nartuo x Sasuke feel, and the plot had set up for many instances where that rivalry could stir up -- but both were able to handle things maturely. Which I feel is pretty rare in anime, so that was pleasantly surprising.  
The plot itself was fairly original. I enjoyed the way that by mid-series, I had trained myself to expect the unexpected. This led to my only anticipating a few key parts of the story, as opposed to having most plot ""mysteries"" figured out before they were revealed, per usual.

GARBAGE. The fight scene are repetitive and kyou has almost never lost a fight. Kyoshiro isnt even the MC its kyou. Kyoshiro is a WAYYYYYYYYYY BETTER character than kyou. Yuya , falls for kyou, despite him being an asshole op who doesnt deserve shit. Whilst kyoshiro (original mc) iv abandoned for half the manga and and is shit on. POOR BEsT BOI. Yuya is a hoe who secretly likes kyou grabbing her boobs and ass and only follows him to get that kyou dick. Back to the fight scenes here is the formula 
same old attacks> kyou is almost losing and still is cocky> kyou wins 
btw kyou is FUCKING UGLY.

I started watching this anime strictly because it was marked as school life, romance, and comedy. I nearly clicked away within the first five minutes. However, despite the unwarranted fanservice in episode -, this soon became one of my favourite series ever. It was excellently written, and I truly empathized with the characters more so than I ever have in the past (except Watamote), I wanted SOMETHING to finally go right so bad! I'm used to the feeling at the end of a good anime, but Sakurasou? I've never felt more depressed about the end. ALthough it is set up well for a season -, I don't think that we'll ever get one. I strongly recommend watching it, as you will not regret it.

Wimpy guy. 
Annoying ""heroine"". 
Lousy monsters. 
And a lot o ecchi. 
What do you think when you read ""a school atended by monsters""? It gives you a certain thrill? Well, you possibly think that it will give you a scare? Well then, forget it. The ""monsters"" here are nothing but a joke.  
There's this Tsukune guy. He just entered the school, unaware of the fact that the student body is composed of nothing more, nothing less than monsters. And hot chicks that are monsters. 
There he meets four hot chicks: Moka; the main one, Kurumu; the main responsible for the ecchiness in the show, Yukari; cute and annyoing, and Mizore; who I thought it would save the anime in my eyes.  
Tsukune himself doesn't help. He is such a bloody wimp. Don't get me wrong here. I'm all for female heroines especially in anime/manga since the japanese culture isn't flattering of favorable to women in general. But come on, did he need to be SUCH a WUSS?  
That's not all. If the poor characterization wasn't enough, then you are prone to be disappointed over the story line. 
In the end, the best thing you can get (and possibly enjoy, depending on your preferences) is the Ecchi factor.  
Now, I'm only rating the anime here. I haven't read the manga, so I can't judge it. All I can say is that after giving the anime a try, I wouldn't be able to find a place in my ""plan to read"" list for the manga. 
My ratings: 
Story: -- - Pathetic 
Art: -- - Fair 
Character: -- - Dreadful * 
Enjoyment: -- - Pathetic 
Overall: -- - Poor 
Sound: I don't remember and won't play it again to verify it. 
(*) I only gave - points to the Character factor because of Mizore and the tiny hope I had for her. Even though this hope was unfulfilled.

The reason why I thought I'd watch this was because I love reverse harem!! 
One girl - Himeno destined to be the pretear and fight against the evil princess who is draining leafe (a kind of life source) from the world... surrounded by - guys.... 
Kind of reminded me of sailormoon how she changes into costumes... but the wierd thing was- by combining with each individual guy. So if you think about it -- episodes for the series... - changes with - diff guys and thats half the series gone just introducing the individual changes very briefly... 
With all that taken into account, i felt the anime lacked a strong storyline and never really gave any depth to any of the characters...... Normally in a good anime I always feel a strong attraction to at least one of the characters but I didnt get that with this. 
Despite there being seven pretty boys, theres only really one love interest and the others are just background roles with three of them being little kids... but thats just me being bias i guess as i love a plot when the main female lead has more than one love interest. 
Overall it was fine to watch if you enjoy a girl changing costumes, trying to save the world with her love and lots of male eye candy. 
With it only being -- episodes I wouldnt call it a waste of my time and it is easy to watch with little brain power needed!

The Adventures of Gary Stu and his friends - The Animation. 
He can do everything, convenient turns in the plot and plot devices for everything. If you are -- or lower, you should watch this. If you are -- or higher and you watch this, grow up already. 
The music is just like everything done by Kajiura, only Madoka Magica sounds sort of different. The art is great though. 
Also, SAO ended in ep-- for me.

I seen Dragon Ball Z - times already and although i'm a big fan of this anime that doesn't mean I won't talked about the flaws it has. Is my all time favorite because is not like most cliche anime, Dragon ball Z stand on it's own. I'm going to talk about the anime that got me started watching other animes. 
Story- They story keeps changing but is really simple to follow, is the plot is basically Goku and his friend defend earth from evil beings. I Like how there is always a new threat that arrives and Goku and his allies has to find a way to defeat the enemy so earth won't be destroyed.  Most of the time the pacing is really slow like when Goku is about to fight a villian and you have to wait like -- episode for the fight to actually go down, lol. If you are unpatient this can be a bad thing for you.  
Art- I like old school anime so I though it looked great for its age, so no complaints. 
Sound- Great editing expectially in the fight scenes, very well done. 
Character- They were none cliche characters that you see in a lot of animes, they all looked different and were unique in their own ways. I liked every of the Z fighters even if some of them weren't as strong as Vegita or Goku (like Krillin) they still wanted to fight for their lives and their friends life, you got to respect a character like that. The villians were also great. you knew right away that they were a threat and we the Z fighters had a lot to deal with if they want to defeat them. Great character development that you felt the connection with each of the characters that you also felt worried for them. 
Love the protagonist Goku that never gives up ( Although he is a bit too trusting at times) and my favorite wich is Trunks. 
Enjoyment- Like I said before, I rewatch Dragon Ball Z - times and will do it again because is a lot of fun to watch. With great characters, great story that changes with each saga, Dragon Ball Z is not an anime you want to miss. I recommend this anime to all anime fans.

Oh Fup the L YES!!! Do I even have to say anything? IT'S HELSING ULTIMATE, it speaks for itself! But I will say that the Nazi commander, though sick in the head, I LOVE how passionate he is. Even if he has a disturbing boner from cruel, outright genocide, you have to admire the simple fact that he can perfectly describe what and why he loves it so much. He's doing what he loves and that's a thumbs up in my book. Alucard is still my favorite though.

When you look at something like Queen’s Blade Rebellion at face value, you do not think immediately “cash grab.” Or at least you hope to god that it is not. Then while you are watching it, it is very clear that the reality of the situation is clear; and it is exactly what you feared it might be. A complete nothing cash grab with no soul or style to speak of. 
Now as I have said before in my previous reviews of the series, Queen’s Blade is not what many perceive it to be: A completely dumb titty anime with no plot or characters to care about. While the dumb titty anime part is not exactly far from the truth, I found the plot and characters to be better than your average ecchi series to the degree of Queen’s Blade. It is not by any means brilliant, but for what they are, they are fun and entertaining in their own right. However, after watching Queen’s Blade Rebellion, I feel like all of those accusations could fit with this season more than any of the others. It’s almost as if they hired the writers who have never watched the previous seasons and only know it vaguely and wrote a story that they feel would fit the show to a T. 
Halfway through watching Rebellion, it hurt. Like it was almost like watching a completely different anime series. For one, this season feels like the one with the least comedy and more drama. With any other anime, this might be an okay sign but not with Queen’s Blade. I never anticipate the drama and boy does it not work with this one. It does not help the fact that the story in this is completely incomprehensible and not focused in the slightest. It is similar to the criticisms I had with the first season being unfocused in completely different subplots I did not care for. At the very least with Rurou no Senshi, the plot was simply a battle royale between different female fighters to achieve being the Queen’s Blade. In Rebellion, it is a literal rebellion against a tyrannical queen that wants to control everything. Yet, the rebellion does not feel like anything grand or sophisticated at all. It just feels like a bunch of adventurers farting around with their own common goal. 
The new characters that are in Rebellion are an absolute atrocity to the Queen’s Blade series. No memorability or soul to speak of within any of their character archetypes. The only hope I had with a character being memorable was Mirim because her story was sympathetic enough for me to gravitate towards. That, of course, was immediately cut once her troubles were erased by Luna Luna and there was literally no point in her being the story in the -nd half. The “main protagonist” Annelotte has to be the most nothing anime protagonist I have ever witnessed in quite some time. She has no personality to make her interesting, no interesting motivation to the conflict at hand, and her interactions with the other characters are banal at best. Luna Luna could have at least been a nice sexy cutie for me to look at with her magical codpiece, but good god she was an absolute annoyance to the show halfway through and that pains me to say to a character voiced by Harumi Sakurai (Ryouko from Anejiru). 
The rest of the characters are already too forgettable for me to even comment about. However, what I can comment on are the characters they decided to bring back from the previous seasons. First off, no Menace, no buys. Sorry but that is just inexcusable in my eyes. Secondly, what is the point of even bringing these characters back? Why is Ymir all of the sudden serving the Queen and turning bad? What was the point of bringing Melona back at the last two episodes? Why is Elina now bad? No convincing explanation for any of these situations. If I were in a writer position, I would just make this into its own self-contained story that has nothing to do with the previous seasons. It would at least feel less of a complete cash grab to try to entice old fans into watching this. 
Nothing has changed in the technical aspects from previous seasons in terms of the action set-pieces and character designs. They still look nice and the action is still fun to look at even though they got a little samey after a while. It is thanks to this that this show does not get a completely horrendous score on my grading scale. 
If this was one way to kill a franchise, this was the perfect way to do it. Not that this will since Hobby Japan still makes tons of merch for this show, even though they have only released small OVAs since this season from ---- with no new tv series on the horizon as of writing this review. I do not know what the future will hold for another season, whether they will go back to the original characters or try to do another new cast or, god forbid, try to continue this story considering how horribly cop-out the ending was. I would say it can only get better from here, but I am not holding my breath that happening. 
Grade: D

A TV series about GO? 
Must be boring hm? 
No must not!!! 
Hikaru no Go is one of the interestings Sports Series you'll find 
at the moment. 
The difference between other Sport Anime is that Hikaru is not  
the guy who's only winning every game. 
No he has first to learn the game and he will lose many times. 
Its much more interessting to see how he grow up 
unlike Prince of Tennis who the Protagonist is only Winning.

Ok, I know I'm not suppose to make a review on the -st ep of an anime (OVA doesn't count), but after viewing this kind of horror(that's just me) i suddenly realize that this thing is not my cuppa tea.So how do I rate this OVA? Here's how: 
Story - Dreadful number -. 
Frist of all the story of this OVA is very simple.................there's isn't any, it's all about the masochistic  Nana who feels arouse by Kauro's sadistic and perverted psychological maneuvers. 
Art - Very Good number -. 
I like the way Nana was drawn and how the people were drawn too. 
Sound - Fair number -. 
Nothing much to say here. 
Character - Poor number -. 
Ok, thought Nana's erotic deed maybe titillating, I really hate her masochistic role, as for the diablo (Karou), I would really want to do what Sanzo does to Goku from ""Saiyuki,""  when he's pissed, and that is to hit him on the head with a big and hard paper fan, co'z I not only hate his role ( kauro) I also hate his smirk when he does his perverted fantasy to Nana.  
Enjoyment-  Dreadful number -. 
For those of you who's gonna hate me for writing this kind of review, let me remind you "" that this is just me,"" if any of you guys like this OVA, then you like it and that's that, so let's keep it like that. 
Overall - Dreadful number -. 
I'm ain't commenting anymore, by the way, I really don't suggest that this be viewed by teens -- and below, also I don't recommend to anybody to try what you see  at home unless you're really sick. View it with according to your own discretion.

The manga storyline was very slightly, and I do mean very, intriguing, and since the anime is rated so highly, I decided to give it a chance and hope the animation would not be the typical fake glossy stuff we get now, the voice acting would not be shrill typical moe quality, and that the promised added details and stories would be interesting. Unfortunately, every one of those hopes was failed. 
First of all, the art and animation is mostly terrible. Sure some of the movement is ""slick"", but the animation is always glossy, the character art is as bad as you would expect from the manga made worse with coloring, and the awkward zooms and movement during action scenes ruins any hope of excitement. This is definitely not enjoyable to look at any time in the episodes I watched, and was cringe inducing with the bigger mistakes (like during the first episode with the first time she fires lightning, and her face practically melts). 
The voice acting is terrible shrill typical bad moe stuff. Not a single character sounded good, and even as someone who hates this type of fake ""cute"" voice acting I usually find that some will sound good. Furthermore, the sparkly sound effects are again cringe inducing. 
The added details in the story so far involve more bad gags (like HRHR LOOK AT ALL MY SEXY PANTIES or THE STRIPPER LADY!!) and not much else. Yeah, some extra ""depth"" to the characters was added in like episode -, but the additions were not interesting because the characters were not interesting. For the first couple of episodes, the extra slice of life storylines might be nice for some people, but I spent the first two episodes skipping to the action after a few exasperated minutes. 
All I can say is that this seems to be an already extremely typical manga made into a typical anime that was very poorly executed. The action scenes I skipped to hoping for something to salvage matters were really bland...just nothing worthwhile here as far as I can see.

Full-metal Alchemist Brotherhood: is a fantastic anime that should be recommend to everyone. It is clear why this is number #- and it should stay like that.  
The story line untangles the more you experience each episode which allows the show to be re-watchable. You cannot get everything with just one go. 
Character development is well thought out and each character feels unique and has a personality. The enemy and the citizens feel unique as well. Personally i felt sympathy for the enemy as their personality has reason and depth. 
Music was on-point and was thought-out to fit with scenarios that develop the story as well. It isn't music that was fitted in to fill the emptiness in battle but music to drive emotions into the watcher. 
I never felt bored of the series as each episode intrigued me even more and i felt shock after realizing the connections to the story between episodes by the end of each episode. There was never a ""filler episode"" and it was all planned out. 
It was never dragged on to force a show and was ended perfectly leaving the person watching wanting another series, but i'm glad there is not because a good story needs a good ending.

Steins;Gate is not just one of the best anime series out there, but one of the best Science Fiction series I've seen in general. All of the positive things you've heard about it are true. It's like one of the best Twilight Zone episodes, exploring how regular people would react to an incredible event.  
The characters are without a doubt the best part of the show. Every one of them is developed well, and by the end you feel very invested in their story. They all have unique personalities and quirks. They're not defined by those traits, however, and each develop throughout the series. Okabe and Makise are definitely the best. They react to the time travel realistically, with both fascination and fear. They're relationship with the other characters and each other develops naturally, and is honestly one of my favorite parts of the show. 
The story itself is also great. The way time travel works is unique, having a lot of different rules and possible unforeseen problems, which is to be expected of any good time traveling setup. There are a lot of twists and turns, but without getting too hard to follow. Like any great science fiction story, it doesn't just focus on the fantastical events, but also on how characters react to them and how it effects society. 
The only real downside of the series is that the first - or - episodes are a bit slow. They are still interesting, and necessary for setting up the characters, but it was a bit boring at first. That is a minor problem, however, as those episodes are still enjoyable. Overall, this is a great anime.

""Are you going to destroy the world ?""  
- Lisa Mishima  
'Zankyou no Terror' or 'Terror in Resonance' is the epitome of modern thriller anime. It is clean cut off from any type of supernatural or fantasy seasoning. Zankyou no Terror revolves around the post events of a failed experiment that gathered intellectually gifted orphans from all around the Japan to make a medicine that would excel human brain further. With clever plot design and extraordinary voice acting, this anime is bound to grip you tight. It is one of the anime which will keep kicking you back to your seat either with its mix of cheeky and smart characters or mind blowing scenes. Compile all that with a good amount of thought provoking canon puzzles and blasts; you get a great anime. 
I will not be exaggerating if I say characters from Zankyou no Terror are some of the most interesting ones not only from this season but maybe a past few. Two young smart rebels, Nine and Twelve, who happen to come across a rather airhead and slow-wit girl Lisa. I can't help but point out to her character she is just adorable, and I don't say that a lot. And of course no character list is complete without that one antagonist we all hate, Five, I wouldn't spoil much but damn it is fairly rare to come across an antagonist like her.  
All that with a great mix of original soundtrack and beautifully drawn art. You'll not feel the passage of time when you watch this anime.  
-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED- 
Pros :  
+ Clever thought provoking plot 
+ Bombs Bombs Bombs!  
+ Smart side-characters, smarter antagonist, smartest MCs 
+ That ending. 
Cons :  
- A lot of scenes feel rushed  
- That ending...

“Harry Potter but with cute anime girls.” 
I initially started watching this show as my comfy anime. While it certainly is that… it’s so much more. 
The show drew me in with its pastel colour scheme and amazing character design. Akko is both adorable and loveable, which, I guess, goes for all the characters. Expressive faces and great voice acting. The show is colourful, but in a very tasteful way. 
I was kept engaged by the great athmospheric music, which paired amazingly with the visual design. In addition to that, both OPs and the ED are straight bangers. Moreover, the character interactions and cutesy humor were top notch. This show has put a smile of my face so many times. Sometimes it was because of the humor, sometimes because of the ridiculousness, endearingness and occasional innocence that is Akko. 
I was caught by surprise by the superb character development and depth (especially when compared to the ---- material). Almost every character is flawed, but oh so loveable and understandable at the same time.  
Lastly, the show took me by surprise with the amount of times it got me to tear up. At first glance it looks like just a comfy anime suitable for kids… but I have to say, with the themes of perseverance, failure and friendship it’s a real tear jerker. Somehow I’ve got to care so much about these characters. It also helps that the emotional moments are supported really well by musical and visual climaxes that (most of the time) build up and release tension extremely well. The characters are badass (shout out to my girl Ursula) and the stakes feel very real. 
My only complaint is that the story in the second arc feels a bit off. I can’t really go into too much detail without spoiling the story. What I can say is that I feel a certain character had plot armour and got away with a lot. 
This show has truly caught me by suprise with its quality. If you’re looking for a comfy anime with great art, music, characters and an emotional touch, look no further. Yay!

Haven't read the manga or the LN, but the script writing for this anime adaptation is entirely middle school grade - I know because I wasn't any better than this when I was in middle school. Absolute garbage. 
So MAL wants me to write a longer review, so here's a few recommendations for other shows to watch that also aired this (Spring ----) season: 
-) Midara no Ao-chan no Benkyou ga Dekinai 
-) Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san 
-) Sarazanmai  
-) Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin (bit of a hit or miss, this one. I loved it) 
-) Kono Oto Tomare! 
-) Senryuu Shoujo 
You're welcome goddamit.

People want honest reviews - so here's my personal opinion of the Second Season:  
I felt that it is Crap. 
My reasoning is as follows: 
Little to no plot development from the first season.  For a story to succeed - it must go somewhere.  This storyline did not go anywhere.  It's like you're on a ferris wheel and you're back to the start at the end of Season -.  Except you're back at the Start of Season - and not - when everything was fresh and fun. 
Examples: 
a. The Locket part of the story never went anywhere.  Those episodes should be considered ""filler"" as they never developed it.  The locket is broken, it gets fixed, and then they don't go anywhere with it.  It's a focus then they drop the focus entirely and go onto other things. 
b. Character interactions were exactly the same at the end of the -nd season as they were at the end of the first.  After -- episodes you'd think there'd be clear interests happening.  Yet - No - there were no clear direction of any interests except for the last episode and the story behind that was weak at best. 
c. Raku's love interest in Onodera should have shown some change - but no - it's exactly the same as season -.  Where there should be some type of building/lowering of character interest/love between the two there's only - (-?) episodes then it's on to something else. 
Finally - but not least - they lost the little bit of fan service they had and turned it into a Rom Com entirely.  At least with the first season there was a little fan service that really made the Comedy even more funny. 
This season they tossed it to the wayside and tried to push a straight Rom Com on us.  My opinion is that they failed horribly in changing the dynamics from the first to second season. 
While the the first season I give a solid - - I can't find myself giving this season anything more than a -.  For the artwork alone.

Footloose is ---- musical film directed by Herbert Ross and named after a terrible Kenny Loggins song.  The film stars Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack, an upbeat Chicago native who finds himself in downbeat Bomont, Utah.  But wait a second, we’re not supposed to be talking about Footloose.  We’re here to discuss Cipher The Video, the greatest manga trailer and The Video ever made. 
Cipher is a shoujo manga about a girl in love with a boy with a twin brother who switches places with him sometimes.  At least that’s what I think it is.  It takes place in America maybe?  I’ve never read the manga, I’ve just seen The Video.  Normally you’d think after watching what’s supposed to be an adaptation you’d have some sort of idea of what the source material is like.  The Video doesn’t play that way, it has its own rules.  And by own rules I mean there’s one rule, no rules. 
Cipher is essentially a series of music videos broken up by intermissions.  If you direct your attention towards the staff section, you’ll notice a few things.  A couple of names and faces might ring a bell.  For example, Phil Collins, as in Phil Collins the guy who did the soundtrack to Tarzan.   Also Kenny Loggins, hence the talk of Footloose earlier.  Oh and some black lady who did that song about hearing it for the boy that’s god awful.  They aren’t there as a joke, they have songs featured in Cipher The Video.  And oh boy are some of them featured.  “Against All Odds” opens it up, “Let’s Hear It For The Boy” really introduces us to the impending disaster, “Footloose” gets two encores, and “Against All Odds” ends our suffering.  I’m not ---% on the ending song, I’m only basing that on MAL’s info because hell if I could remember anything that was going on by the time it ended. 
Watching Cipher isn’t really as interesting as thinking about Cipher.  When you watch it, you’ll quickly realize something went wrong.  I mean, there’s no way it was intended to be like this.  Only a small portion is actually animated, a lot of it is just still frames.  There’s also a distinct lack of voice acting.  Direct your attention to the characters.  Two of the three have no voice actor listed because there’s no voice actor at all.  Outside of maybe one or two lines, all of the voice acting takes place during a interview of the main character.  The version I watched had poor (in both acting ability and audio quality) English voice acting.  MAL has a Japanese VA for him, so who knows if that was supposed to be a dub.  I’m almost inclined to believe it was the original due to Japanese subs and a comment I read about how the director wanted that authentic western feel.  I don’t know what to believe. 
In summation, Cipher was probably supposed to be a real anime but then God intervened and said “fuck that noise, make it surrealist art.”

Well, in my perspective, these (i only watched - so far) dont count as OVA...it's more like soft-H version of the Freezing, with new Vibration chars. Because not only they dont have any stories...it also not too propriate to watch them in public. 
Overall the art is the same as the original. 
- stars for you who's looking for fan service (- stars would be full-H for me) 
- star for you who seeks some side stories

This isn't a review per say but more of my opinion on the anime in general. School Days was interesting and to tell you the truth it just pissed me off. I'm a guy myself and seeing this just makes me want to beat the living day out of the male protagonist. A story like this is just way to aggravating for someone like me people like that are nothing but scum in my eyes, I know its a story but it also tells you that things like this do happen and they'll continue to happen if you allow it to continue. Peace of advice if your going through something like this or know someone who is simply punch the living day out of the guy or slap the girl if its reversed. And make it clear that people like that are nothing but dirty perverted scum that don't deserve to have any ones love. 
I never wanna see a story like this again. 
I'll never let it happen to anyone I know.

Re:Zero is an interesting anime that brings about a cool concept. 
Story: - 
The story is extremely interesting, about a boy, Subaru, who exits the convenience store and suddenly ends up in another world. He is cornered in alley but is saved by a girl, Satella. He follows her on her quest to retrieve her insignia, something that is very important to her. They arrive at a house in the slums, and get killed. However, the boy comes back to life, but in the past. He can start over from zero. 
I quite enjoyed the story, as you never know when Subaru can finally pass the stage where he can't get past and keeps dying, it adds a lot of suspense. He has to figure out ways to get past the problems blocking his way from survival. At some points, the story can turn a little sad too. The character interactions were also rather interesting. 
However, what I didn't like is that some questions were not answered in the end. Of course, it's possible that there'll be a Season -, but what we have now in the anime isn't enough to understand some stuff, in my opinion. 
Art: - 
The art and animation is really cool and nice. The colours used are great and nice to look at. I quite like the art style as well. The effects are also pretty cool. 
Sound: - 
I love all the OPs and EDs, they are really beautiful and enjoyable. The music in the anime itself is also really nice and helps to create the atmosphere. The voice acting was brilliant, and the seiyuus were able to flesh out the characters really well and bring them to life, with different expressions. 
Character: - 
At first I didn't really like Subaru's personality, but I grew to like it over the course of the anime. There are also some other characters that I don't really like, but I don't think whether you like the characters or not affects your overall enjoyment of the anime. I didn't find any of them overly whiny, flawed or way too perfect. (ok maybe Reinhard, but still) The character designs all look very good and independent to build up more of the character. Character chemistry and relationships were also pretty good. There was some character development for a few of the characters, and some of them were revealed to have rather interesting backstories. I don't think there were too many characters. 
Enjoyment: - 
It's extremely enjoyable, even though some parts are there to make you cringe, most of the time it is rather easy to laugh at what is happening. The fights are epic, and you never know what might happen next. The tension is great. 
Overall: - 
Overall I really do recommend this anime to everyone, especially those who like psychological fantasy anime. It is quite enjoyable and definitely not a waste of your time! 
I hope this helped! :)

If I would have to review this in - words, it obviously be ""what the fuck"". 
This is a - minute short about a forest and it's residents presented in a really fucking weird way. 
Watching this made me visibly uncomfortable, and by that I mean I could just switch to -rd person view and see myself sitting there not knowing what is going on. So there is this guy who dressed up as a penguin and became the protector of the forest in which the animals live in. 
The whole thing looks like a powerpoint presentation, but it was made by a single person so you can't really expect anything spectacular in that expect, but holy shit the faces are a little disturbing. 
Literally everyone is voiced by one guy, which just makes it even weirder, and the bee... 
I don't want to talk about thet bee, I will probably never forget that. 
I have no idea how people come up with ideas like this, or how much weed they need to smoke before a creation like this, but it's definitely a lot.

Fruits Basket Zenpen.  
Firstable, this was my first Fruits Basket experience so I can't compare it with the original version or manga 
A show packed with feelings, drama and metaphors.  
While I doubt that I got every metaphor there was, it still was very enjoyable.  
Each character is interesting and has some backstory, giving them all a nice depth to them.  
The art and music are just beautiful which leads to a very calming atmosphere. And the atnosphere is just great for this shows emotions, feels like a cure for depression 
But while the feelings shown are really great, the romance progresses soo slowly really. That is kind of a pain tbh 
Overall -/--. Maybe it's because I'm nit intelligent enough to appreciate the literal art in this one but for me it's ""just"" -/--

""Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo"" is one hell of an anime, i am glad it got an equally amazing Studio Deen to work on it. From the ever so glorious Log Horizon to Konosuba, this studio has come so far beyond the depths of a fantasy world, that it will be the go-to studio for such kind of work. 
The show produced is a Gag of what a typical heroic tale is & filled with sarcastic, narcissistic, masochistic leads that will make you go WTF with laughter, the women leads of the show are what you call the perfect anime dreamgirls, not only they are like cute, adorable cats but their annoying nature is pretty goddarn cute too. 
This is an anime that will make you go gochisousama. So every anime fan should experience this wonderful whatever. I could go on about everything in detail but i want the reader to start this joyride ASAP.

>>If a well written anime series is a Mozart piece, this series is a bratty boy slamming his tiny fists on the same piano key over and over and over again while being obnoxiously proud of his musical prowess.<< 
If you're familiar with the characteristic tropes of the isekai genre, you will spot a lot of them in this series. Some cliches are fun and entertaining, and having them really isn't a problem... unless that's literally ALL you do. There is no tension in this anime. Each and every time something interesting could happen, the show spits in your face as the problem at hand is solved within seconds by Gary Stu, our stupidly broken main character. The plot can be fully expressed by the following - lines of text: 
-. Someone has a problem which nobody can solve - IF ONLY somebody could use THAT ONE specific spell that would immediately solve the problem! 
-. Gary Stu comes along by coincidence and uses THAT ONE spell. 
-. The problem is solved, Someone falls for Gary Stu. 
-. Back to - 
The only measure of plot progress in this series is the number of girls that are in love with the main character. At any point in the series, if you can think of multiple variations of how the plot might play out, you can almost be certain that the show will choose the blandest of them. Every character in the show can be fully expressed in less than -- words, a fact that won't change no matter how many episodes of screentime they get. 
Now, for the technical part: 
Art and animation are painfully mediocre, nothing stands out except for some really terrible lip synching. 
The soundtrack's only purpose is to tell you how you should feel at any given moment. Sadly, it doesn't do a good job, for it only leaves you with feelings of disgust and shame as you ponder what went wrong in your life for you to end up watching another episode of this atrocity. 
Now, if you are really bored and still want to watch this show, all of the following leisure time activities will probably leave you more satisfied: 
+ Watching a good series instead 
+ Reading a book 
+ Laying in bed 
+ Staring at a brick wall 
+ Watching paint dry 
+ Repeatedly slamming your fingers with a door 
+ Doing literally anything else 
TLDR: 
If you want a comprehensive guide on how NOT to do writing, this has got you covered.

When I began this show I was ready to be amazed. I was ready to witness the inspiration for powerhouses like Code Geass and Death Note, the beautiful story of morality in politics. Instead I get this... convoluted mess. I was so set on enjoying this show that after every single episode I would make excuses for the show. Whether it was the episodic beginning of the show or the fact that there was literally no underlying story behind the show, I would constantly try to reason it away. But now, after finishing all -- episodes, I have nothing else to hope for except that the manga will be better. Lets do the categories. 
Story: - or - 
I want to give the story a - cause it didn't have one... but I went with a - to be fair. The first season starts off episodic and then each episode basically deals with its own event even after the show stops being so episodic. After a while, the characters start to work together but there is still no true story to the season. Which is absolutely stupid considering the girls are fighting terrorism. Hell, the RF in season - could have been the big ""boss"", but instead they just fall apart and you dont even know why. And thats not even a spoiler. Im not even kidding. Its such a waste of potential. 
Characters: - 
Despite giving this an -, its STILL a freaking let down. This show should have been a perfect --. I mean, you have your -/- fratella who each operate in their own way. Thats brilliant. And to some extent this part is done quite well. You get to see how the handlers cope with the stress of treating girls like tools. You get to see how the girls choose to think about their lives, how they mature, how they interact. My issue with this show is the complete lack of characterization for the terrorist groups (Outside of Pinocchio in season -). By making the welfare agency ""right"" in this conflict (Which is what happens when you dont show us the terrorist perspective) the show completely loses all nuance. Even the moral question of what the agency is doing to the girls loses nuance. Its a complete waste. 
There is nothing else I want to say honestly. I think this show suffers because it does not introduce the ""enemy"" perspective. Had it shown WHY the RF was fighting the government, WHY the RF wanted the bridge blown up, WHY the Pedonta existed and WHAT their goals were, this show would be a masterpiece to rival those that came after and before it. But it didnt, and instead we get this.

Code Geass is awesome. If you have any qualms against it, whether you dislike mecha or anything like that, put it aside and watch a few episodes. Then you'll see what I mean when I say that Code Geass is a great anime.   
If you want an anime that is going to leave you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, waiting impatiently for the next scene--this is for you.  
Art is pretty decent. It's very colourful. The animation is also good--the action sequences are well drawn.  
The characters are all interesting. Never have I seen an anime with a cast of so many anti-heroes before: lots of jerks, losers, obsessed freaks, and extremists, but they manage to make you intrigued with their lives and the happenings around them.  
The sound was also decent. A lot of trumpet and sweeping epic battle pieces that complement what happens on the screen.  
Code Geass is so original as well. It's about colonialism, if you caught it. It's like a cool History lesson--but with mechs. This is certainly one of the best anime to have been released this century.  
Watch it. It's totally fabulous.

""Kira Kira Pretty Cure Ala Mode"" it's the -- season of the franchise ""Pretty cure"" also now as ""Glitter Force"" outside of Japan.... 
This is called the worst season of the franchise ever made by the fans and... I don't now, i still thinking than ""Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure"" it's worse, but... That means than this is good? 
Not really, actually it's pretty bad. 
Characters: 
They are the same archetypes that the franchise has been reusing for several years ... Now, there would be no problem with the archetypes if they were to use them well, but these characters are painfully one-dimensional. 
The protagonist has an excess of time on the screen and never develops a true personality ... they only tell us how it feels more than showing them, simply a generic Precure protagonist. 
The other girls are there simply, their only excitement is that they must accompany the protagonist ... And also the fact of some forced drama they have at some point. 
Cure macaron and cure chocolate are simple copies of Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus and the villains are quite generic ... in the sense that everything they do, say or plan has already been seen many times in the franchise and anime in general 
Story: 
Similar to the characters, the plot is the same formula that the franchise has reused for years ... Now, they would not have a problem with it if they executed it correctly. 
But the problem is that they have no interest in telling us that formula in a way that could be remotely interesting ... They just want to tell it as quickly as they can, in order to generate toys that they can sell with it. 
It is pretty mediocre. 
Animation: 
The animation is normal, the designs are pretty moe, the colors are bright and flashy and the battle scenes are well choreographed. 
I also want to highlight the incredible CGI that the series has, La franqucia pretty cure has the best CGI I've seen in anime. 
Music: 
the music is passable, the songs are catchy and the voice acting very regular. 
There is not really a musical soundtrack and the few pieces that were there were quite generic. 
nothing special and forgettable 
I think if I had been -- years old I would have enjoyed this show more ... But I'm not a child and it made me painfully bored. 
but I think I would see it if I ever have children.

Don't expect more than light shounen-ai fluff out of this one -- you'll be disappointed. Story-wise, there isn't much to see here. The first few episodes are monster of the day type encounters that are supposed to give us some insight into the main characters (while simultaneously placing them in position to be slashed with each other.) The story picks up in the last two episodes, at which point it promptly ends without actually coming to a conclusion. The action is scant, and consists mainly of posed characters dashing across the screen making slashing attacks that do more damage to clothing than to anything else. That is, of course, when they bothered animating the action at all. In several instances the fighting takes place off screen, while the other characters comment on the battle. This ended up being very irritating; luckily, there's hardly any fighting that doesn't start and end in an energy blast after the second episode. 
The characters themselves, while terribly attractive, aren't anything special. They follow standard bishounen archetypes: Gou is the strong-willed, stoic leader, Shin the quiet, wise one (and he's got the spectacles to prove it,) Rei is bizarrely effeminate and sensitive, and young Gai is the head-strong, childish type. There isn't sufficient back-story to make any of the characters particularly sympathetic, and the attempts at placing them in relationships are weak and somewhat tawdry. ""One time he was nice to me!"" *blush*  
I wanted more out of this series, especially with such a great cast and an appealing premise (I get a kick out of angelic pretty boys,) but I was left unsatisfied. If you happen to have exhausted your supply of bishounen lovin' and need some RIGHT NOW, go ahead and give this a gander. Otherwise, move along. Nothing to see here.

Akagi is based around its titular character gambling his way to the top of the underworld, his enigmatic prowess for mahjong often turning the tide of certain defeat into victory. Akagi is a cold, relentless character. He cares little for money or for his own life. In the heat of the gamble he stops at nothing less than completely crushing his opponent's will to win... 
Akagi is the first Nobuyuki Fukumoto manga to get the anime treatment and the anime has been executed surprisingly well. It is with reason that I say, 'surprisingly'. When considering Fukumoto's original, while particulary famous in Japan and Korea, you can't help but think that it would be very difficult to animate it well enough to make it appeal to a wide audience.  
Firstly there is the subject matter, Akagi (the anime), as with a number of other works by Fukumoto, basically involves Akagi (the character) playing a couple of games of the Japanese version of mahjong, gambling for keeps. Next Madhouse have kept (thankfully) with Fukumoto's original art style, with all of its unconventional flourishes (read; big noses etc.). And finally, the lead character, Akagi, is not exactly the easiest character in the world to relate to. In short, he is out of this world, nothing short of a true &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;.  
With all of this in mind it is 'surprising' just how intense this anime is. In the next couple of paragraphs I'll try and breakdown how this anime overcomes all of the above, making it one of the most original, mind-numbingly insane animes in a long, long time.  
Firstly the mahjong. I have to admit that when I first started watching this anime I knew nothing about mahjong in general, let alone the Japanese version. The good news is that it doesn't really matter. The basic goal of the game and the rules are subtly explained as the anime progresses, and while it does help learn a bit about the different 'hands' everyone is going for it is definitely not a pre-requisite. You see, mahjong is game based on points so it is always pretty obvious who is in the lead, what kind of a hand Akagi needs to win the game etc. The finer points of mahjong all seem to come in to place as the games progress. The anime's direction involves a lot of internal dialogue. The audience is always privy to each characters' thoughts, allowing them to (conveniently) tell the viewer what kind of tile the character in question is waiting for, the number of points the hand they are going for will land them etc.  
Fear not, I can wholeheartedly say that the mahjong in this anime does not form an obstacle in the enjoyment of the anime in any way, shape or form. Like me, you'll probably get really into the game as you watch - The danger associated with having to throw away your tiles (with the possibility of the tile being picked up and used by your opponent as his victory tile) makes the game, and this anime truly absorbing to watch. 
The mahjong battles are awesome, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time, however the real reason that the mahjong battles draw the viewer in is the interaction between characters, or more specifically, the carefully constructed psychological battles that are played out before our eyes. 
The characters cannot be mentioned without some reference to the drawing style, which plays a large role in creating the tone of the series. As with anything Fukumoto, the character designs do take a little getting used to. Yes the characters do possess noses so large that Pinocchio would be put to shame. Yes the characters in general are kind of... angular. Yes there are no busty -D babes providing you -- year olds with fan service - Okay, deep breaths, deep breaths... If you watch this anime past the first episode you will (hopefully) realize that these features ARE NOT necessarily bad things. 
Firstly the originality really makes it stand out, and as you watch further into the series you begin to realize that the character designs do actually really suit the whole grim, macabre feel of the anime - hey, we're talking about a bunch of men gambling with more than money, with their very lives here -  it's not exactly The Brady Bunch... Trust me, by the time the anime ends you will think that the character design presented in Akagi is the ONLY true way you could represent the vile, ugly nature of underworld thugs. Personally, I love Fukumoto's ouevre. The characters are very expressive and the drawing style is perfectly combined with Hideki Taneuchi's brooding score to paint an intensely bleak pictue of the Japanese underworld circa the ----'s. I'm giving art and sound a --. 
Next, on to Akagi the character. He is a prodigy, an enigma - put bluntly, you are going to have a hard time understanding what he is going through. This is both a good and a bad thing. In a way his absoluteness, his superhuman insight wraps Akagi in a veil of mystery and, to paraphase the Fonz, is what gives him 'his cool'. On the other hand, when the anime ends you feel like you still don't really know anything about him at all. His existence in the anime is kind of like that of a mystery film. He reveals a little of his character, answering one question, only to pose two more...  
Now I like a piece of entertainment that doesn't completely reveal itself to the audience, making each and every one of us think for ourselves about the story's meaning, about what happens next. With Akagi however, this is taken to the extreme. The anime just kind of ends (mid-match). I know, that this is not really the fault of the animators as the original manga had still not ended its run. (At the time of writing the manga is up to -- volumes and is still ongoing -  the anime version of Akagi ends at the start of volume --). Having said that though I kind of wished that the animators would have veered from the original manga a bit towards the end, to give it a proper ending.  
For me personally it is such a shame that such an epic anime ends with not a bang, but a whimper, and it has a point taken off it for that... I hold out hope that there is a second season (it doesn't look likely though). 
While my review does end on kind of a sour note, let it be known that up until the ending this anime is pure gold, definitely a must see. If it is the mahjong or the character design holding you back, I urge you to give it a try - if you dismiss this one on face value you'll only be missing out on one of the most original, nail-bitingly intense anime series around. (No real biggie:)

I really enjoyed the first season of Gin no Saji. It goes w/out saying that I had really high expectations for the second season. And for the most part it didn't disappoint. 
Story/Characters: 
The story picks up where the last season left off where Hachiken is slowly getting used to the life at Yezo high. He's made friends and is now relatively enjoying his school life. But his character will develop by leaps and bounds by the end of this season w/c was why I liked it as much as I did. 
The character development... This aspect was really prominent this season and I enjoyed it a lot. Hachiken, Mikage and Komaba all have their moments and all of them felt really genuine and real. The drama also escalated quite a bit and if someone told me I'd cry because of dairy cows before watching this series I'd have thought them to be crazy. The story really upped the ante this season and it was great. 
Art/Sound: 
I personally thought the new OP/ED weren't as catchy as last seasons but that's just me. A-- remains consistent animation wise and still manages to give us really great backdrops. 
Overall: 
As much as I liked the last season I think season - trumped it by a fair margin. The story is moving along in really surprising ways and the roller coaster of emotions it takes you to is really enjoyable. Especially the last few eps. Hachiken and the gang are growing steadily and you feel all warm (but a little melancholic) inside seeing them go through all the things life throws at them. I'm pretty much up for a third season if ever. Another great SoL series to remember.

Cowboy Bebop fans will remember the fridge episode well; it was a filler episode whose events were not canon to the rest of the series, but it was a fun in-universe subplot playing out for what mostly seemed like Shinichirō Watanabe's enjoyment. Everything that went right and wrong with that episode in isolation is applicable to Space Dandy in general. 
Whereas Watanabe's other works like Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop more or less follow a consistent narrative (putting aside the occasional filler episode), Space Dandy is built more around a central, highly textured universe from which spring the individual, narratively isolated episodes. The worldbuilding in this regard is phenomenal, with imaginatively designed aliens and amusingly tongue-in-cheek organization and location names. 
This approach was a bit of a disappointment to me, since I got much more catharsis by the end of other Watanabe shows since there was growth and development of bonds between the characters. Further, some episodes were based on much shallower gimmicks than others or burnt out near the end with less than satisfying conclusions. 
Space Dandy has a lot going for it though; Dandy himself, along with the supporting cast, are all amusing and have good synergy. The Poverty Aesthetic also seen in Champloo and Bebop is present, making for a great baseline theme from which to spring comedy, unexpected noblesse oblige, and even the occasional heartstring tug. The visuals are an absolute feast and even have guest art styles for certain episodes. The voice acting is similarly bursting with personality and drama. 
Space Dandy is a great single-serving thrill kind of series. Sitting back and letting the experience wash over you is probably the best approach, perhaps with subsequent revisiting for when you get nostalgia for the kind of emotional kick a given episode has.

This is an OVA series about a young man who has to fight against an evil group bent on obtaining the hilt to an evil sword in order to take over the world. His father runs a swordmanship school, and when he hears the news he leaves on a journey to find a sacred sword that can battle against the evil one. That leaves his son in charge of the school, and also in charge of fighting against the bad guys. He's a little wimpy and naive; and is of course drooled over by several girls, but surprisngly he's a good fighter. This is a very abrupt OVA, like many others, and is rather silly and shallow at times but I found it entertaining overall.

Everything that makes Holo a beloved character is condensed into a -- minute window. Holo gets jealous, wasted, makes lots of cute faces, makes lots of sad faces, and mixes her immense wisdom with charming snark as is true to her personality.This is exactly what you look for in OVA content - a reminder of why we love characters and putting them into more intimate situations than in the regular anime. 
Even if you've never seen the regular anime, and especially if you have, this is a must watch. The complete collection blu ray contains both seasons and this OVA for ~-- somehow, a price so affordable you'd think Lawrence bargained for it.

When the old saying' ""Never judge a book by its cover"" is exercised, this is the first anime that comes to mind. Many anime fanatics would scorn the childish, ""girly"" atmosphere that Princess Tutu gives off initially, but I assure you that this show is anything but a fluffy Magical Girl anime. A gem among the piles of cotton and graphite which make up much of anime today, this show is not to be missed. Absolutely everything about Princess Tutu is brought to life in a brilliant combination of grace and aberrance. The character development was incredible in every aspect. As an actor and writer, I was drawn to how authentic the character's thoughts and emotions felt. Rue and Fakir's developments were especially conspicuous. I would also like to note Drosselmeyer's development. His subtle changes in behavior throughout the series added the crowning piece of sagacity that made this anime even MORE enjoyable! As for the soundtrack, I unambiguously adored the use of classical pieces. Having the music (and the specific dances) from various classic ballets was beautiful to watch. It was wonderful that the music and the storyline were interconnected in such a way that there would be a different ballet for each specific plot development. The storyline itself was rich in idiosyncrasy and creativity. Every plot twist was entirely unexpected, and it was terrific to have no idea what would come next. In all, this anime is OFF THE CHARTS! Try watching it, even if you don't have a particular love of Magical Girl anime. I guarantee it to be better than many would expect.

Zankyou no Terror is tragic. You can TELL what they were trying to do, it just… didn't work. I think it failed the same way Death Note did: it kept trying to --up itself until it went to far. In fact, it has a lot it common with Death Note - from the genre, to the overall story (government vs. criminal), to the fact that we're rooting for the for the ones doing the most harm. 
Five was somewhat pointless. It got to the point where it felt like she was only there to be filler, which is bad for a -- episode anime. 
I even have issues with Lisa. They kept saying she served no purpose - she even admitted it herself - but she never truly finds one. It would have been much better if she had admitted it, then found a purpose within the trio. But she never truly finds one. 
Zankyou no Terror had a lot of potential. But there are so many flaws that it falls on it’s face. Which is tragic, because the first few episodes are astounding and the soundtrack is flawless.  
I would recommend skipping this anime and watching Death Note instead. It did what Zankyou no Terror was trying to do - give you a suspense-filled psychotic thriller that leaves you guessing at every turn.

It's a shame there's a fetish for hentai like this. I never understood the appeal of a girl cheating on her loving boyfriend with some rapist.  The characters in this hentai are very annoying and unlikable.  Nobody ever thinks of calling the police after Miyu gets raped. Her boyfriend just looks at Terada angrily as if that makes anything better. At first you feel sorry for Miyu after her rape but then hate her once she begins to enjoy it. Standard hentai cliche but still. None of the characters really stand out except Terada who looks like Gendo Ikari. The music is forgettable and the art is only ok. Nobody is likable in any way so this hentai is just  one big fail.

I would rate this -- if I could! It's that bad, seriously!  
Basically, this is the anime equivalent of shock sites. 
If you hate someone or have an enemy, send them a youtube link to this OVA. (You're welcome ^^) 
Story: -- 
What story? It's an Incestual orgy between a bunch of deformed objects that are supposedly human? I don't even know! 
Animation: - 
The least disgusting thing about this. It's quite awful but it's still the best thing this OVA has to offer. 
Sound: - 
Some creepy guy telling a creepy story, sound effects are nauseating.  
Character: - 
Couldn't find any, there's no story to tell, therefore, there are no discernible characters. 
Enjoyment: -- 
Overall: -- 
Just avoid this like the plague that it is.

I'm going to preface this review by saying I am probably not the sort of person this anime was made for. In terms of the typical male-focused coming-of-age/first love stories, I'm probably pretty far from the demographic that it'll hit home for! 
It's a strange thing to compare it to, but the Disney-Pixar movie Brave likely had a similar effect on its audience - some people just lack the life experiences that make it easier to relate to the story and characters. 
STORY (-/--) 
Hyouka being a slice of life, it was never going to have a particularly complex story. Even so, I felt that the lack of consistent pacing and character development actively prevented me from fully enjoying the series. The story is by far the weakest aspect of Hyouka - it's not quite long enough as an anime to get away with dropping arcs significant to the main characters and coming back to them later, but it does this anyway. Pseudo-'filler' arcs all follow the same theme of Chitanda being impressed by Oreki, and Oreki becoming more interested in Chitanda, with the (not particularly interesting) mysteries serving as a means to that end. Chitanda is curious, Oreki tries to avoid her, Chitanda is a bit dense, Oreki is dragged into the mystery and solves it, Chitanda is impressed and maybe gets up close to his face, they both blush, Oreki is now more interested in Chitanda. The result is a story whose pieces are actually better enjoyed individually than as a whole. Pulling out the arcs with actual character development in them, watching those, and treating the fillers as OVA material might add to the enjoyment factor a little? 
ART (-/--) 
As ever, KyoAni knows how to make an absolutely gorgeous show. 
The character designs are simple but distinctive - little details like Chitanda's hair's unmistakeable rounded silhouette and Oreki's morning hair make them memorable. Even side characters benefit from this treatment! the attention to detail is fantastic, moments of relative quiet allow viewers to notice small accessories, fleeting expressions and background animation, and as ever KyoAni has the nostalgic, historic school setting down to a fine art. The second opening and Oreki's theories and daydreams are vividly animated, especially the moments depicting how he is captivated by Chitanda - those had me partially conviced that the series has elements of magical realism woven into it and that Chitanda does in fact wield a sort of bewitching power! 
SOUND (-/--) 
Wonderful music choices throughout, the Bach cello piece especially is used to great effect and helps give the series its nostalgic and somewhat magical feel. Actually, there's quite a bit of Bach in this series.. In terms of original soundtrack, the OPs also align really well with Oreki's character development, with the first being slow (almost lethargic) and the second along with its video tying in with some of those themes of Hyouka's mundanely magical atmosphere. The EDs are fun but a little less good, largely focusing on the girls pining over the guys, being adorable and looking into the camera with huge doe-eyes. 
Voice acting was good quality and fit the characters. All the voices were suitably expressive, though maybe not as distinctive as the characters' visual designs! 
Perhaps I'm being a little harsh in this section, but I weighted it towards the original soundtrack slightly and the OPs fitted so well with Oreki's character development that I was hoping for something better for the girls, or even anything for poor Fukube.. Regardless, a score of - is still really good, and subjectively I definitely go back and listen to the soundtrack sometimes! 
CHARACTER (-/--) 
Pretty much everything said in the story section applies here. A slice of life's story is only really as good as its handling of the characters, and Hyouka is a fairly weak in this area. the characters were actually likeable, though! the main flaws were in how they were handled throughout the story, and how at times they could become a little tropey. Fukube is pretty interesting and could use more screen time; Oreki is an albeit, more nuanced, look at the standard apathetic male protag; Ibara is a textbook tsundere childhood friend; Chitanda fits neatly into the manic pixie dream girl archetype and takes a good while to develop outside that. I did enjoy seeing Fukube, Oreki and Ibara go about their respective hobbies and excel at them, and I wish Chitanda had had more of her personal interests and hobbies depicted outside of just sort of.. Being Oreki's motivation. 
It's implied and stated throughout that's she's pretty book-smart but lacking in the life-smarts department, but the focus is largely on the cutesy-ditzy aspect of her which sort of makes her stand out a little less as a character for me. And her more serious moments exploring her devotion to her family nearer the end are fascinating and I'd have loved for more of the series to touch on that! 
ENJOYMENT (-/--) 
Eck, sorry Hyouka fans. This just didn't do it for me.. I think if I had picked out the specific episodes to watch that were suggested to me and ignored the others, I would've enjoyed it a lot more. As it is, this series took me literal years to finish because of how generic the fillers felt.. This section is always so so subjective though, so don't take this as an absolute 'I do not recommend this anime' 
OVERALL (-/--) 
While the visuals and the sound were stunning, Hyouka's stories and characters left me wanting more, in a bad way. The pacing really killed it for me. I think perhaps I'd feel differently towards this in movie format with some of the filler cut out, as I really enjoyed Garden of Words which is also beautiful but slow!

I was interested during the initial lure of the "" secret organisation"" and Teresa. By the end of e-- none of my questions are ever answered.  
Rocky is an absolutely frustrating and bland character, his only roles are to cower, wine, hug, and completely ruin every episode with his bs. 
How many times are we told once you revert there is no going back... uh huh... sureeeeee. 
How many times do we watch flash backs of a certain someones head flying through the air. 
How many times does Priscilla wine about her family.  
Guys this is like -+ times per episode each episode. The material is redundant. Even the scenes of someone going to the rescue repeat over and over.  
I've never seen an anime this bad in my life. It gets pretty bad about ----- episodes in. I'm not really sure which episode triggered me to start slitting my wrists, but it got to the point where I could predict what everyone would say, which cut scenes would be displayed, and when it was all done.. they couldn't even answer a single question about anything. 
Avoid this trash. No clue who would ever rate this an -. 
BTW all the Claymores are white, blond hair, silver eyes, and pretty much wear the exact same armor. Pay attention to their names or you will get lost in a sea of bland characters. By the end of it. 
Teresa is the only decent character in this series. I would watch it up to her part and then cut and run after.  
Seriously fuck this anime.

I don't mind simplistic comedy series. But if you are going to do that, at least make it little interesting. Put something at least slightly different. Make it funny... Anything... 
In my first attempt to watch this series, i only managed to bear - episodes and i just wanted to drop it instantly. This is my general routine on every series i watch.. I always watch the first two episodes and analize the sample. If i get bored of it, i simply drop it. But for the first time i thought, maybe i was being way too harsh with this procedure. 
I have no clue how did i make it through all that episodes. But i did it somehow. 
I was pretty much right. The biggest thing this gets from me is ""bleh"". You watch it, you waste your time for pretty much nothing. Characters are pretty much uninteresting, unoriginal and stereotypical; jokes are bunch of anime tropes, ""lol so random"" or/and just plain forced (harhar doggy stole mah bread, is it funny yet guys?). 
And yes it has a ""beach episode"" as well, what a surprise. So just another generic anime you'll forget few months later.

This show was surprisingly enjoyable. I'm no fan of shounen, and it is not a supreme masterpiece, but this anime manages to provide good comedy mixed with fighitng, and maintains good pacing throughout most of its episodes. Definitely recommended. 
Story: 
Good and fairly simple. Final conflict was a bit underwhelming, but the story mostly worked as a background for comedic plots and it worked for those purposes well. There's wide array of gags, running gags, etc. 
Art: 
Above average. Characters are a bit more detailed than what you'd usually see in anime with lower budget. There's barely any reused scene (i've spotted about two), characters are not cookie-cutter (visually). 
Sound: 
Decent music, solid voice work. I've recognized voices of Motoko Kusanagi (from GiS) and Yakumo Tsukamoto (School rumble).  
Characters: 
Characters are fairly stereotypical, but there's great deal of character development going on. Characters change over time, cheir personalities change as well, they grow stronger, etc. The interactions are mostly slapstic comedy (although it isn't very cliched on its own), but those interactions are amusing. Characters are memorable, for example, protagonists's sister was one of the most amusing ""little sister"" characters I saw. Protagonist steadily grows in strength and his character transforms along the way. 
Enjoyement: 
Near the end of the series where the series lost their momentumn and started stretching fights for too long. There weren't a lot of those, though. Overall I found it interesting to watch due to comedy element. 
Overall: 
It is -- episodes, but the quality of series is surprisingly good. It does occasionally have darker sadder moment, but it does not obsess over them, and is mostly on lighthearted side. There are better animes, of course, but there's not THAT many of them, and this anime works great when you need to relax/unwind.  
So, recommended.

Notes 
-I haven’t read the manga. 
-I watched the uncensored release of the anime. 
Terraformars, an anime about a bunch of genetically modified humans with animal powers that get sent to Mars to exterminate a race of hyper evolved humanoid cockroaches called Johj. Sounds radical, right? Unfortunately it isn’t and here i’ll explain why. 
Story:  
Really, there’s not a whole lot to talk about in terms of story. The entire plot is just an excuse to get the characters to Mars as quickly as possible and make them fight a whole lot and i suppose it does achieve that just fine. 
The main problem with the storytelling in Terraformars is the pacing.  
For a series that prides itself on being nothing but dumb action and violent fights, it’s actually painfully slow. We get shots that linger forever for no good reason, characters standing around doing and saying nothing for extended periods of time, tons of narrator delivered exposition and a ludicrous amount of flashbacks that sometimes take up the entire duration of an episode, while not really adding anything substantial. The best moments of the show are when it throws away any pretense of storytelling and just goes into full-on hot-blooded action-mode. Unfortunately these moments are rarer than you might assume and usually over quite quickly.  
Special shout-out to the shitty worldbuilding of this series.  
Terraformars is apparently set --- years in the future, yet aside from space travel, genetic manipulation and terraforming i guess, no technological advancements were made by the human race. The people back on earth still drive the same cars, dress in the same clothes and use the same fucking smartphones as we do today. Why even set the series this far in the future, if you’re not gonna use it for some interesting worldbuilding?  
The lightning fast evolution of the humanoid cockroaches is ridiculous anyway, may as well have set it fifty years in the future and not expose your complete lack of imagination.  
Oh yeah, there’s also some government conspiracy subplot, but no one cares. 
The series doesnt’t even have  any conclusion at all, it’s set up for a sequel  that will undoubtedly happen considering the popularity of it’s manga counterpart.  
Characters: 
The characters of Terraformars are about as boring and one dimensional as they come. The series utilizes constant long-ass flashbacks with sappy background stories to flesh out the characters, but it never works out, the characters remain uninteresting and all the flashbacks achieve is to kill any feeling of momentum this action series might have had.  
I shit you not, there’s one character whose entire backstory involves people in his life telling him what a boring person he is.  
However, this fleshing out only applies to a handful of the surprisingly large cast of Terraformars. The rest? Nameless cannon fodder that is absolutely and utterly useless and usually spend their time sitting around waiting to be killed.  
Also, holy fuck Terraformars, your only important German character is named Adolf, are you fucking shitting me? Would it have killed the writers to spend five seconds to google more appropriate German names? 
Sound:  
The OP is a generic fast paced buttrock track and it’s just kinda eh, but i can’t shake the feeling that it doesn’t really fit the series. I suppose i expected something a bit darker and more atmospheric.  
The ED i don‘t even really remember to be honest, the music of the series in general is fairly forgettable.  
As far as voice acting goes, it’s all fitting for the characters, but no one in the cast really delivers a standout performance.  
Visuals: 
The character designs are one of the few things in Terraformars i can praise. As someone who appreciates semi realistic human designs in anime, this stuff is right up my alleyway. The animal transformations of the humans also look pretty cool. 
The same thing can’t be said of the primary antagonists of the series, unfortunately. The designs of the humanoid cockroaches or Johj have gained some notoriety for being 'racist', as they look almost like caricatures of large muscular black guys. I looked into it and apparently they are based on the homo erectus and not black people.  
Looking at it that way, the design makes some sense, but is still not a great choice, as the Johj look silly and not particularly threatening. I feel like this is a wasted opportunity, the creators of the series could have created something truly horrifying, considering the creatures are based on fucking cockroaches of all things. The Johj could have been some serious nightmare fuel, instead they are silly cavemen.  
Animation in the series is fine when it counts, the fight scenes namely. It’s fairly consistent and the battles feel impactful, violent and on occasion even well choreographed. Too bad the color palette is so ugly, as all the colors in Terraformars look washed out and muddy.  
I suppose this was to give the series a darker and gritty look, but it ends up just being unappealing.  
There’s also this distracting noise filter that they kept using seemingly at random. What was the point of that? It just made the already so-so visuals of the series look shittier whenever it was active.  
Enjoyment: 
I’m not gonna lie, as much as i shit on this series, there were some pretty kickass moments hidden in there, namely  whenever the action was in full effect, but they are few and far between and get marred by all the problems plagueing this series. If nothing else, at least Terraformars is not particularly long and won’t waste a whole lot of your time. 
And this may sound unbelievable, but the educational value of Terraformars is actually surprisingly high (that is, more than nothing). You will pick up a lot of weird animal facts in this series, so there’s that.  
Overall: 
Terraformars is a series with a whole buttload of problems. Even if you are looking for a short, violent, action series, which is exactly what Terraformars is, there’s a lot of better stuff out there that you should check out instead. 
I give it a final rating of -/--. 
As always, please excuse any grammatical mistakes, as English is not my first language. And please feel free to leave me some feedback, i really want to improve.

Ah K-on!! 
I decided to watch this because I had seen the first season and thought I'd watch something I could bash on when it ended, because it's ended now, yes sure, there are two more episodes, but these are just extra helpings of moe for all you fanboys out there. 
At first it was everything I'd expected, it was moe, it was silly, nothing substantial about the anime whatsoever, neither storyboard nor any real screenplay, but then something happened, something that started to happen during the first season yet didn't fully evolve into this feeling I felt after having watched the second season; it grew on me. At this point in time good slice of life anime are a dying breed, atleast for people who aren't fanboys. Everything's been done, producers search desperately for new original ideas, but they're just not there and to tell you the truth K-on!! is not original in any sense, form or colour.  K-on!! shouldn't be good slice of life anime and for me it wasn't exactly good, but it was better than I had expected, it had an atmosphere of coziness, sure sometimes I wanted to smash something when it got excessively moe, but it was cozy, it was homely, the show offers something soothing and if that's what the producers wanted to give their viewers then they've done a pretty good job. 
I dislike KyoAni, but they can draw and animate, there is no doubt about it. As for the music, well props to the voice actors and producers for creating an OST it gives a sense of quality and whatever shortcomings K-on!! had, the feeling of quality is tangible. Much like a very, very neatly wrapped present with fancy paper and ribbons and hearts and bunnies and everything else cute you can imagine, yet the content of the present is rather empty. K-on!! will not blow your mind with an innovative storyboard and intriguing screenplay, but it will soothe you, depending on what kind of person you are and for what purpose you watch this show, in one way or another. 
To answer any and all questions or comments that come up after reading this review the correct answer would be; no.

No Game No Life is about a brother and sister, Sora and Shiro, when put together, are the best gamers in the world. One day, a boy by the name of Tet, who claims he is God, takes the two siblings to another world. In this alternate universe, there are -- races, including humans. However, the human kind in their world, can be considered the equivalent of ants in our world, because every race except for humans have some sort of special power, whether it might be magic, a sixth sense or extreme strength. In this world, humans are forced to the brink of extinction and our main characters take the role of not only saving humanity, but to also conquer all the other races that exist. 
Story [-/--] 
I wouldn’t say the story of No Game No Life is very unique, but it is definitely very entertaining to watch and compared to all other similar shows, it would be one of the best. The anime isn’t very deep but does provoke some thought as you will be trying to follow the logic and processing of two geniuses. There aren’t any key themes as the show is quite shallow and entertainment based. Overall, the story of No Game No Life is very enjoyable and will keep you hooked throughout all -- episodes. 
Art [-/--] 
When you think of No Game No Life, you think of its unique art style. The colours used in this anime are vibrant and warm. I really appreciated this as it differed greatly from the average anime art. However, after watching around - episodes, I got a slight headache and my eyes became quite sore as the colours are excessively bright. 
Sound [-/--] 
The opening and ending songs of this anime are average, nothing worth mentioning. After finishing the show, I never bothered to search it up again to listen to. Music inside the episodes are fitting but also did not stand out much. The two main voice actors, however, did exceptionally well, especially Shiro’s, who was done by Kayano Ai. The voice was very suitable and a perfect match for her character. 
Character [-/--] 
Although unrealistic, most of the characters in No Game No Life are easily lovable. As for character development, I wouldn’t say there was too much of this on our two main characters but more on Stephanie Dora, a semi-main character. This being said, we still learn a fair share about Sora and Shiro’s backgrounds but nothing about the rest of their family. The two characters also do not fail to surprise their audience and continue to exceed expectations throughout the entire series. The supporting characters are also very unique as there are -- races and each and every one of these differentiate greatly. Even within the races, characters seemed to have their own special characteristics and traits. 
Enjoyment [-/--] 
Overall [-/--] 
To be completely honest, I didn’t realise how much I actually enjoyed this anime until a couple weeks after finishing it. At the time, I was pretty distracted from the previous anime that I watched before No Game No Life, but now looking back, I really liked this series and am looking forward to a second season of this awesome show!

I am a rabid fan of anything relating to Tsubasa Chronicle, so I naturally picked up this movie. In this review, I will treat this movie as a side story arc within the Tsubasa Chronicle franchise.  
Story: - 
Whoever decided that -- minutes was enough time for a typical Tsubasa Chronicle arc needs to be fired. You will hard pressed to find another story so rushed and choppy in anime. The scenes were extremely short, the story moved light-speed fast, and there were huge informational gaps between scenes. One particular scene transition that comes to mind is one scene involved the characters forming a plan and then the very next scene the environment and circumstances had changed, a decent amount of time had passed, and what happened during that time was quickly brushed over with hurried dialogue. It was like watching the preparations for a battle and then skipping over the fight scene to the outcome. A better analogue would be that this movie was originally a - hour feature film that was edited down to -- minutes, so only flashing visual pictures of plot points were shown. The only reason why I gave this story even a - is that the concepts themselves weren't irritating or originally atrocious.   
Art: - 
For a ---- anime movie, the art is quite good. It stays true to the rest of the earlier Tsubasa Chronicle franchise. 
Sound: - 
The same OST from the series is used in the movie, so it is excellent. Gorgeous could not be a better word to describe this OST. However, the --/-- OST is compromised by ill-timing. Songs were either played during inappropriate scenes or choppily edited.  
Character: - 
I tried to view the characters independently from the series. Since the characters were slaves to the rushed plot and not allowed to display their typically strong personalities and character development, they came off rather bland. The new characters especially suffered from this, but they were rather uninteresting to begin with. 
Enjoyment: - 
Everything was moving so fast and with so little explanation that I found very little enjoyment in this movie. I felt like I was watching the Tsubasa Chronicle characters perform an improvised skit while casually listening to its phenomenal soundtrack. 
Overall: - 
One of the worst cases of storytelling that I've ever seen. At least it was Tsubasa Chronicles so it had good art and music, but the shadow characters and atrocious storytelling made it barely watchable.

Inou battle tries to blend the chuuni over-the-top comedy with the teenage drama commonly found in series like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Do not be fooled by its title. While the series is named ""Supernatural battles within daily life"", the ""Nichijou"" part is far more prevalent than the ""Inou battle"" part, and what little plot or action concerning their powers there is gets confined to the very last episodes (and left with no closure) and its presence and relevance is marginal at best. 
The ""nichijou"" part is not too succesful either, as the transitions from comedy to drama sections are often abrupt and do not fit the general tone of the series well. The fact that everyone is in love with the MC is eyebrow raising as well because they hardly show why the female cast develops feelings, and therefore all the romance and drama arising from it is not as effective as it should be. While the series would have benefited from a stronger comedy section, it's still generic enough to be enjoyable if you don't mind the style in the first place but it is no more than filler between better series.

It is often said that bland protagonists are used to be a self insert for the viewer so that they in some way may get enjoyment from the power fantasy the protagonist embarks upon. 
Isekai was Smartphone to Tomo ni fails hard in this regard because it is too boring to experience that one thing. 
This anime is your typical 'in a new world' show crossed with your typical harem. I'll be the first person to say I normally get some enjoyment in that particular genre, so keep that in mind as you read on. 
We start out with out main protagonist (Who is so forgettable I've forgotten his name after watching several episodes) dying due to a mistake by God and reacting with all the impact of a gentle breeze. To make up for this, God apologizes by reincarnating him in a generic fantasy world with, as you can guess, his smartphone. 
Within -- minutes after first touching down to the ground of this new world in runtime, our protagonist saves as I refer to them as 'Girl A', and 'Clone of Girl A' from some thugs with some ultra slick slow mo one punch action, is sitting on a PILE of money after selling his clothes, just so HAPPENS to staying at the same place as the two girls and just HAPPENS to be able to harness every single element of magic in the world including all the kinds that are impossible. 
I've read bad fanfiction with less broken Mary-Sue main characters, and this is just all from the FIRST EPISODE. 
Overall, the animation is underwhelming, the characters are flat and lifeless with little depth beyond their tropes. The world is as generic as a $- McDonalds cheeseburger, and I salute any who can last more than four episodes.

The Zodiacs, a Chinese representation of animal sign for every year that gives ones luck, personalty and out look and next year ---- would be the year of the Dog and it's gonna kill us by biting, Woof, Woof! Ok, so in a city of  half a million people somewhere in China (trust me such ghost city does exist) all been removed to give way to the --th Zodiac Tournament which takes place every -- years.  Where -- of the deadliest mercenary warriors (at least that's what it says) with the names and attributes of the -- Chinese zodiac animals are pitted against each other, the prize, one wish that could change their lives...or at least that's the plot..............but....................: 
Good -, Story: Killing me softly  
..........That's not the whole case in this anime, good as it is since it was suppose to be a survival of the fittest, for a while it did deliver some sort of excitement of seeing them duke out with each other, that's the good part, but when one realizes as to how the characters die one by one, one would get the sense that the winner was already decided from the start. Now don't get me wrong , it has a good plot at least in paper, but as it goes on, the fighting and how the character dies becomes less of a priority and the focus was on the backstories of the characters, in a way it does provide some touching moment about some of the characters like Niwa Tori's and Kanae Aira's backstory, where you'll sympathize with them as to the horrors that they have undergone, but all that get's wash down as how evil they become. It's like giving you something nice only to be shock of the strings attached.   
Poor -, Art: Killing by Disgust 
There goes them Japaneses' over-elaborate sense of crime of fashion, the character illustration were everything were just too ill-fitted, so let's go over them: 
Toshiko Inō/Boar- In the start of the tournament we see her dressed for success , so why the heck was she wearing an office attire when she could have wore her outfit when she's killing some mrecs at the start of the first episode? 
Michio Tsukui/Dog- Was he suppose to look like a dog or a werewolf? Cu'z his outfit was just too shabby to even be a hitman, he basically can pass as an mountain man who would kill anybody who stray in his territory. 
Ryōka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- So, as a chicken , what's up with that pitch fork that she never get;s to used?????Also, she's suppose to look like a chicken and not a club stripper who dresses up like a parrot. Also, the character should have been a man not some chicken shit girl who kills deceptively.   
Misaki Yūki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a mix of someone who is suppose to go hiking because of her backpack, green fatigue jacket  and hiking shoes and someone who is going to an  AKB--  audition  with her zettai ryoki, head phone and bloomers, also her tied down hair and glasses add's to her dorkyness.  
Sumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- They should have use the younger version of him, his outfit makes him look like someone who should be in the ----'s era in Japan. 
Yoshimi Sōma/Horse- All that muscle and meat should belong to the Bull. 
Takeyasu Tsumita/Snake- Well he's dressed for the occasion, I give him that, but he should be handling a freeze gun and not a flame thrower. 
Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon- All white, seriously?????Also he ought be carry a flame thrower and not Capt Cold's freeze gun.  
Usagi/Rabbit- Face-palm, major crime of fashion, he's like a gay stripper with that big puffy tail , rabbit ears and high heels. 
Kanae Aira/Tiger- Ok, so were there any beaches or a pool party going on around the setting that she has to be in a bikini????? Major face-palm, major not dressed for the occasion............ though she does look hot in it. It would have been better if she opted for her Karate Gi than that bikini.  
Eiji Kashii/Ox- Long hair, slim body, GAAAAAAYYYYYYYY, also that matador outfit????Sheees, he should be in the Bull Ring duking it with a wild bull, also he should have been the one to have the horse's meat and muscle and use his strrups as his killing weapon and not that Calvary saber.   
Tsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat- His attire makes him look like a member of the Power Rangers, which is too dorky and his hair was just too disgusting that he needs to see a hair stylist. 
Duedeculpe- Is there a circus around here, cu'z that where he should be? Or maybe he's pimp, either way he's a major crime of fashion. 
I really don't understand why in their back stories them characters were dressed for that occasion and not in this occasion . 
Good -, Sound: Killing me with joy 
The score was for the opening and closing theme, cu's it suited that anime well, and that's that. 
Poor -, Characters: Killing the chef 
Ok, so, I did mention something about being misplaced, also there is big plot hole as to how they got there special abilities which makes us wonder as how they got it in the first place  , so let's discuss each of them: 
Duedeculpe- The moderator of the Juuni taisen/ Wish granter who has the ability to grant any wish for the victor, so is he a man with influence or a demon? That is the question,given that he can grant such wish like magic and at the same time works like a mafia boss who makes money on the competition. 
Tsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat-  He's the Killing All or Killing by Swarm or wtf kind of killing method he does, but the fact is he hardly kill anyone at all , the death of Ox was with consent and with his ""Hundred Paths"" shit kinda make him a cheater, which is the only way he won, but in the end the wish he choose was to forget the tournament was just too lame . Also him being the obvious winner serves as one reason for my score. 
Eiji Kashii/Ox-The Killing Systematically guy, does he do that, cu's it doesn't look that way, cu'z he doesn't show any interest in joining the monkey's peace proposal, also, at the first couple of episode we see him just stab and slash anyone he sees , so where is the systematically there? Looks more like he's killing randomly, his killing should have gone to the rabbit cu'z he is the one who kills systematically. 
Kanae Aira/Tiger- The Killing in a Drunken Rage kind of a girl, she started as a High School girl who is into martial arts who becomes crazy and drowns her sorrow with allota alcohol, so her being this Killing in a Drunken Rage, is not enough to describe her as a whole, she should have been the Killing Psychotically While in a Drunken Rage one ,cu'z in her backstory we did see her running amuck while killing were she see herself no longer a human but an animal and that is where the psychotically part belongs. 
Usagi/Rabbit-The psychotic homo, ok so he's the Killing Psychotically guy, but let's not forget even psycho kills systematically so he should have been the Killing Systematically guy and not the Ox. 
Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon and Takeyasu Tsumita/Snake- They are like oil and water that original creator Nisio Isin tries to mix, ok so they both Kill for Money, but they both have a double standard in fact they are a double standard in everyway , they love money and yet we see them threw it away, they're both part of some cult that has different views and worshiped different patron deity  and yet they function as criminal organization. So basically each twin can be any side of the coin, which is why for them to the Killing For Money twins doesn't suit them, Killing Deceptively is what they should be since they're very deceptive not only to others but to each other as well, as seen when the snake get to be killed by the Rabbit the dragon doesn't seem to mind, in fact he even feels relived to see his twin bro dead. also, it was unfair that the snake has to die first, his role should have been utilize further since he has to be the -th person to die. 
Yoshimi Sōma/Horse- So the man who is the Killing Silently is a pussy, disappointing that he has already lost his nerve the moment he encounters the Ox. Shit, all that muscle and speed , not to mention all the things he has undergone to have all that ability only went to waste. Killing His Time , is what he should be. 
Sumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- This Killing Deceptively old man, shouldn't even be in the tournament , unless the Original Creator uses a younger version of him. His Killing Deceptively doesn't quite make him , since he was more if a bomb and trap  guy,  so Killing Silently should have been his title, also his Killing Deceptively isn't limited to him, cu'z even the boar, chicken and them twins also kill deceptively.  
Misaki Yūki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a pacifist and a peace maker who prefers to Kill Peacefully, frankly her character was an oxymoron, cu'z how can she have such title as Killing Peacefully when she hates to see people dying, also, why would she be a merc when it's very obvious that she specializes in negotiations rather than warfare, she prefer to use her kung fu skills than with a weapon such as a gun or a knife.... Frankly the best way to describe her character in general was that she is like a knife in a gunfight or a dove in a flock of raptors, so really she should have the title Killing by Nagging. Also, the part where we see her setting explosive should have been done by the Sheep since he like things that goes BOOM. 
Ryōka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- Her Killing by Pecking was just sooooo lame , he should have had the rat's Killing All , since she, like them twins, was also as deceptive as them, as seen in her backstory and as we see she does kill all even her own side.  
Michio Tsukui/Dog- As much as I hate to say it , his Killing by Biting suit him well, since dogs do carry rabies. 
Toshiko Inō/Boar- For her to be this Killing Bounty fully is an understatement, since she has the ability to convince somebody to kill for her ,so she should have been the Killing by Mongering, since she did used some kind of hypnosis to make her sister kill everyone she knows, then again too bad she's the first to die, if we can call it that. 
Good -, Enjoyment: Killing by excitement 
It was exciting when you haven't figure out the order of death, which is good, but as you find out the order, you'll be a bit disgusted , since the one you expect to put up a good fight didn't happen, the one we expect to win didn't happen cu'z there is reverse order of death, soooooooo.... 
Poor -, Overall: Everybody Clap Your Hands 
..........Was poorly executed, too predictable, and a plothole as to how those contestant got such ability were never mentioned.......season -???????? Maybe.

APFU used instead of full title. 
APFU is a unique show. One that stands out from the crowd during a crowed --------- year of excellent shows. APFU is done by studio Madhouse. Madhouse is well known for a special kind of visual presentation, characters over a more realistic background. That style is found here as well. 
The basic synopsis is that four girls around age -- travel to Antarctica. Personally, I thought this show would be a cheesy slice of life cute girl show that blended into the background. The premise of Antarctica did not appeal to me on any level. I've seen plenty of David Attenborough documentaries and felt I already knew enough about the continent. Combining these factors, APFU was far down on my watch-list. It could be said it wasn't on my list at all. To be very honest, after seeing the poster and reading the synopsis, I made APFU the butt of some of my jokes. Using it analogously to bash other boring cookie cutter slice of life shows. Turns out, I was wrong.  
I'd like to start my review talking about the visual aspect. Madhouse's style has honestly never had a home like this one. I've tried to imagine this show done by other studios and I have a hard time imagining anyone else doing this correctly. It's not a far reach to say this is artistic. The portrayal of Antarctica really stands out. The sky and landscape is incredibly beautiful. It's easy to think they could have given us basic white backgrounds throughout but instead they made the landscape feel special, without portraying it as unrealistic. The backgrounds are most beautiful during certain key scenes, and they build up to that background without suddenly having a major change. They seamlessly transition in and don't distract from the moment. The character artwork is also special for a “cute girls” show. They aren't made to be especially cute or beautiful. The hairstyles are especially different from the mainstream. They are borderline unattractive. This makes the characters feel much more like real people instead of idealistic teenagers. It is easy to know who is who without pink or blue hair. The only issue I ever had was precisely picking out who was who when they were in full arctic face-masks. Usually this was only for a brief moment before context was given to who was who. Overall, the show gave of an almost movie like vibe in the visual department. Undeniable quality, absolute excellence.  
Moving into the sound department, I wasn't ever particularly impressed with the opening or ending music. This really was one of the only areas I can imagine being improved on. Things take a drastic Tokyo Drift style turn when going into the sound track of the episodes. Effect quality is excellent. It's realistic and not distracting. The voice actors (sub) do an amazing job letting their words carry the weight of their emotions. It's not worth spending time on these these two aspects as they completely accomplish their goal. They don't take away from the viewer's sense of belief or immersion. The highlight of this anime's sound is the musical sound track played during the episodes. A great utilization of silence helps add weight when needed, and the music balances perfectly to not overshadow anything key. The most stand out piece is played during “the moment”. It plays through the credits and gains prominence over the scene and absolutely pushes “the moment” to the peak climax. The play in, the volumes, and the piece itself embarrass other soundtracks throughout all of anime. Credit to the director and other producers for absolutely hitting a home run in “the moment”. If I have any issue with it, it's that is overshadows a lot of other pieces used in this show. 
“The moment” I've referenced will be covered in this portion of the review, the story. It's made obvious by the Visuals and the OP that the girls will be adventuring to Antarctica. However, even if it sounds cliche, this story is about the journey, not the destination. The story goes to show that this isn't a casual trip you buy a ticket for. It is an absolutely epic journey with mind boggling logistics and challenges. This gave me almost a feeling of personal regret, or a sense of missing out. The girls are not particularly strong or experienced, but are able to manage this incredible feat. While I am no expert in the art of Antarctic exploration, I feel it gave an amazing and realistic version of what it is to journey to somewhere as remote and demanding as Antarctica. Each of the four girls also had a unique reason for taking the journey. Each reason resonates and grows clearer as the show progresses. The ideas are not forced out with no reason. They appear straightforward enough but become exponentially more complex and emotional as the series progresses. Some of these ideals are incredibly relatable to most viewers, while some are more obscure. The reasons that are less relatable are key to the series as it helps the audience to understand the actions taken by people that are often misunderstood. APFU takes on some more complex motives through these less common situations. One of the characters motives is more prominent than the others. APFU takes this motive throughout the story to build to “the moment”. What makes it exceptional is it's build up. Normally an anime wants to deliver it's feels and thrills the same way a jet fuel drag car takes off. They press the pedal to the floor and keep it there delivering the package instantly. Shows like Attack on Titan use that method often. Shock factor. APFU is more like a Bugatti slowly setting off on a salt flats speed run. Quiet and comfortable all the way to top speed, where the realization of ---+mph sets in. Every piece beforehand is meticulously crafted to leave just enough mystery. The show does an excellent job not foreshadowing exactly what “the moment” will be, while letting the audience know it's coming. “The moment” itself is special in it's delivery. It brings an unparalleled realism to an emotional moment. The scene is not overly drawn out, in fact lasting only a couple of moments. As a viewer I keep thinking I had reached the moment during the episode just to find it was the final few “mph” before top speed. Once we are finally met with it, it's one of the most choking and emotional scenes in anime. As good as or better than Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Your Lie in April, at delivering the feel to the viewer. This moment is one that left me froze in place with a strange sensation and truthfully, even at this point I want prepared for something done so well. “The moment” was made possible also in part thanks to incredibly well handled pacing. -- episodes was the perfect amount, and there were no major slowdowns. Everything was 'just enough’. 
Overall this anime is almost a -- in my book. It's nothing short of a masterpiece. In my opinion, it's universally applicable. Something I'd recommend for fans of any anime. I can even see this as an anime I would recommend to someone not familiar with anime at all. I'll revisit this review in the future before and after a re-watch, but I can foresee myself scoring it the same. Considering this was a show I didn't think I would enjoy at all, I'm admitting I was wrong. A case of judging a book by the cover. A Place Farther than the Universe is a must see.

school days is a very intersting anime, its full of drama and romance. but beware if you diced to watch it the end is a very big twist, the end also is very disturbing. I dont think this was a very good anime but it did have some twist in it where i was just like, OMG. i think if you watch it you will think the same thing. 
The male lead charter is basicly a sexactied and very selfish.  I personal hate him the way he treats girls the way he acts the way he is i hate it. Im glad of what became of him but i would never have done that i was very disturbed i almost shut off the computer but its just a show not real.  
The other two girls are very wired also they should just have moved on. but no they had to have that one dush bag. But its hard to move on sometimes (my own exprience).

I went into this show pretty new to anime, so I had my expectations low, this show couldn't meet one of them. The show started off slow paced, it focused more on character development between Izumiko and Miyuki, which really helped develop their relationship, but after that there really wasn't much time for the plot. 
In the end Miyuki is the only character to get true character development, going from a jerk to a decent guy, if RDG did anything right it's Miyuki, but that's where the good part ends. 
**********SPOILERS********** 
As I said the plot progresses slow, leaving the ending incomplete with a scene in the theme song the never happened(Miyuki and Izumiko's kiss) and a plot line left unsolved(Mayura and Miyuki's ""marriage arrangement""). 
When I saw the first episode, even when I read the description, it intrigued me. The plot goes nowhere. The middle is hard to understand, choppy even. Things happening with little to no reasoning. Leaving things unexplained such as how Izumiko got her powers and why she can't touch electricity. 
Izumiko's personality isn't very clear. In the beginning she's sweet, but at certain times near the end she becomes mean towards Miyuki for random reasons such as going on a 'date' with her goddess self and other things. 
Izumiko's half goddess thing is also overlooked, the anime itself looks like a slice of life anime. RDG goes more into culture than they do the backstory. 
If you like slow moving plots that go nowhere this anime is for you!

For all of it's interesting character designs and potential, Zvezda can't seem to translate it into something watchable. The premise is an immediate attention grabber, a comedic story about a organization out for world domination from the perspective of one of it's low level grunts. Unfortunately A-- seem to have stopped at the premise and character designs, forgoing writing an interesting narrative.  
On several occasions I was left with the feeling that I'd missed an episode or two, plot points are introduced and dropped fast with little explanation. Some story beats completely miss the mark, and the level of narrative convenience on display is unmatched by any piece of media I've ever watched. Things happen in Bouryaku no Zvezda which is the nicest thing you can say about it's plot, but it's unlikely to explain why. 
There is little to no consequence to anything that happens during these -- episodes. Many of the characters do not get their time in the sun, instead the show assumes that we know them already by introducing characters from their past and forcing us to fill in the blanks. In one particularly insulting instance, the climatic episode of the series is a hot spring episode. The characters return from their vacation to discover that the final act of the story has started without them present. Why? 
Of course the character designs are interesting, but you'll be given very little reason to care about many of them. It's impressive that in a show with such an out-there cast they still find time to have anime requisite filler in a -- episode show. What's the opposite of ""tightly paced?"" Zvezda is exactly that. 
The animation is fine enough, and the voice acting and soundtrack is a particular highlight for me. But otherwise this is a show with very, very little to offer the viewer. In fact it doesn't seem to have much to offer to itself. With a bit of effort with it's narrative this might have been a highlight of the season, instead it's easily forgettable and in some cases obnoxious to remember. 
Zvezda isn't interested enough to have a coherent story, return the favour and avoid this one.

Excessive violence can be useful in many ways. In Hellsing’s case, the violence shows us the worst side of Humanity by inverting the roles of the supposed “Good Guys” with the “Monsters”. In other words, it insists heavily on fanaticism to prove a point: to show us that humans can be worse than real monsters. Now the question is: Does it succeed?  
It tries to, but in a pretty ridicule and pathetic way that it becomes more of a mockery than a message or a lesson.  
The story is tedious and looks like any Vampires Vs Church or Zombies mashup movie. It is filled with made up historical facts but it doesn't matter since the writer cleverly uses distractions such as introducing a new character every episode as well as prolonging the action scenes more than they deserve. 
The characters are blunt and can only be described as pretentious. They are all badasses who wear shiny white glasses to cover their eyes so things can get easier to animate. They look the same, behave the same and speak the same garbage nonsense for up to - whole minutes to waste our time. However, we do have one exception: Alcurad a.k.a Dracula a.k.a The Almighty Invincible Vampire of All Times who can’t be killed even if you tore him to pieces or cut off his head. Consequently, the action becomes very predicable so you’ll be left out rooting for the enemy instead, hoping for Alcurad to STAY dead this time. But nope. He can’t feel pain, can’t get hurt, and is impossible to kill. And it’s not because he’s a vampire (Even vampires can be injured or killed in the show, but not him). It’s because the writer said so. He’s a necessary plot device who obeys any order or request Integra (a.k.a the writer) gives him with a simple nod of “Yes, MY MASTER” (i.e “Yes, MY WRITER”) without even questioning it.  
There is a scene where he becomes a brainless namby-pamby who can’t act on his own since he prefers sitting in the basement doing absolutely nothing and waiting for the intruders to massacre everyone in his mansion. He’s so strong yet doesn’t feel like helping his people. Instead, he sits on his chair, smirks while waiting a good -- minutes for a strong opponent to finally show up. Then he acts as if he’s completely powerless and gets chopped off, only to turn into a nightmarish creature and kill whoever was in front of him.  
What makes the show pathetic is the fact that he could have prevented the death of thousands of people simply by transforming into this deadly monster in the first place. This way he could have defended the mansion in a matter of seconds before coming back to defeat the opponent who conveniently showed up at the last minute. But we had to see him act irrationally for the sake of forcing the violence. Otherwise we won’t witness the unnecessary gore upstairs, right? Otherwise, the show won’t look good.  
I’m not joking about this. This literally happens every single episode! Smiling Alcurad stays immobile and intentionally waits to get shot multiple times for hours until he finally decides to strike back. So if you have a problem with a flamboyant and over powered main character, now’s your chance to drop the show. 
And what makes it even more frustrating is the scene where Alcurad slaughters thousands of innocent police officers who were just doing their job instead of simply escaping the building. He can’t die, right? So where’s the harm in trying to make a run for it?  
I won’t waste any more time spoiling with more examples. This is what Hellsing is about. Violence for the sake of violence. Nothing more, nothing less. 
Regarding the female lead Seras Victoriais, she’s a half-written supporting character who plays zero role in the story. I’m not exaggerating. Alcurad doesn’t even need her help since he can single-handedly wipe out thousands of enemies in a blink of an eye. Even her messed up back story was rushed and resolved very quickly for some unknown reason. 
The villains are also boring and consist of a fanatic priest, ghouls, and a Hitler-wannabe who kills people simply because he “Loves war”.  
The serious tone of the show is ruined by the excessive use of “funny scenes” to lessen the tension. There’s even a scene when Alcurad meets his archival again and things are about to get serious but suddenly Seras steps in to break the mood, leading a bunch of old people into what seemed to me like a concrete wall. Play that scene again if you don’t believe me.  
Even though it takes itself too seriously, Hellsing prefers using random sketchy and goofy animations to make us laugh and forget about the dark side of it. This seems absurd since it goes to such great lengths to look dark and mature. And I’m not just talking about the excessive gore. I’m also talking about how the show proudly uses themes of rape and necrophilia, but how can we take it seriously if it constantly tries its best to make us forget about it, as if those elements are nothing serious to begin with? 
Sadly, Hellsing stays monochromatic and fails to deliver its message. There is no contrast between good and evil. They are all portrayed as evil. You just have to pick a side, most likely the one that looks better than the other. 
At the end of the day, Hellsing is a horror shonen-ish anime that does what it does best: impress us. The action can get pretty long but still keep you entertained. However, the characters are worth forgetting since they don’t even try to engage in the story. Their only concern is to show off so they can look good no matter what, but in reality they can all be reduced to a single character. That’s how homogenous they are. And the worst part is that they constantly use empty talk to stall for time so they can gain some sort of an advantage over the enemy which is ridiculous. So once again, if this isn’t your thing, stay away from this show.  
Nonetheless, Hellsing still deserves a shout out for the amazing art and animation it has. It looks good, too good that you won’t even notice what’s wrong with it. So giving it an overall score of -/-- seems like the least I can do.  
Me: “So next time, what do you do when you’re in a Life or Death situation?” 
Integra: “It’s easy. Play it cool. Smoke a cigarette and stall for time while waiting for your backup to arrive.”

I'm not good with reviews but as NGE is my favorite anime I will try and explain why I think it's a masterpiece. Of course it will have a little bit of spoilers but I will try to not give huge ones.  
First of all what is Neon Genesis about? It's presented as just another mecha anime but actually the ""mechas"" and fights aren't important to the series, the focus are the characters, their feelings and how they react what's going on, and how can you learn with them.  
Story: Well written but a little confusing, a lot of things aren't explanned but this is how things should be, you can give your own interpretation of what's going on.  
Art: Outstanding. Not just the animation or how they mix advanced tecnology with real world elements, what makes it perfect is how they trigger emotions on the watcher. - things that are used often are the frozen images that builds tention to the next scene and the images flashes that makes us anxious and try to recap what we just saw.  
Sound: The OST is by far my favorite in all anime. All of the soundtracks fit perfect where they should, giving us the right emotions in the right time.  
Characters: This is for me what makes NGE so special. Every single character is well developed and you can explore them deeply and understand them. Also, almost all of them can be related with real persons and not just characters. This happens because Hideaki Anno (the author) putted a little of himself in each one of them. If you analyse the whole story by one character point of view you will have different interpretation of the same story, this makes it more real, different people have different interpretation of what happens around itself.  
Enjoyment: Well, this topic is very personal, each person have different tastes and will enjoy different. I loved it because how I could put myself in the sorty and take things of it to my own life.  
Conclusion: I could talk for hours why I love NGE, but I just think everyone have different opinions and what makes me love it maybe you dislike it or didn't even cared about it. Evangelion is a masterpiece because how diferent people fell about it. This is what art is about, an author put their emotions and interpretation on it but each person will have a different one, and don't matter what they will say, the important is what you think about it.  
I think everyone can learn with NGE, everyone can take something from it to it's own life and have different feelings watching. That's why I think it's very personal anime and different people can have completly different opinion and interpretations about it and having a story that don't give you all the answers for everything helps to build those interpretations. For me NGE it's a life lession that says to you that even with problems life can be enjoyable for everyone, you just need to find your place in this world and not run away from it, reality can be thought but it's better than scapng from it.

When I first started Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda, I initially dismissed its mediocrity and by the numbers plot for yet another angsty teenage romance, but upon further evaluation, I discovered that Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda does something very special, something very rarely seen or heck, even discussed in anime. 
What I'm referring to of course is the depiction and commentary on the issue of mental health in teenagers in Japan. Tragically, in reality, most cases are simply dismissed or ignored; the social stigma for someone suffering from a mental disorder is especially daunting and uninviting. What does this have to do with the anime you ask? This theme is mostly conveyed through the primary heroine, Naruse, in this anime. Without spoiling much, some family complications leave her in a state of despair and she suffers through a mental sickness that left her hallucinating and unwilling to speak, for her mind will render a stomach ache if she does.  
Now this is where the anime starts really taking off on its harsh and brutal social commentary, instead of seeking outside help or advice from, say, a medical professional, she instead decides to be a complete shut in for several years of her life. Adding to the fact that neither her mother or other classmates notice this until her uncaring teacher arbitrarily decides to group her and the main characters into a Community Outreach performance, reflects the reality in which how uncaring most outside people are to people suffering from some form of mental disorder. In fact, earlier on, her ostracization from her fellow classmates as well as the accompanying isolation is especially cruel.  
The other major characters also provide a gateway for meaningful commentary, courtesy of the writer, to the audience. Most of it is especially cynical and a criticism of perhaps, modern society in Japan. Takumi for instance, is a reflection of how stubbornness can be mistaken for determination. His stubborn insistence for Naruse's involvement in the project as well as his refusal of taking her medical condition seriously is often mistaken for genuine determination by the rest of the cast. I believe this reflects well on our society's cultural norms. And then there's Natsuki, who while at first glance may seem to be the typically cliched girl who met protag-kun before earlier in life but never fessed up to him and never bothers properly confessing or telling him or at least hanging out with him or some logical thing, but, and this is where Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda really shines here, now, dear reader, Natsuki is actually a satire of all those anime cliches. Her actions in fact, actually spell doom for the main heroine and well, you'll just have to find out what happens. No spoilers here! 
As the whole story wraps up, Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda ends up being one of the most profound anime of our time for its strong social commentary and its clever use of the mundane and common to subvert all of our expectations, creating simply a unique package. 
Or that's what I thought after downing a few beers to justify this anime's existence.

My Hero Academia's biggest weakness is how painfully slow the plot moves forward. We're - episodes into the season, and nothing has happened that couldn't have been condensed into - episode. 
That's not to say there aren't other glaring issues like a dialogue that could be written by a -- year old. To the point you could skip an entire scene and know what happened. But we aren't here to be blown away by dialogue, it's a shounen. We're here to see good animation, fun characters, and an intriguing plot. So do we get any of that? 
Animation: -/-- 
The animation quality is the same as it's been in season - with no progression. It seems they're content with ""mediocre"" to ""bad"". Fight scenes are very rare, and when they do occur there's a whole lot of stills with camera panning. It feels like a cop-out and the rest of the show are stills with moving mouths... where's the budget for an insanely popular show? 
Characters: -/-- 
So are the characters fun at least? Not really. They've been the same person re-learning ""I need to be the best"" in varying ways. They're all identical to who they were in Season -. There is nothing interesting about Midoriya since he's a parrot that can only say ""I need to get stronger"" for -- episodes. His arc for every season is the same because it's solely that. Everyone else is just as bad or simply forgotten about unless they want to spend -- minutes naming them all. The humor in this show is so repetitive and childish. All of the characters suck is all I really have to say. 
Plot: -/-- 
But the plot must be good! Alas, it isn't. The villains screen time is so limited it's basically them doing ""villain"" things and what that means is... they show up on screen as stills for - seconds and some announcer tells you what they did and then we get to hear the heroes talk about it for -- minutes. That or they get an actual scene and it's some of the best the show has to offer, but it ends on a ""mysterious"" note never to be touched up on again. Each episode ends on a ""wow, this is about to get real"" but it's just a cliffhanger that ends anti-climactically every time. There's no pay off, it's just forced tension. Now it's just another plot line where they get to talk about what they're going to do for --- episodes to save on budget and get you ""hyped"" for a fight incoming. Which will most likely be underwhelming as well. 
Summary: -/-- 
So is it worth watching? Not really, you could skip past all the dialogue and know what they talked about(and even if you didn't) they'll bring it up in flashbacks every episode anyway.  Painfully boring dialogues and humor that's mixed in serious scenes to make it so you aren't ""as bored"" always miss and just make it worse... I guess you could skim through episodes and wait for the pay-off episode at the end where they actually fight and the animation is either mediocre or good in places. That's about where all the budget for this show goes considering it sure as hell isn't in writing or talking mouth stills.

this was a -- episode rollercoaster ride of love and hate, and there were times that i had tears in my eyes, either that of hope and glee, or sadness.  even being weeks later from finishing this anime, i am still left sort of bittersweet from it, and this feeling was way stronger and actually made me depressed and stressed out about the ending. 
i won't spoil anything, because i'm not allowed to, but if you dare to watch this all the way through, get ready to be at least unsatisfied by how it ends, yet, there is hope, since there is a sequel that will butcher your emotions even further, but at least will compensate the ending of the original series. 
more or less, i am not a big fan of mecha based series, i have little interest in robots, but this story is very character driven i'd say, and so if air surfing robot fighting isn't really alluring to you, know that the main underline of this is hope and love and friendship and prevailing against impossible odds. 
there will be times where you are confused, but most of everything gets explained eventually, just be patient and try to view things as simply as possible until the bigger picture unravels. 
overall, this anime isn't perfect, but it's great and i'd recommend it to anyone who can tolerate robot things and the weird premise of surfing in the sky, because other than any minor qualms you may have, you must admit despite some level of cheesiness, there is a lot of emotion to be found within the depths of this anime, and it can be powerful.

Sorry for my bad English first 
This anime has nothing special, really!  
The plot is very ordinary and it even worse than anime series of the same genre. This series has a bunch of fan service scenes. Moreover, the protagonists are too boring. Let's see. We have all the typical characters here: a tsundere loli Neko-girl, a BB elf, and a Maou-sama with the maximum level of power. And that's all this series has. 
Summarily, the whole story is just about our maou-sama's power and how those - girls fall for him. There is no hilariousness, no monumental fight scenes. It has nothing but fan service. SO, DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME

Story: 
We meet this Pathologist named Zwei who is a tourist assasination. But all of a sudden She meets Ein who also a Pathologist. They both lost their memories by Inferno. He needs to survive and claw his way through in order to stay alive. 
As you move on through the story, the story expands more and get suspense. But, at the final arc it will get confusing and leads you to say wtf? Decent story but confusing.

I'm most definitely in the minority here when I say this anime isn't good, and looking at all the other positive reviews on this show I can already tell this will receive bad feedback. This show is unique comedy in its own way. It has a basic plot of a pink haired guy with superpowers trying to live a normal life. This anime is full of cliches and overused tropes, but uses them to its advantage and the show basically becomes a guy doing everything in his power to avoid cliches. Anyone who likes these kinds of comedy will definitely be interested in this but I will try to highlight the positives and negatives of this show. 
Pros: 
-Has a unique approach to comedy. With its way of dealing with cliches it makes for a fun watch 
-Characters are pretty fun for a while, and it's enjoyable watching every one of them mess with Saiki's life 
-Some moments can manage you make you laugh, even if it is just for a short moment. 
Cons: 
-Art can get pretty bad at times, but nothing enough to make you hate the show. 
-The comedy can get really repetitive and this is my main issue with this anime. At first it will manage to get a few laughs out of you but then what? After about the first -- short episodes it runs out of ideas, really quickly. The characters go through the same process every episode, there's a dumb guy, a guy who thinks he has superpowers but doesn't, a popular girl who wants Saiki's attention and a few other people heavily relied on for comedy. Everyone and everything just becomes repetitive and boring to watch. 
-Even if it has a unique approach, the plot is unoriginal and nothing spectacular. 
Overall: 
Apologies if the review was a bit shorter than most, i'm kinda tired now. To summarise, although the humour is there and it can be fun at some points, the comedy gets really dry and repeated really quickly. Not much changes plot or comedy wise so I recommend watching this at around - short episodes (- compiled) a day so you don't get too bored too quickly.

Depression;Gate -: An Unserious Review 
The heart wrenching, time looping, mind melting titan of anime has returned, and holy gel-nanas does it deliver. In case it needs saying, this series only makes sense after watching the original season and the “Divide by Zero” alternate episode --. Do yourself a favour and make sure you’ve seen that suffer-fest before delving into this one. 
Steins;Gate - feels so very much like the original. The cast are as lovable as ever, the tone can switch from light to dark in an instant, and the world line theory is still just as absorbing. But the real separation between this series and its predecessor is a very noticeable hole in the shape of two personalities: Makise Kurisu and Hououin Kyouma. 
Where the original creates character tension by pitting these two against each other, Zero accomplishes the same by simply highlighting their absence. Shadows of Kurisu’s presence remain in the form of her lab colleague Hiyajo, and Amadeus, the AI based off her pre-Japan memories. As for Kyouma, he remains locked away inside Rintaro’s mind, buried under layers of fear and regret. Zero plays on this absence time and time again. There are so many references to things lost that it’s no wonder Rintaro can’t get a hold of himself. 
The story re-treads much of the same ground. The early episodes feel like the heady days of gel-nanas, Alpacaman and too-too-roo! But it’s a false happiness marred by a painful past and a terrible, inevitable future. And after a few personal crises and interventions by “The Organisation,” the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory get their lab coats into gear to thwart World War III once again. It’s all very familiar, but with a much darker, less optimistic feel. 
If I had to pin down the central theme of the show, I would say that many of the characters have trouble facing up to reality. Okabe Rintaro is the obvious example: he’s so far-gone that he’s willing to abandon Hououin Kyouma, his research, his lab, and his past, all while consciously forgetting about the apocalypse to come. But there are others. Super Hax-r Daru and the ever-adorable Mayushii have similar hurdles to overcome. Only when their delusions are banished can these characters grow and achieve their potential. 
Steins;Gate - doesn’t manage to innovate in the same way as its predecessor, but the way it builds on its past makes it a worthy successor to one of the greatest anime titles of all time. 
Mission accomplished. El Psy Congroo.

Thoughts Overall: Ok.. where do I start.. Neon genesis Evangelion when going into it I honestly thought of it as a very famous mecha fighting anime and expected to see top notch mecha fights against the enemies. The anime did have amazing animation during battling scenes but fighting in mech's wasn't what the anime was about at all. I think of the story of evangelion as being the most intriguing to the state of minds in people. Depression has and is around in people's daily lives and coming from the last - episodes they convey what the show was truly about. From the inner monologues from our main character's we see how they were broken down by the world and are looking for a place to be reborn into. I was completely confused on what was going on because my mindset was only on the mecha action I didn't understand what was going on at the moment but coming from the final episode I could say that this story wise get's a -- but if that were the only factor I would've given it one.

This series simply doesn't get the credit that it should, instead DBZ seems to get majority of the praise. I enjoyed both series and have watched them a ridiculous amount of times, but Dragonball has something that DBZ didn't, I don't know what that something is, but it's what makes Dragon ball the better series.  
-Comedy (Not much of this carried over to DBZ) 
-The series based around the tournaments 
-Jackie Chun 
Three things that made DB great; don't get me wrong, I would still rate DBZ perfect as well, I just don't think it's as clever as Dragonball.

This isn't a professional review or anything just a review from your average anime watcher. I've watched all the episodes of Overlord thus far and I have to say I have no clue as to why they've ruined the series in the last - seasons. First season was an absolute blast and a really good overall anime however -nd season and -rd season have just been side stories about some meaningless characters for about -----% of the season with no action. I don't know if I'm missing the point and when I went to check the rating of this season I was expecting to see an overall -/-- just because well the first season was good (otherwise I'd be expecting a - or -) but shockingly was greeted with an -.--/--. If you want my honest opinion, stop at season -.

A complete and utter waste of time. Especially Love alliance was a pain in the ass. Almost had to quit in the middle. Certainly could have been made better. I think it can be watched with joy if you like sisters who sounds annoying and act like morons. If you must watch this series prepare to be --y old once again, or be so drunk that you don't remember anything. And if you think that it must be good because Onegai teacher was, in that case you are wrong. Only good thing in the series was that there is only -- episodes.

Kaichou wa maid sama...apparently a must when it comes to shoujo manga...well, I'm really far from agreeing with that, there are so many much more interesting shoujo manga than this one.  
If the plot was quite promising, the evolvement of the characters and the story was disappointing. Talking about characters, about the main female lead dear...so cliche, the usual tsundere-ish type who doesn't love the male lead and pretend to not feel a thing through chapters and chapters...it's something that we've seen in so many other shoujo. Okay, the fact that she was focusing on earning money since her family is poor while being the student council president and secure her future that got me, I was attracted to that tough and determinate misaki, but the way she kept on showing weaknesses and being bashful in front of Usui while refusing to accept her feeling for a long time kind of annoyed me in the end, well, because I'm the feminist type and I hate to show my weak self to others especially guys. And Usui, well, if physically like-again- any male lead he was a godlike figure, I found him too...perfect. I mean let's be honest, a guy like that he's far from being real even in a manga, I found it hard to immersed myself into it since Usui was so flawless, weird but well it's a pure personal opinion.

This series is just concentrated entertainment.  It has every element and they are blended together in perfect harmony, much like (some of) the food that is prepared in the show. 
-. It's funny.  The chibi drawings in particular are cute and always at least get a smile out of me.  Everything in this show is so over the top that you have to laugh at it.  Sometimes it's just so stupid, but in a good way, because it doesn't take itself seriously.  There is no pretension here. 
-. It really energizes you.  There is constant competition, overcoming-of-challenges, people are gracious in defeat.  There's cliff hangers at all the right places, and just enough unpredictability.  Like any good sports anime, basically.   
-. All the characters are lovable.  And it's not often that i say this about a series, but practically all of them are great here.  They're not too archetypal, nor do they have unrealistic gimmicks.  In this case, they usually have a food specialty and/or backstory that helps them stand out.   
-. Endless eye candy.  The girls look cute, really cute.  They're consistently well drawn, often have big tits, and there is fan service a plenty.  It's forced as hell, but that is intentional, as it ends up looking like a parody of itself, and i can appreciate that.  But really it's the food that is the most pleasant to look at.  Detailed, colorful dishes and ingredients that are on par with Non Non Biyori's backgrounds in visual appeal.   
I've said a lot of good things, but i can't really give it more than an -.  Sure it's enjoyable, but there is not much of a story, no complexity.  It gets repetitive fast, but generally remains enjoyable.  Also another issue is that i happen to be a foodie myself and generally they fail to create dishes that i would actually want to eat.  Plenty of them are not even really feasible in reality.  Not a big deal, but if they went the extra mile to do extra culinary research, it would have earned the extra point to hit the - mark. 
Just watch it, i don't know anybody who didn't enjoy this series.

The story is basically the two main characters falling for two other people and help each other to get close to their crushes. Over time, they fall in love with each other. They find new friends and build new relationships. The story is short, sweet, and simple while relying on the character's interactions as a major driving force of the anime.

The art was colorful and vivid which is vital for me when watching an anime.

The sound was good and the voice acting. The first opening's melody and tune really got stuck in my head.

The anime as I said, is built on character interactions. The characters are also unique like Yusaku.

I really enjoyed this anime even thought I prefer fantasy, sword fighting, magic using anime. So, yeah. It's good. Go watch it. 
Overall: -/-- 
So, as I said, the anime is good and worth watching. Also, Taiga is so cute. Please just watch it for yourself. Go now.

---- started off with a bang by having two quality shows air alongside the latest installment of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventures—all being strong contenders for Anime of the Year. It was the safest of safe bets that Mob Psycho --- II, and Golden Wind were going to be great. Usually I feel a sense of relief when that’s proved out, but honestly, both shows were such a mortal lock that I never even worried about it—the euphoria is all from the brilliance of both series itself. Dororo, by contrast, was much more of an unknown quantity which is certainly ironic given that it comes from the pen of the guy who basically invented both modern manga and anime, and is directed by the guy who helmed Rurouni Kenshin. But this was known as one of Osamu Tezuka’s lesser works, without a definitive ending, and Rurouni Kenshin was a long time ago now. But this is a case where pedigree speaks volumes. 
As a viewer, it becomes clear when exactly you’re in the care of master storytellers—without realizing it you’re mesmerized, a door within the fire creaks and all you wish for is to hear the tale told to the end. There’s a real sense of privilege at being able to immerse yourself in a show capable of delivering it. The nature of this series—at least as reimagined by Furuhashi, Kobayasahi, and MAPPA—is extremely cinematic in every way. The series is being directed like a short theatrical film with every episode, and that’s accented all the more by the nature of the story, with each youkai representing a new body part for Hyakkimaru. Stand-alone narratives paired with Furuhashi’s cinematography and the lush backgrounds mean that every episode feels self-contained, with a recognizable introduction, body, and conclusion. That could be dangerous in the wrong hands or with the wrong material, leading to a disjointed feel to the series as a whole, but that appears to be no danger here. Self-contained or not, each episode is contributing a piece of the overall puzzle just as each demon slaying is building towards the completion of Hyakkimaru. 
If any anime could ever be timeless it would be a Tezuka adaptation, and Dororo answers the bell. There’s something so timeless about the buddy picture—it transcends not just eras, but language and continents too. Make one of the pairs a kid and you add another layer, and—as Tezuka was especially brilliant at—when you pair two characters who are stark opposites the dynamic can be really powerful. Dororo is a little chatterbox, a force of nature, Hyakkimaru the literal definition of stoicism and impassivity. It’s a recipe for great character chemistry and they complete each other—she (Dororo) becomes his mouthpiece for the most part of the show, guiding him to becoming more human while Hyakkimaru becomes her protector. Both giving each other a sense of hope and belonging in a world that has been unfair to them. I found our duo protagonists were easy to relate to and sympathize with due to how well they are handled, showing layered characterization to their personalities with flaws. 
Dororo is an example of the power of great storytelling in anime—there’s just no substitute for it.  This series has no gimmicks, no tropes, no pandering or even ingratiation—just a superbly-crafted premise which carries all the dramatic weight under its own power. And while the god of anime and manga in Tezuka explains that to an extent, of course, but this version is so changed from the source material that a great deal of credit must go to the anime staff too. I’m not sure I can remember too many adaptations that have done this kind of giant slalom narrative format, weaving back and forth between original and source content, and certainly not so seamlessly. They manage to pull all the fascinating elements and characters the series has introduced together coherently and its pure and straightforward brilliance, in many ways, are very simple in design despite the subtlety and complexity of the story. You don’t have to reinvent or revolutionize to achieve greatness in anime—you just have to be great, and Dororo is great.   
Even without the presence of youkai and curses, the Sengoku period was a pretty awful time to be in Japan. Man’s inhumanity to man seemed to know no bounds, warfare was incessant, and “honor” compelled men to do dishonorable things every day. Add demons tempting us to even worse and you have Dororo’s bloody and terrifying landscape. The genius is in the telling and Furuhashi’s touch is so light and deft—he lets the moments speak for themselves. There so much quiet poetry to this series. It resides in the consistently gorgeous visuals, which tell a story of their own. And it resides in the story itself, which is where the heart of Tezuka Osamu still beats the most loudly in a show that’s changed things quite a bit from the source material. Pathos and tragedy imbue every frame, but the genius of Tezuka is that no matter how bleak a story he’s telling, he manages to convey a fundamental belief that human compassion and love will redeem us in the end. It can be hard to believe that sometimes given what he and Furuhashi show us, but I think that’s rather the point. If the faith of any sort were easy to achieve, it wouldn’t be necessary in the first place. 
The story doesn’t pull any punches either—all of the evil, brutality, and savagery humans are capable of is on display in merciless fashion. There are so many crushingly depressing arcs in the best possible way. It’s not possible to produce that degree of pathos without a tremendously high level of writing, which this series clearly has. Watching Dororo grow up too soon for all the wrong reasons is one of the saddest parts of this story for me where she is forced to make decisions where the outcome is a tragedy for herself or the people of the world, or she is a witness to this through Hyakkimaru, in order to survive. This is what evil does—it forces good people to make impossible decisions with no right answers, and that’s the tragedy at the heart of this series. And there couldn’t be any truer words for Hyakkimaru for simply existing due to what his father, Daigo, did to him at birth to achieve power and prosperity. I do believe the question being asked throughout Dororo is that is it better to die with honor or to compromise and live? I think back to Dororo’s father in Hibukuro, and no one can question that he died an honorable death, but he left his wife and child behind, and she died to save their daughter—but not before one of the most gut-wrenching scenes in anime this year, where she shows her devotion by accepting boiling gruel for a starving Dororo in her bare hands in a period of famine. 
The narrative structure here is as traditional as it gets—the first cour was used to introduce all the players in the game and set up the board. We now understand exactly what’s at stake here, and mostly understand the people whose lives hang in the balance. The second cour is the reckoning when everyone will have to live with the decisions they’ve made, and irreconcilable desires will clash violently. There’s no question that the story is playing hardball with the moral ambiguities. I personally find the matter of what Daigo did to Hyakkimaru pretty clear-cut—it was evil and should be punished—but now the burden of that decision has been placed on Hyakkimaru’s head. And Biwamaru (a spiritual guide and observer) is not letting him off the hook—he flat-out reminds Hyakkimaru that to get his body back is to destroy his father’s domain, which means hundreds upon hundreds of people will suffer and perish. This situation asks some very difficult questions both of the characters and the audience, of that there can be no doubt. In this world, there are no black or white, only shades of grey.   
This is the ultimate moral dilemma Tezuka—and probably at least as much Furuhashi and Kobayashi—have laid in Dororo.  As the powerful commit atrocities in the name of the greater good, these two innocents are asked to forgo the chance to better their own lives for the sake of the world that has hurt them so badly. They’re forced to confront the fact that righting wrongs may, in fact, cause great suffering to those who bear no guilt in the matter. It’s a cruel fate, but once more I take small solace in the fact that at the very least, these two have found each other. For me, there’s a distinct sense of hopefulness that seeps through in drips and drops throughout that enriches the diversity of the series as a whole. In a world as dark as the one depicted here it’s nice to see a little light once in a while. And it is not just a single tragic tone either, there are genuine heart-warming moments, some wholesome comedy, and it knows exactly when to implement these elements. If it were tragedy every week, it would soon lose much of its emotional impact. And you have to believe there’s some hope for redemption in this world, or there’s no point in enduring all that existential pain. 
The other characters are all great, consistent and well written. Far from stagnant or caricatures. Tahoumaru and Itachi have many of the same characteristics as our protagonists, but they’re misdirected. Biwamaru and Jukai offer love and wisdom, they guide Dororo and Hyakkimaru without holding their hands, and many of the shows questions to the audience are asked through them. Daigo is not a one-dimensional villain, and his actions are mainly the result of being alive in the Sengoku era. And just overall, all the people our main characters meet along their journey all feel like real people. They are charismatic figures with strong resolves and their actions and interactions with each other are all in-character, no one is rewritten. This series presents a true dualistic narrative as few others do. Hyakkimaru and Dororo complement each other perfectly as people as well as they do in narrative terms, with Hyakkimaru’s arc driving the story, but Dororo’s giving everything that happens context and perspective. 
Furthermore, Hyakkimaru represents the body of the story and Dororo the soul—or if you prefer, Hyakkimaru’s life is the canvas and Dororo’s is the painting. In a very real sense Dororo, child though she is, has undertaken no less than the task of teaching Hyakkimaru how to be a human being. He’s literally a blank canvas, and she has an image in her mind of the person he truly is (or will someday be). And we can already see evidence of this, a personality emerging in Hyakkimaru as well as a voice. It says something for Dororo’s strength that as much as she’s suffered, she still takes it on herself to perpetually try and lift Hyakkimaru’s soul away from the pain his cursed existence causes him.  
The production team at MAPPA with Furuhashi and Kobayasahi at the helm of Tezuka’s brainchild did an amazing job bringing his manga to life. The gorgeous ink backgrounds, the perfect casting, the amazing soundtrack, the impeccable cinematography, and direction—it was just a marvel on every level. Furuhashi’s decision to use mostly black-and-white for the flashback sequences is interesting, given that the original Dororo anime was broadcast in black-and-white. It’s also a marvelous way to use rare splotches of color to really create impact, as he does like splashes of red in a monochrome palette for example, and then more color as the time progresses. The look of the series, which is classic Tezuka character designs and fluid and stylish animation against a backdrop that looks like a series of wall scrolls hanging in a temple or palace somewhere. It is visual poetry of the highest order. All OP and ED are beautifully animated and have great song choices. I personally love the second ED song, ""Yamiyo (闇夜)"" by Eve. 
Dororo is truly like stepping inside a classic Japanese folk tale—it transports you so effortlessly to this turbulent time when death was life’s constant companion. Really, it’s the supreme ease and confidence both Tezuka’s source material and Furuhashi’s direction brings to Dororo that make it the burgeoning classic that it was destined to be. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this series and I am an awe of it. I truly believe and feel that the best of what this year had to offer came in the winter season and Dororo does deserve to be up there with Mob Psycho --- II and Golden Wind as Anime of the Year contenders. I recommend this series to anyone, its timeless, it has a Disney-esque to it, and is the kind of show that fans of the medium should seek after.

Much like with western entertainment, there are certain TV series and movies that stand out not just as promising installments of new or existing franchises, but also as popular events that a large portion of the community with wait in massive anticipation for. In the world of anime, the ""events"" that captures the most attention are new additions to the Monogatari series, an anime that began back in ---- and is continuously pumping out sequels to this day. However, during the past year, the formula for how new entries into this franchise are premiered has changed drastically. Rather than being part of the regular seasonal lineup, new Monogatari arcs are now released in large chunks, with one entire story being contained in each of these chunk. So, does the newest entry into the Monogatari franchise live up to its household name? 
Before diving into the actual story, I want to briefly give praise to Shinbo and Studio Shaft for finally recognizing a formula that works best for Monogatari, and that is giving us a single adaptation of one of the novels all at once. With a story as complicated and complex as Monogatari, pacing out each story over the course of four to six weeks felt incredibly prolonged and not very engaging because it practically requires a recap every time a new episode came out. However, by releasing it in feature length film-sized chunks, we can get the entire story all at once, making the loss of certain details over time less acute. This might sound like a very minor detail, but presentation is hugely important, especially with something as eclectic as Monogatari, though I can't say with zero reservations that I would be all for continuing this formula for the rest of the franchise, as it would also mean that the hype levels would fluctuate uncontrollably over the course of releases. 
Getting back to the matter of Tsukimonogatari specifically, I wouldn't say that this is one of the worst stories to come from the franchise, but coming off the heels of Hanamonogatari last summer makes it feel a bit weak by comparison, though there wasn't anything necessarily wrong with the main story of this arc. My biggest problem, however, lies in the introduction. While I did very much enjoy the beginning scene that contained a prolonged philosophical discussion about the nature of life and ""not"" life, despite taking up the entire first five minutes of this four-episode series, my true problem lies in what happens once the story actually begins, as we are treated to nearly fifteen minutes of what I can only describe as a self-congratulatory revel in Monogatari-style fan service. To put it bluntly: Araragi is messing around with his sisters' naked bodies again. While I wouldn't say that it reaches ""toothbrush"" levels of perversion, it still reminded me of a lot of things that I didn't like about Nisemonogatari. 
Once we get into the meat of the story, however, Tsuki immediately kicks it into high gear, and we spend the rest of the series enveloped in the ""talking heads""-style intense discussions and schemes of Araragi and the other characters. This one isn't so much a character study like Hana was, but instead has more emphasis on the actual story, and the thrill of following Araragi and the others as they plan and debate over the most minute of details is just as thrilling as it was way back in Bakemonogatari. 
While the characters don't necessarily take center stage for this arc, there's still quite a bit of interesting development that occurs. Araragi surprisingly ends up getting more development than he's gotten since Nekomonogatari, as we watch him struggle with the changes in his vampiric powers and how that's affecting him on both a strategic level and an emotional one. Yotsugi Ononoki also takes on the main character role once again, and while I initially didn't really see them being able to do much with a character that wasn't very interesting in the first place, she ends up being surprisingly compelling, both for herself and for Araragi, and discussions centered around her that focus on what constitutes true life and the difference between true and artificial life give this series its trademark introspective edge. As for new faces, there is one new character named Tadatsuru, and while I can't go in detail into how he plays into the plot due to spoilers, I will say that despite his short appearance on-screen, he ended up being rather fascinating. Finally, we have Ougi Oshino, whom the series has been continuously teasing us with since the beginning of Second Season, and while her appearance is rather brief this time, much like in Hana, she still manages to interject a new perspective into the discussions being had. 
As always, the animation was produced by Shaft, and, to be honest, there's very little need for me to discuss the animation by this point, assuming that those of you still reading are up-to-date on the series. The massive contrasts in color, surreal CG that manages to fit rather well despite being very obviously CG, random ""black screen"" cuts, and as many head tilts and you can snap your neck at are all still present, though in terms of symbolism, I still think Hana, while still a bit on the blatant side, did a much better job with attempting to convey the overall message of the story. 
There is still no dub for this series, and, once again, this series stands as one of the few that I think would be significantly hindered by a dub, simply because of how much talking there actually is. 
The soundtrack seems to be firmly stuck in the hands of Kei Haneoka now, who took over for Satoru Kōsaki starting with Hana, and while I wouldn't say that the soundtrack has changed significantly from its usual eclectic nature, it did feel a bit more ""traditional"" and less overtly stylized. I can't really complain about any of the tracks specifically, and some of them were actually rather moving, but I would certainly hate to see the usual Monogatari style soundtrack disappear completely. The opening theme ""Orange Mint"" was performed by Saori Hayami (VA for Ononoki) and opens with a techno-inspired song with the usual Monogatari flair that puts it a step above the average, while the ending theme ""border"" by ClariS plays us out with their usual energized J-pop sound. 
Overall, while I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite stories from the franchise so far, Tsukimonogatari is yet another welcome addition into the franchise, though to be honest everything I'm saying right now is rather pointless when you think about it. If you like Monogatari as much as I do, then you probably already finished watching this new story before I could even post this review, and if you don't like Monogatari, then this is certainly not going to change your mind because it really is just more of the same.

Story = -  
-- Pretty much everyone has seen one of those ""Let's investigate the school's seven mysteries episodes.""  This story is a combination of that and the movie Ghostbusters.  Although, it combines them separately.  It's as if two separate entities have been born within one anime. 
--  An anime that turns into nothing more than the daily adventures of the ghost club was actually meant to be a well-thought out flow of events.  
--  Imagine you watched a movie, now then, have a -- year-old go back and fill in - and a half hours worth of screen time. 
--  There were so many plot holes that I'm amazed the developers aren't cripples yet.   
--  Now include, the most forced romance since Edward Elric and Eren Jaeger. 
Art = - 
--  The characters and scenery fit the setting quite well.   
--  Each individual pretty much adds his or her own flavor to the series and only enhances the scenes. 
--  There are a few lazy looking moments throughout the anime, but nothing that can't be overlooked. 
Sound = - 
--  There were times where the music would just kill the mood.  At other times it was a good addition.  Most likely a result of the on-going identity crisis that went on throughout the anime. 
--  The character voices were pleasing.  My only gripe is that Kobayashi, Yuu was completely out of her field.  Her expertise is little boys and tomboys.   
--  The ending and opening songs were nice, but didn't even really fit the atmosphere of the anime, until about the ninth episode. 
Characters = - 
--  There were some good character in this and they had some very likeable traits.  Sadly the anime was about the main characters instead.   
--  The worst part about the two main characters is that they were actually the most two unfit characters in the series.  A quirky anime about occults decided to focus on a horribly written tsundere and a randomly selected spoon-bender. 
--  I actually wish the two main characters had thought bubbles above their heads.  They were honestly ridiculous and not in a comedic way. 
--  The two main characters did develop, but it felt like a rick-roll. 
Enjoyment = - 
--   Some very good things were here.  Sadly someone bought a lot of screen time and suddenly didn't know what to do with it. 
--  Enough good scenes and developments to have made two separate anime.  At times one could sit back and enjoy the goings-on of this anime, until they remembered what was supposed to be happening. 
--  Episodes --- were had their redeeming qualities.  Episode - and ---- had their own Kool-Aid packet to add to the mix.  I believe others would still enjoy the experience.   
Overall = - 
--  Due to the incoherence of this anime, it is kind of hard to believe one should watch this.  There are simply too many superior choices in whatever genre one wanted from Occult Academy.

This one is short review I copy from my blog. ( Visit here for more detailed version but contains spoiler » http://rui-anime.weebly.com/ruis-anime-blog/bungou-stray-dogs-s--review-spoiler ) 
The ending of Season - was hanging with the emergence from Port Mafia boss & The Guild member. Back then, I was thinking that Bungou Stray Dogs [文豪ストレイドッグス] Season - would be -- episodes rather than -- episodes to continue the story. The fate rang another option. Season - announced when the hype of the -st season was still in the air. My expectation for Season - definitely, as Mori-san said in the last episode of the -st, “challenging wartime situation​,” with newcomers enter the battle field of the Gifted. 
PLOT: - 
In brief the -nd season of Bungou Stray Dogs is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates Dazai’s past experience. It is not just a quick glance in an episode, it takes more than two episodes for past life events only. Gladly we’re offered by Dazai’s past that contains several information (which has relation now) and insight to characters as the members of Port Mafia. This past experience of his life has a strong relation with what happens now in the background after - years of it. The second part, of course, is all about war XD whoopsie not really but yesh I guess. The second part of it has several issues: where does Kyouka belong?; the fight over Atsushi; the fight among three Gifted organizations; and some of characters intimacy (reunion). 
The flash-forward or flashback chronological order is like a peek-a-boo, I felt mocked when I was waiting for the explanation of what The Guild ulterior motive really is as they appeared in the last episode of Season -. But, it’s just awhile I felt like that. I absorbed by the storyline of this kind of flashback and sat quietly to watch each episode. The flashback succeed to make correlation in the past and present of current characterizations and events. The masterpiece parts of this series happen after that. All of the fight, troublesome issues, brilliant strategies, advices, characters development, and of course for action-supranatural anime, the visualization aspect. The story if I can say in a phrase, is, splendid like games of mind. 
ART & CHAR DEV: - & -- 
The past experience of Dazai appeared to be sullen with dark and shades, not much details in the surrounding I could find there. I think the focus is only for the story itself. Jump up to the current situation with fucking tension everywhere, the comedy scenes are less than the previous season. There aren’t many silly scenes (which is appropriate for such complicated situation, but I miss the comedy parts like the -st season). The visualization is much more appealing than the first season. I don’t know which is the most suitable reason for it, but I guess it’s because the anime is also embedded feelings in it. So many feelings (but not an emotional one). Sometimes I even got motivated by it, or sometimes touched. Even if the series has so many characters, even more than the first season, I gave it two-thumbs up for being able to cover their roles in right parts. Every major characters development can be seen clearly, particularly their self. The main supporting roles assist the major characters development as well as the sequence of issues. The minor supporting roles are still there, with momentary scenes but fill up well. I never expected about the very reasoning of a few characters act or say for the things they do, they have firm mindset and value about things. The character development is intently mesmerizing, one after another. Since we are being served with also the past life of the organizations here we can grab more the information about the relationship between them (their potential connection). even their mindset all pouring in -- eps of second season. Such a large amount of chars but presented in a fucking right portion unexpectedly. The visualization is supported by characters development is in line with the problematic troubles that must be beared, The pressure is real. The visualization is magnificent. I still recall many scenes there. 
​ 
SOUND: -- 
OP Theme Song is sung by SCREEN mode, “Reason Living”. I love it in an instant, the lyrics are great as it should be. Check it out MV SCREEN mode - Reason Living. The ED song is sung by Luck Life. Luck Life also sang the theme song for Bungou Stray Dogs -st season. Meanwhile, “Namae wo Yobu yo” in the -st season is more relaxing, the ED theme song for the -nd season, “Kaze ga Fuku Machi (風が吹く街)” is an upbeat one. Luck Life is not disappointing me even with the upbeat song, MV Kaze ga Fuku Machi. If you’re looking for the lyric, the song portrays the inner-self of characters in Bungou Stray Dogs precisely. 
It’s definitely common to find such a promising series got supported for Season -. I wish this one is going to be that way too. -++! All hail Bungou Stray Dogs series, I’m considering to join fandom now /slapped/. 
Pros: 
- Those freaking animation. better than the well-made -st season 
- More competitive story and supporting by balanced char dev. It’s a mind game. the series drives me crazy (hyped up when watch it) 
- Nice theme songs

I've only watched the first episode but I'm already deciding to stop. 
*SPOILERS FOR EPISODE -* 
The basic RAPE at the end of the first episode is no way for a good bl to start and basically doesn't show the best side of shounen ai anime. Honestly was looking forward to this but didn't think that it would start off as coercion. Let's say that it wasn't the main character that performed this act it may have added a little darker tone but having him fall in love with his RAPIST is ridiculous. No matter how many fantasies are fulfilled I just wish it hadn't started off like this... 
The art and sound are actually amazing and they're very much to my taste, I just can't get over the inital plot

Nodame Cantibile is a lighthearted and comedic anime about one of my favorite hobbies, music.  At first I was hesitant to explore the series due to my lack of appreciation for the classical genre, but what I found in Nodame Cantibile was more than just music.  This was a coming of age story of sorts, with a feel good plot line and characters full of passion, all battling their own internal struggles to be better musicians.  It’s definitely a nice change of pace and a must see for any slice of life fan, or enthusiast of music in general. 
I don’t have any major complaints about the story in this series, but at the same token, I wasn’t necessarily blown away.  For the entire -- episodes, viewers follow Nodame and Chiaki, both students at the same Japanese music school as they grow both as individuals and through their musical talents.  The added atypical romance subplot was interesting, as an awkward attraction exists between them (well, mostly just Nodame).  Boy meets neighbor girl.  Girl turns out to be weird as hell.  Girl thinks boy is a handsome prince.  Girl is the metaphoric rain man of piano.  Boy finds girl oddly intriguing.  Romance ensues.  It’s a unique and cute story that blossoms into a tear filled happy ending.  What can I say, I like the mushy stuff too. 
Perhaps my favorite aspect of Nodame Cantibile was the music.  As a longtime drummer myself, I could definitely relate to the amount of stress and competition the various characters encounter to get through music school.  They’re constantly practicing and trying to get the competitive edge on their adversaries, waiting for that one lucky break to launch them into the music elite category.  All the musical appreciation by no means indicates that you have to be an aficionado to enjoy the show, as I had a few friends start the show with me, all of us remarking on how pleasant it was.   
Lastly, I really enjoyed the comedy in this series.   It rarely, if ever, felt forced.   And on top of that, I always enjoyed the blunt reactions Chiaki had toward Nodame’s advances on him.  There were also some really cheeky moments between characters in the orchestra as well as a witty harem aspect to Chiaki himself.  He was always making snide comments about the various girls he was repelling on a daily basis.  It was nice to see a harem that was caught up in the mix himself.  The writers also did a great job with the dialogue, being well placed and purposeful at almost every instance. 
I really enjoyed both main characters in this anime.  Chiaki is a perfectionist, never use to failing, but at the same time having to deal with the struggles of wanting to be a conductor but being stuck in a piano major.  Chiaki works through the series trying to find himself, striving to be the conductor of his very own orchestra, while battling deep dwelling inner demons and coping with high school life.  Nodame is a perplexing girl who is generally messy and sometimes acts childish, but has an almost sixth sense when it comes to playing the piano.  I did like how whimsical and free she acted during the show, and how she would often enter trances when she was focused on something so intensely.  She even had the pleasure of Chiaki being her neighbor, so of course she made him cook her meals and often referred to herself as “the wife”.  Nodame’s internal struggles were also unique and helped adequately explain why she was the way she was… it was quite an interesting past to uncover.  I wish there were more female leads like her, with a nonconforming personality and goofy one liners; she really was a pillar in making this story as strong as it was. 
The supporting cast was filled in nicely as well.  Mise was a wacky rock star who was tamed and disciplined by the unprecedented talent of Chiaki.  Stresseman posed as an odd but effective mentor for Chiaki, even though he had some problems controlling himself with the ladies… The rest of the S and Rising Star Orchestra members played their roles well and added to the overall completeness of the cast.  The character development was pretty decent overall for a relatively short -- episode anime. 
The art style is typical for a mid ----’s anime, but I think I would’ve enjoyed some more vibrant colors in the scenery and backdrops due to the jovial nature of the show.  Also, while the piano hand shots were accurate and smooth, when the orchestra would play the scene would often show stills of the musicians vice their actual hand movements on each instrument.  Nonetheless, this was only a minor complaint.  The characters were well designed, and I really think that Nodame’s bright gleaming eyes fit with her expressive personality.  Chiaki’s messed up hair and slender face added to his harem believability. 
As expected, the sound in Nodame Cantibile is top notch.  I’m not entirely sure what directions or influences the creator had for this show, but they were musically accurate and spectacular.  Each rendition of Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven was magical in its own sense, and made the anime very pleasant to just close your eyes and listen to.  I also really thought the intro added a burst of energy and excitement to the show, enticing the viewer with what was to come.  I personally watched the series in Japanese and thought the voice acting (particularly Nodame’s) was superb. 
Nodame Cantibile is a show that I would recommend to just about anyone.  I was looking for a nice change of pace after watching some more serious shows and I got just what I was asking for.  Lots of great comedy, a cheerful and believable romance and a soundtrack for pure enjoyment make this anime one I will not soon forget.

So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on ---% excess and shock-factoring like Elfen Lied. 
Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In ---- a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something. 
As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a toss away filler arc, that repeats its self until something finally happens after - episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it, and when it finally does it's a very clich&eacute;d horror blunder trick comprised of a very cheesy sound effect that sounds like they are crushing tomatoes, and a cheesy cut out that either goes red or black.   
This series seriously lacks suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.  
And then the story continues again and starts out the same, we're in the school house, they act like we don't know any of the character by now, and then some annoying detective shows up again to go over the SAME mystery we heard - episodes ago!  How many times do I have to be told the little girl's parents were ran out of the village because of a damming project and that the brother's bat has gone missing.   I feel like I'm watching Pokemon, with the same thing different day style it's done over the last -- years.   
The series can work up it's suspense and chill level especially with the chirping cicadas that provide an almost melodic atmosphere, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not?  Even when in my jumping through episodes and reading further spoilers, I find the series doesn't go anywhere else, it's a bad version of Ground Hog Day with out the comedy, and the Blair Which Project, with out the suspense.  
Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller.  The only time I have seen it work, was Madlax. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again.   
But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/-w-tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it. 
I can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for the general suspense lovers (Like me) who want suspense and less gore, you may want to avoid this one.  
Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.  The only thing decent about this show was the  opening theme.  The sound effects sound cheesy and really childish.  Higurashi is basically a suspenseful melodrama with out the suspense.

To sum up how I feel about this anime, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO/WHAT THE FUCK CHARLOTTE IS. Maybe I blinked and missed the part where they gave significant information an insignificant amount of screen time. Okay, I'm being sarcastic, they did mention it but not in a tasteful way. It's like a lot of events felt very sudden and were missing a strong build up. 
Story: -/--, The way this anime's plot played out made me feel as though I was unaware of certain important details that were crucial to the eventual plot development. It wasnt like the potential wasn't there, the idea that children are able to break beyond physical limitations so that they have hope to cope with their biggest struggles is a topic I would've enjoyed every bit of. However, the light hearted feel from the first few episodes are later twisted into a melodramatic tragedy. The lack of substance in the effect of the series as a whole might have been caused by the attempt to cover too many topics in a short interval. In the end, I think the plot only succeeded in shocking me as I never would've expected it to go that direction when I started it. Now don't get me wrong I didn't skip any of the episodes especially because everything is drawn so beautifully.  
Art: --/-- I would rewatch this anime just for the visuals alone. It is one of the most visually appealing pieces I've seen so far. I'm a huge fan of PA Works and their anime usually have excellent art. I especially love the scenes where you can see a view of the city or stars because the detailing is mezmerizing. 
Sound: -/-- I really enjoyed the soundtrack for this. Props to music that is actually soothing to the ears. It really relaxes me every time I hear the theme song. 
Character: -/--, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode as the protagonist had a bit of character but then charactor development is largely lacking. The anime features creative side characters but the main characters lack depth that would give them a memorable persona. Props to Nao and her music tastes though and she did have a background story.  
Overall: -/-- I can't say it was terrible because there were definetely parts that made me feel some type of way, but it all felt like they rushed to wrap up the series, thus events that wouldve been impacting were not displayed in a way that would make the audience feel the most out of what's happening.

this is the -st time i watched shounen ai anime nor i interested in this genre. so i'll try to give my honest point here. This is about love from the present & the past. 
The backstory is too long to be told (took ---ep or maybe the whole season). it depends on what you like. if you're originally is a shoujo person, you probably not enjoy much (considering love triangle until the end). but if you like drama, this is for you. the main character (tanmoku ki) also become so weak different from the -st season. the plot is lagging. too long for a backstory of tanmoku ki. the other main character (keika) become lesser. basically, this season is about the past love of tanmoku ki & shouken. also, there is the episode that keeps rewinding the same scenes.

Beastars is probably not quite what you're expecting. The premise and promotional posters may lead you to believe it's going to be a quirky rom-com, but I think it's best that one stifles any expectations they may have and just watch it with as little information as possible. If your curiosity gets the better of you, then maybe I can convince you here. 
Our animal friends at Cherryton Academy live relatively comfortable lives away from society at large. Within these walls, they experience intense study, a variety of clubs, and tender romances. Like our own schools, it reflects the transition from childhood to adulthood. This academy is host to a myriad of different animals that all live in various dormitories to suit their species. It's plain to see this world in which they live mirrors our own in certain capacities. Herd mentality permeates the student body and they become isolated into obvious cliques. The two most notable camps that these characters fall into? Carnivores and herbivores.  
There's a lot of moral ambiguity at play here and it challenges the viewer to see both sides of an issue. One of the central themes of Beastars is the growing tension between meat eaters and plant eaters. Carnivores are expected to be much more docile than their nature suggests. Their diet has been relegated to things like soy products and egg sandwiches. Signs of aggression toward herbivores aren't tolerated and any carnivore caught posing a threat is punished severely. As a consequence of this role reversal, many carnivores have grown resentful toward herbivores and it's caused an uncomfortable divide among the students of Cherryton. This self-imposed segregation is brought about by natural instincts and it makes for an intriguing story. It's rare to see animals from these creeds as anything more than acquaintances who associate with each other out of necessity. So what would happen if an attempt was made to break this divide? A chance meeting between a meek wolf and an assertive bunny may have the potential to shake up the entire school. 
We're introduced to a timid gray wolf named Legoshi. Legoshi is a modest and unassuming, but largely imposing figure in the stage crew of the drama club. The club itself is full of an eclectic mix of different animals that manage to put on successful plays, but the most notable one is the red deer Louis. As the premier actor, Louis is the pride and joy of Cherryton and is particularly fawned over by girls for his striking looks and charisma. He has a dominating presence and takes center stage in nearly every scene he's a part of. Yuuki Ono puts on a stunning performance and gives Louis's voice a thunderous sense of power. These two have a fascinating dynamic that greatly contrasts with their ordinary roles in the animal kingdom. Louis takes an interest in Legoshi and pushes him to be more involved with the club. As a direct result of this, Legoshi comes into contact with a feisty dwarf rabbit named Haru and everything soon changes. These three navigate their complicated school lives in a setting nature never truly intended. All of them have to fight against their natural roles as predator and prey. As a whole, the cast comes together to maker for one of the most compelling shows of its kind. 
A few words come to mind when I think of how to describe the art style and animation of Beastars. Crisp, vibrant, and lush stand out to me. The series utilizes some of the finest CG in a standard TV series that you'll ever see. Environments are colorful and really pop. The motions are fluid. It's honestly a joy to see when these moments are really fleshed out, like during an intense rehearsal. The attention to detail is positively charming. Different breeds stand out and even characters within the same species are noticeably unique. In recent years, it's relieving to see a studio that actually cares about the way that their works look and I think the staff should be commended for their efforts. The music and sound direction are excellent as well.  
To sum it up, Beastars is a lovely tale of forbidden romance, dreams, and growing up packaged together neatly in -- episodes. It's more than worth the price of admission.

I tried to like this. I really, really did. I was even sticking out for it upon its announcement because for all of the problems earlier iterations of SAO had, there was always a sense that, if the finer details were checked over and looked at in complete retrospect of what came before, it could be deservedly fun, inspiring or genuinely meaningful. A series deserving of the immeasurable hype phenomenon it generated. Escapism, blurring between actions of reality and fiction was always a thematic that separated the series from the many isekais this decade that followed in its footsteps, and something that held my interest in how it would be handled, but aside from arguably the Mother’s Rosario arc, this wasn’t given enough space in the narrative between all the superfluous anime tropes that seem to be there to draw the most general audience possible. Look no further than the original Aincrad arc, praised most by anime-only fans for its concepts, but forcibly rushed to completion when its author chose to submit a word limited contest draft as the first novel, compared to refining the fully story he wanted to make. 
Sword Art Online’s biggest problem is itself.  
Its writer, Reki Kawahara, keeps getting in his own way, and when he doesn’t, the anime eschews his vision. What he wants to get across is almost always clear, and there are effortful attempts, but with the anime’s focus on moving the plot forward rather than making details feel elaborately set, it ends up bringing down the entire experience to make watching the series weekly for the most part, feel like a slog of boring exposition attempting to cover up the poor pacing of external events. If something from earlier is justified, it can feel annoyingly retroactive. Even when Kirito himself is less a factor than in previous arcs, he is still partially to blame in the indistinct coverage of how this season adds to the themes of the franchise. 
General spoilers for the season below: 
The main premise of this arc is that Kirito, while on a date with his girlfriend Asuna, is caught off guard and stabbed to near death by one of the three Death Guns from the previous season. While in a coma, he ends up in the digital world of Rath, a system used for a military experimentation project where he must do..............................nothing in particular at no real urgency. There is a plot, and there is a goal, but for once they feel entirely separate from the tension. 
But I’ll get to that later. SAO, being as popular as it is, has mostly being met with snark and derision from people calling it the “worst ever” or otherwise exaggerating the flaws of it, so I think it’s fair to start off with the positives of this season, because contrary to what haters will tell you, they do exist. 
-. Production value and music. These have been consistent strengths of the SAO series throughout the years and generally, they still hold up here. The character models take on the new polished style from the Ordinal Scale Movie, and while not having as much animation (I’ll get to that), the look is maintained very well across all -- episodes of the show. If you compare to the original two seasons, there is a definite improvement, and while the architecture present isn’t particularly unique or standout, it is well presented. Likewise, Yuki Kajura’s music, while not her best soundtrack, still does what it can to set the mood for the quieter scenes and the action scenes, with a great new remix of Swordland to go along with it. Special mention to some of the opening moments of Episode -, and the fight in Episode --. Of the music outside of the show, the first OP and the second ED are the best ones and do have a good amount of catchiness and energy to them. 
-. Alice Schuberg, the arc’s new female lead. While it takes -- episodes in to actually really explore her as a character, and she looks a lot like Saber from the Fate series, the time we do have from then on with her sets her as probably the most consistent female lead in SAO so far. As of yet, she’s hasn’t been subjected to an endless supply of ass shots, her growth hasn’t been stunted by time skips, nor is her growth entirely for Kirito’s sake. Her arc of rejecting the corrupt system she’s been brainwashed under, wanting to reconnect with her old life and opening up on her feelings is adequately handled and leads to some of the stronger character moments this season. She also has one of the coolest weapons in terms of both design and animation; a space bending sword acting as moving protection with golden butterflies as weapons. It’s been put to effective use in the fights so far and has potential to be used further as the story moves along. 
-. Measuring Kirito’s power. Compared to say, the Phantom Bullet arc, some of the worst aspects of his character are toned down. He doesn’t start the series overpowered from the get-go, has actual struggles in several fights and even takes a few Ls in a couple of them. It gives a couple of the fights in the season more tension than previous ones. The existence of Eugeo also helps for his sake since the show is better able to balance the battles between the two of them rather than giving Kirito the entire spotlight. It doesn’t mean there isn’t still an annoying amount of contrived solutions to conflicts, but that’s more on the writing than him specifically. 
-. Actually building the villain. The arc’s villain, a Knight Templar dictator calling herself Quinella, has an established backstory and a defined reason for ruling the way she does. We know why she is the villain, we see the clear consequences of her actions on the world and she isn’t too laughable to be taken seriously compared to say, Sugou from ALFheim. She’s a product of an as of now unknown evil seed, but nonetheless she’s established properly, despite the fact that showing her attractive naked body on screen doesn’t work at all to be alienating for a series that in the past used naked bodies during bath scenes as fanservice. There are some good bits with her in the climax, even if the battle is a mere two minutes long. 
Unfortunately, that’s the positives out of the way. Now for everything else that really breaks this arc and saddens me given the inherent potential of a SAO story. 
The biggest problem that persists throughout the entire show is the immeasurable focus on exposition over every other element. Characters will abandon the idea of development, fighting, talking, world building, or anything else for the opportunity to talk in technical terms about topics that, while somewhat relevant, are not as important as what else could be focused on. Eugeo, the new male lead, has got family issues? No, that's not important. We need to talk about the villain’s plan and “Fluctlights” (the series’ pretentious name for digital souls in an indistinct coverage of AI vs humans) again. Knowing how that works is way more important that a main character's backstory. The exposition often brings the narrative to a screeching halt, especially in scenes where the heroes stop fighting the villain and exposition for a few minutes while the villain just stands around waiting for them.  
Exposition is something inherent in building a setting and establishing the plot. I understand the use for it. There are several shows that have still been entertaining despite or because of their exposition. But SAO Alicization’s exposition is not only incredibly frequent but boring and lacking in character. It’s frequent enough to where Episode - spends -- minutes just expositioning off vague terms about the setting, while half of Episode -- and nearly all of Episode -- are nothing but this flat delivery of the plot. Other episodes tend to tag nearly every fight with exposition that’s - times longer than the fight itself. While the old director was no exemplar by any means, he at least knew how to make fights seem varied and exciting visually with a lot of movement. Here, Yuki Kajiura puts in the effort, but this new director who directed some of the worst LN adaptations in recent memory like Mahouka and The Asterisk War, just cannot pull it off. So, when the OP makes you think you’ll be getting this epic fight, it’s usually just maybe two attacks apiece preceded and followed by ---- minutes of exposition.  
The framing device of the season also presents several issues this time around. The idea that Kirito’s exploration in this new world is happening while his real-world body is comatose could generate tension, but this alongside Kirito’s connection to the real world is poorly substantiated. In learning about this framing device, we, as the audience, know it is just a waiting game for Kirito to heal up and be back to normal. Until the very last episode, his actions in Rath have absolutely no consequences in the real world. None of that “die in the game die in real life” stuff here. He gets really hurt from time to time but we have no idea how his real body is taking it. There’s a two-year timeskip at one point, but unlike in Season - where it really was two years, we have no idea how much the time exchange is between the system and the real world which I think hurts the connection to the story. This framing device also separates Kirito from his past connections in this story. I don’t mind the reduced role of his entourage for the moment (even if Asuna, who SHOULD be important, has nothing to do right now), but he barely brings them up over what’s been at least two years. There was one moment Kirito thought of his real-world connections, but that was for a poorly animated fight that ended in a draw and had absolutely no effect going forward. Kirito cries more over the fact that flowers he planted were destroyed (that were contrivedly brought back anyways) than even the chance that he might NEVER see Asuna again being stuck for so long. I want to care, but the show refuses to let me with a framing device that undermines the events and severs past connections. 
Other old habits die hard, whether because of Kawhara’s own writing or the adaptation. Not only do we get another ridiculous rapey scene, but there’s a two-year timeskip rather than say, actually seeing Kirito and Eugeo train up to be better swordsman. They set off for the Capital and the next we see them, BOOM, two years pass, and they’ve already had a lot of training done. They could’ve at least done an FMA-- type thing by building character relationships prior to a timeskip but nope, nearly all relationships at the sword academy are shown after and as of now, doesn’t matter to anything since we know so little about them. If this was better in the light novel, good for Kawahara, but perhaps it should’ve been a cause for concern seeing how much got cut for the anime onlys. In this adaptation, the only purpose of the sword academy stuff, aside from telling us Kirito and Eugeo became better swordsmen offscreen, was to build two bullies as irredeemable rapey monsters, and paint two cute girls as victims of this. We don’t know much about them either, aside from one of them having a romance arc with Eugeo that goes absolutely nowhere. There’s also a lot of contrivances to make progress, like with Kirito seeing the “ghost” of Alice in Episode - lead him the right way, how Cardinal is introduced into the story specifically to ex Machina Kirito and Eugeo out of a scene, and how Kirito uses a completely unknown attack to one shot a late-game villain that returns him to his Black Swordsman coat for a bit. This attack is never referred to by name and never mentioned again.  
And it’s not like this progress has done well for the characters, as Alice aside, they range from passable to horribly flat. Kirito isn’t as overpowered as before, but aside from problems the framing device puts on him, he still has annoying moments, like one case where he retroactively Sherlocked his way to avoid being poisoned, or where he used a device he only had two of on a character he barely knew, rather than to potentially stop the villain and save Alice. The show puts him in the right for this by the way, and there’s not much of an arc for him this season either. Cardinal is actually pretty decent, even if the show’s use of her as an ex Machina isn’t for the best. The sword academy characters are barely developed at all, and among the antagonists, only Bercouli and Deusolbert are passable; the rest are just obnoxious. Fanatio’s only character trait is being ashamed of being a woman, which falls deaf when both the main villain and Alice, whom she knows personally, are also women, as well as there being no indication of gender division in the world. And Chudelkin’s only purpose is to ruin the tone and make rapey faces whenever possible until kill stealing at the end. 
Which leads us to the biggest wasted potential so far, Eugeo. There was a lot of potential for his character at the start. Being a guy partner to help balance Kirito out of the spotlight, there was a lot Kawahara could do with what he distinctly did not know about Kirito, his personal relationships with him and Alice as kids, his fighting ability, the idea that he has more innate fighting potential than Kirito, his unawareness of being an AI program and his romantic relationship to Tiese.  
Unfortunately, not one of these elements get to shine in this adaptation to let us in on his blank sheet personality. Perhaps improved in the light novel, but the anime should have better stood on its own. Him having more innate potential than Kirito is completely ignored later on, his sword training is told not shown, and anything the show tries to pull regarding his relationships with Kirito/Alice as kids, his family, or Tiese fall completely deaf because they received little to no focus. He didn’t even TALK to Alice in the present day, once. The show would rather go into long tirades of exposition than show a main character’s backstory! Near everything about him was entirely cut short by the show despite having more than enough time to act on all of it. They try their best to make up for it at the end, but it’s a bit too little too late. 
It’s hard to say whether I’m more annoyed or disappointed with how Alicization has been executed so far. Sure, some of the problems in the world, characters and framing device can be fixed going forward, but first impressions are everything and this series did not make a good one. The focus on constant exposition over all else, the disconnected framing device, and lackluster character writing drag it down more than needed, but it could’ve been avoided if Kawahara just knew what to focus on or the anime didn’t skim over the better parts, since his ideas are abundantly clear. The SAO franchise can theoretically explore a lot, but it almost deliberately gets written into corners. That’s something I’ve always given SAO over the many works that have almost no effort at all to act on their ideas, and though there’s that chance for the future with new elements coming in to make the second half an improved experience, this season’s quality suggests it won’t be without a wide range of caveats.

Do you want to see a worse mirai nikki? 
Like, mirai nikki gets shit on constantly; but god damn, at least it has an interesting premise and some cool character scenes. 
This has nothing. 
Props where I can give them, I liked the animation quirks they put on at times where characters will seem real and act as humans would, straightening their hair or clothes for example. Don't normally see that type of stuff and I appreciate it. Also liked the character clothes, they changed them up a bit which also contributed to making me buy more the whole series. 
Everything else, can't say the same. 
These characters are either bland to a fault, dense to a fault or a delightful combination of both (wost offender of this goes to saki). I had to convince myself she was high as a kite in every scene because I don't get --% of the things she does. 
Takizawa is a shallow copy of Yato. He is very dumb but everyone in the show will try to convince you he's not. The romance between the two is crammed in there and you're expected to swallow it up. 
Nobody else matters because they're not memorable or don't serve any purpose in the story. 
Talking about the story, what was that? The anime has one idea and tries to make a whole show out of it by sprinkling information that go absolutely nowhere and don't make sense. Btw, get used to having all information be shared in long speeches that will just make you even more confused.  
I stopped taking this show seriously since episode two, and just sat back and enjoyed it all. You can be quite amused between the exposition scenes when seeing these carboard characters interact with one another and how the story just spirals more out of control. Loved the ending, laughed for a minute straight. 
Little pet peeve, the chibi artstyle doesn't look good here at all. Please refrain from using unless you're in dire need for it. Thank you.

Story: Honestly, good animes aren't based on art but story - how their tale enthralls and awes viewers with a the story that lingers long after the end. This story was indeed interesting with the plant-apocalypse, robots and superhuman hybrids. Wait what!? Really!? And a volcano weapon!? It's like Saturday cartoons all over again but this time there's a twist! It's prettier. 
Art: The art is beautiful almost comparable to a Miyazaki film. The cg/anime hybrid was worked in well. Unfortunately the art begins to degrade as the movie goes on. In the beginning, they do a great job immersing the viewer in a fantastic new world but towards the end you almost always see lots of desert, metal walls, or tons and tons of green blurs (forest).  
Sound: The music for the movie is great. But like the art, it becomes more bland towards the end. The sounds used for gunfires, explosions and buckets are very well placed. 
Character: I've seen plenty of anime movies but this one is completely ridiculous. The character development here is close to non-existent. Halfway through the movie I was confused as to what drove the main character Agito to do what he did. Outside of the - main characters and the antagonist - the rest you don't even care for.  
Enjoyment: At first it was great. I was drawn in. As the movie went on however, I became more and more confused, frustrated and bored as to what was going on.  
Overall: It has great art and music, both of which are amazing at first but become poor at the end. The story and characters... don't even get me started. Oh, might as well. The story and characters sucked. Period. You can find a similar post-apocalyptic setting and pre-pubescent characters in other anime. However in other anime, you actually understand their motivations and their significance.

Story: While the story isn't anything complex, I really appreciated how each episode felt totally different. Usually when I watch anime, even if I like the series some episodes are either boring or piss you off, because of lack of progress. While watching Mob Psycho --- it was just pure enjoyment from my end. I totally LOVED the humor this show threw at me. I know that this show was written from the same author from OPM, I'm surprised that this show didn't receive as much hype as OPM.  -/-- 
Art: Art was amazing, how they put in manga styled art as well as webcomic art. To me Art was what really made this show funny and so exciting. Each episodes were so colorful and full of life. --/--  
Sound: Good music, idk what much to say. Sound was always on point and it always matched the mood of the scene or it was even amplifying it. -/-- 
Character: How they develop every character was just amazing. Unlike most other popular anime, characters in this show weren't one dimensional and showed multiple personalities or changed their attitude. Every character in the show has his/her personal quality and traits that differentiates them from each other, and the variety of characters were just purely amazing. --/-- 
Enjoyment: of course for this this is an easy --/-- 
I would recommend this show to ANYONE as it has very minimal fan service, with good plot, amazing humor, great art and characters.  
To me this show was the definition of anime Very colorful, while being immature at times also being mature with good messages.

It's my first review and the reason I'm writing it is because I'm honestly dumbfounded by the fact that NO ONE,so far ,mentions all these stories were recycled from previous seasons 
I think I watched Bakemonogatari in ---- or ---- and as I'm writing this it's ---- before Christmas but I can still recall a lot of these short stories, some more or less vividly and can't understand how no one else does. 
There's not need to watch Koyomimonogatari because anyone who is interested has most likely seen previous seasons. You can even see a difference in animation quality- it was left untouched, and therefore later episodes' animation is notceably better. 
Shortly put: no need to watch this. Better go rewatch full episodes.

Art: (-) The art wasn't bad, it was fair. Though I do have to comment on their ear shapes. It was bothering me the whole time.The characters were decent looking however. 
Sound: (-) The sound was a -. Like every other anime with good sound. The opening of the anime sounded very familiar. It was memorable. 
Character: (-) The main character was a good guy. But at times his personality confuses me. In the beginning, he had a tendency to transform into the opposite sex, but over the course of the series, he did not. His brothers were likable characters. However, I don't like the side characters very much. They try to give off an air of being friendly, but the words they speak don't match. (especially those from the Friday group).  
Enjoyment: (-) When I first found this anime, I thought it would be thrilling and exciting to watch, but over the course of the episodes, it was dull and getting gloomier by the episode. There wasn't very much excitement. There was only idle talk. Characters didn't develop very much and why the characters don't try to do things to make their surroundings better. The main character stayed quiet thru most of the anime. Though I do not know the rest since I only watched up till the -th episode. 
Overall: (-) 
Overall, it was not very enjoyable, though to some it might be, but compared to many other great anime out there, this seems to be quite overrated. If you like to watch an anime with no plot nor much development, perhaps this one is for you.

Story -: Rushed, tacky and completely cliche without anything new or fresh or exciting. It seems interesting but truly fails to deliver anything. 
Ar -t: The art style is nothing you haven't already seen before, not bad, but nothing special. 
Sound -: As far as the soundtrack goes almost the same applies to the art, except it is far more mediocre. At least be thankful it blends into the background so you don't even notice it. 
Character -: 
Asta, ""AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH......AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.....AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"". 
Enjoyment -: For there to be enjoyment, one must experience joy in even the slightest degree...I did not. I really wanted to enjoy this, and I searched hard to find something I could cling to, but this anime just didn't provide anything to keep me going. 
Overall -: If you can somehow manage to get over the voice acting and the complete lack of a decent plot, then you might enjoy watching colors move around on the screen, since there isn't much else here.

I have not seen a show like this in a long while. That's not to say it's good, mind you. I came away from [i]Gantz[/i] with mixed feelings that ultimately ended in dislike. The show follows a perverted, angry-at-the-world teenager who sees an old friend at a train station. They both witness a homeless man fall onto the tracks, and the friend jumps onto the tracks to save him, then yelling for his friend to help. For no good reason that I can figure out (unless it's peer-pressure), the cynic jumps onto the track to help. They save the old man, but are killed by a train, and transported to an apartment, where others who have just died seem to be gathered. 
I don't want to say more about the plot, but I do like the ideas behind it. The story told in [i]Gantz[/i] is interesting enough that it kept me watching it all the way through. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, especially in the latter four episodes or so. However, the ending left me very unsatisfied, and made no sense at all. I came away from the story ultimately with a sense of pointlessness. 
Of course, it doesn't help the show's case that the main character is utterly unlikeable, for me at least. He almost comes off as believable, but is taken too far to really be a believable character. 
The same rings true for most of the characters. They're presented as these people in this alternate Earth, but then taken just a little too far in their archetypes to be believable. This isn't necessarily a problem for most of the characters, except the one or two that just become annoying. 
This problem is compounded by the art design for [i]Gantz[/i]. Everything is drawn quasi-realistically, but retains enough of the fact that it's an anime that, again, it just becomes a little annoying, rather than giving the impression that I'm sure the people behind this show wanted it to. 
Voice acting for the series is, overall, decent. My only real problem with the voices was casting for certain characters, especially a major character, who ended up sounding weird at times. The VA work wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. 
My biggest problem with the show has to be the pacing. For the first few episodes, things go along somewhat slowly, but any time it comes to a scene where the characters disagree about something, they stand around for twenty minutes talking in circles about it. Everything seems like it's taking way too long, to the point where it became a game to guess what would happen episodes in advance, which isn't a fun game, because the answer is always, ""They're gonna talk about it for two episodes, and then they'll actually do [spoiler]."" 
But not only does it move really slowly, but any time stuff does start to happen, the viewer is constantly assaulted by the gory deaths of characters that I guess we're supposed to care about, but I didn't, and by scenes that almost make this show hentai, if not for the rest of the plot. 
That's pretty much [i]Gantz[/i] in a nutshell; nothing happens, then gore, then sexual scene, then nothing for a while, then a lot of talking in circles, more gore, and more nothing. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone. [i]Gantz[/i] is not worth spending the ten or so hours to watch the entire series. I give it a one out of five, because the only redeeming quality for the show was the interesting premise.

I'll clear some things up first, to get any subjectivity cleared up. 
I absolutely love jazz. I play bass guitar myself, not quite proffessionally but more than just a pasttime. 
I also adore most music anime, even if it's not quite a musical genre I like. I still enjoy K-On as well, even with what little focus on music it has. Mio best girl. 
That aside, I've rewatched Kids on the Slope recently, after rewatching Your Lie in April beforehand. 
This really cleared up some thoughts I had with both shows, either of them pointing out faults in the other or showing similar weaknesses. 
In that regard, I'll also write a review on Your Lie in April. I guess you can consider them linked in weird way. 
Now on to the actual review. 
What to expect: 
Your Lie in April is an anime set in a vastly underexplored era for the medium and most of what's in the show actually makes sense for the post-WW- period of Japan. 
In this setting, we learn about - main characters along with a handful of sidecharacters. 
The show touches on some of the issues of the time period, but it's by no means the focus and at most some setdressing. 
Musically, the show focuses on jazz. Our ragtag band seemingly preferring wilder afro american jazz than say, tamer french jazz of the similar period. 
Nevertheless, you'll find a bit of every variety of jazz, save for pretty out there stuff like bebop. 
Story-wise, the show'll treat you to romance and friendship amidst drama. 
The drama is, quite unusually for the music-anime genre, not even really focused on music, but instead mostly on romance. 
Now on to the breakdown. 
Story: 
The story really is massively underwhelming if you expected anything somewhat out of the ordinary. 
The setting doesn't hinder the story but it also doesn't help it along the way at all. None of the intricacies of the time period have a proper effect on the story, save for maybe the impending popularity of Rock'n'Roll in japan. 
The drama is plagued with the old problem of people just refusing to talk about things, which has been one of my biggest annoyances in anime since forever. 
Art: 
The art looks pleasant, it really does. They seem to have gone for a bit of a dated look on purpose for the setting, which works pretty well. It takes some time getting used to, but ends up being charming. 
Especially the muisic sequences are gorgeous, but with how few of them there actually are in this show, I really don't feel well rasing this score. 
Sound: 
The choice of music is good, but very safe. Still though, the arrangements are beautiful, which is to be expected of Yoko Kanno. 
The Leitmotif of Art Blakey's ""Moanin'"" is a particularly great choice with its hook that just stays with you. 
The OP and ED are pretty good for casual listening, but it seems like the creators were yet again too insecure to actually use the show's musical genre for the OP and ED. Why? You built the entire show around jazz, why's the OP gotta be some pop stuff? 
Character: 
The characters go hand in hand with the show's story. As in, they're really bland and forgettable. 
The entire cast is very archetypal with the exception of -, which are sadly just a B-plot. 
At the very least the chemistry between the main group is pretty endearing, if they're not having one of the dramatic episodes. 
Enjoyment: 
Especially with my rewatch in mind, I must say that the only real enjoyment I've gotten out of this show are the musical performances, which, I need to mention again, are supremely pleasant. 
Aside from that, the poor story actually started to remind me of some bad old pulp novels, which then ended up being a ""so blasé it's entertaining again"" state. 
Trying to find any closing words, I'd honestly just recommend tracking down the musical scenes if you're a fan of jazz and/or want to see some really slick animation. 
Aside from this one gimmick, as mean as it sounds, Kids on the Slop sadly has nothing special to offer, as it does nothing worthwhile with its more unique features.

Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu. 
With most sports anime, the pacing of the story is hard to bear. In some shows, a match can last nearly half a season. With Haikyuu, it never felt this way. Each episode had a succinct amount of storytelling and the pacing was perfect. From the training camps they attended, to the matches that were played, every episode was a thrilling ride that always managed to be satisfying. One of Haikyuu's biggest strengths is how it properly sets up each story arc with the necessary back stories to each character. This type of information provided is exactly why this show is so good. It gives you the “why should you care” for nearly every aspect of the show. Haikyuu also mixes the elements of a story masterfully. Comedy, action, shounen, it's all there and perfectly balanced. Comedy was put in at the right times and had me rolling on the floor on more than one occasion. The action is thrilling in the big matches and the shounen aspect of “improving” is so engraved in the viewer, it just feels so good to root for Karasuno.  The attention to detail in the story is by far one of the best of any shows I've seen and it truly makes for a great watching experience.  
Production I.G has done a great job with the animation for Haikyuu. The animation quality is top-notch and most importantly, consistent. In fast-paced action scenes, the animation becomes incredibly intense, but it's very well done and gives a much needed “oomph” for climaxes in the story. Character design is varied and unique as well. Far too often in other anime shows, the characters all look alike. Haikyuu does not experience this with its large cast of characters that are appealing and uniquely designed. 
Haikyuu's voice acting, background music and OST are, like the rest of the show, great. The OP and ED are fitting for the theme of the show. The background music in scenes are also utilized very well. Some other shows try to force insert songs in scenes that do not fit well but Haikyuu does not suffer from this. Haikyuu's OST is near perfect and manages to help emphasize the emotions experienced in the show. Google Haikyuu's OST and prepare to be blown away (or just listen to it while watching).  
The characters of Haikyuu are most definitely its strongest point. I briefly mentioned this earlier, but Haikyuu fully develops each character in the show. The characters all grow throughout the series. None of them are 'perfect' from the start and altogether gives it a certain type of realism. Most people like to root for the underdogs and that's essentially the same feeling you get from Haikyuu. There is no 'Gary Stu' as each person has their strengths and weaknesses. Even the seemingly perfect Oikawa Tooru has his own weaknesses in that he is not a 'prodigy' but someone who worked his way up. I also appreciated that each character in the show has an impact. For example, Yachi, the manager, is not someone who just stands on the sidelines cheering Karasuno on. Haikyuu shows you her back story as well as her perspective. This greatly adds to the storytelling and to her character in general. Same goes for Tsukishima. His backstory is fleshed out and tells us why he acts the way he does. Each character is important to the overall story and is truly a 'cog in the machine' for Haikyuu. 
My initial thoughts upon seeing the preview for the first season of Haikyuu is that I couldn't possibly find volleyball interesting. Now, -- episodes later, I can't fathom how I'm going to wait for the third season. Haikyuu is not 'perfect' and of course has certain elements like 'they can't be losing all the time' armor plot. But again, Haikyuu is a fictional anime with the sole purpose of entertaining you. In this case, it is very much about the journey, not the destination. If you only care to look at the small conveniences that a story may take, you'll miss out on everything else that makes it great. For me, Haikyuu was an enjoyable show that I looked forward to watching every Sunday. With fully developed characters that you can care about, a great OST and masterful storytelling, Haikyuu is worth your time as it is an excellent example of just how entertaining anime can be.

Sad girl stops being sad after people are nice to her for -- episodes.  
The anime is just too long, it's an episodic SoL in disguise. The core story of Chise and Elias' relationship and their growth as individuals doesn't justify more than a few episodes, so it ends up being heavily padded. The bulk of each episode is some inconsequential subplot that contributes little more to the overarching narrative than reaffirming what we already know about Elias and Chise so far. There's very low ""content density"", where only about --% of the ~--- minutes of total runtime is dedicated to progressing the plot and the rest is split between little subplots and hammering in Chise's mental state. This might be fine if the show embraced its episodic nature and put more thought into its subplots, but they are usually only shallow metaphors for whatever Chise is currently feeling, or contrived to create an opportunity for Chise to monologue about her feelings.  
Chise's story is itself endearing but overly simple. Ultimately she is a pure-hearted nice girl antagonized by sadistic weirdos, so there isn't a whole lot of depth to her character. She hasn't done anything wrong and doesn't have any real flaws, so she has no character arc to progress through - she only needs to accept that she's not a bad person. This isn't exactly an applicable moral story, since real people aren't innocent, perfect, and only sad because evil people traumatized them; real people are flawed, do less-than-good things, and must self-improve to feel better. There is some tension between her and Elias, but usually in the form of one of them being broody and refusing to communicate which does less to create actual drama than it does to insert fake tension and prolong the story, since it never amounts to anything significant. 
It's just too slow and unengaging. The setting and subplots aren't given the attention they deserve, and so they end up feeling like padding that stretches the story thin instead of an engaging world to explore. The emotional core is simply that a perfect girl is sad because she was bullied in the past, and she eventually realizes there's nothing to be sad about and stops. It could easily be condensed to a few episodes, which it is in the OVA's, so just watch those instead.

Kekkai Sensen & Beyond or Blood Blockade Battlefront & Beyond or BBB & B is back! (That's alot of B's) 
The very first thing LA would mention about this second season is the absences of Rie Matsumoto, the director of the first season who brought that zany flair she added to Kekkai Sensen that will be sorely missed in this season but nonetheless, this season helmed by Shigehito Takayanagi (Director of Dagashi Kashi and both season of The World God Only Knows) tries to emulate Rie's vision in his own way as well as pay respects to Rie all into this second season with great results. 
For one, Kekkai Sensen's episodic nature is back and takes a more character focused narrative this season by bringing us perspective from the various main characters of Libra and giving us their daily lives of them. 
The funniest thing is, many of the episodes even pays homage to media references (which is probably Yasuhiro Nightow's influence, the author of Kekkai Sensen), from paying homage to Batman, Akira and Godzilla among others. 
Character-wise the development of the minor cast of Libra was a good step, from Gilbert F. Altstein, Chain Sumeragi, K.K, Zed and Steven A. Starphase. LA's favourite would be a tie between K.K and Chain's episodes and involvement in several of the off-handed non main character focused episodes. LA felt that Klaus didn't get as much as the rest of the cast though he was linked to a Demon Hospital episode that had at least showed his resolve before Hellsalem's Lots actually became a thing. Now Leo's actual character focused episode doesn't show up until the final - episodes of Beyond and it involving Michella, you know it was gonna get serious. Before all that it hinted us the audience that Leo wanted to get rid of the curse of his All Seeing Eyes and culminated into the final episodes into something as bombastically intense as it did, with a villain Leo faces who surpasses him in terms of supernatural power. 
Animation and voice acting wise, it has all the feel of the first season, with the crisp and zany battles that Libra goes through and all the alien nature of the anime taken as normalcy. The animation done by Bones is once again great and consistent all throughout from both the first season and this one. Voice acting wise, LA thought Yuu Kobayashi and Ai Orikasa got to use more of their acting chops during this season and it paid off. Daisuke Sakaguchi who voiced Leo is his normal yet zany self and his over-exacerbated reactions are great as always. What's great for the voice cast for LA would be Nana Mizuki as Michella and in voicing Leo's kind hearted sister (LA says this as Nana usually voices the badass character) but LA has this thing with Nana Mizuki where LA can't displace Nana Mizuki from Tsubasa from Symphogear, but nonetheless with all this rambling, the voice cast is expected greatness. 
So if you thinking with the change of directors and change of plot focus would deter you from liking this season of Kekkai Sensen, LA would say you can rest easy as it still has the same vibe to the original and given the character development to Libra actually working it's own advantage, the same animation studio pegging this season and the voice cast being as amazing as always, Beyond quite honestly eviscerated any notion that this season would go down on the wayside with what passion, homages and emulate the first season to this season own unique greatness!

Seisouhen (Samurai X: Reflection) takes place after the TV show of Rurouni Kenshin, but in the style of Trust and Betrayal. The story is sort of an alternate-ending to the manga, and shows Kenshin struggling to bear his guilt 
The art style is very well done, and the animation quality is top-notch. The background art is beautiful.  
The music and sound are delicious, especially the music, which is some of the most emotionally satisfying I've ever heard. It is all orchestrated, very well composed. 
The main problem in this is the story. The script is quite frankly terrible, and the story suffers from how it is told. It mainly consists of multiple flashbacks highlighting emotional scenes from the anime and manga. However, since fans of the anime and manga won't like the changes, these scenes are left as melodramatic and confusing to the audience that would appreciate this OVA more. There is a certain lack of subtlety to the emotions, and they often come across as forced. 
For fans of the TV series and the manga, this is not recommended. The characters are very different than they are depicted in the show and manga, and the storyline is altered. This OVA is more suited for fans of the acclaimed first OVA, Trust and Betrayal.

There are two kinds of people: those who watch mystery as comedy, and those who watch comedy as mystery. 
Mayoiga is the one responsible for it. 
-------- Story (-/--): 
What would happen if a bunch of troubled people who want to run away from their life come together just to be lost and trapped in a mysterious village?  
Apparently, Mayoiga gives you two answers: 
-: The Mystery and Drama 
It's quite good mystery to be honest, it makes you really curious about what actually happens there. Each episodes often ended with cliffhangers, and through out the series you will find yourself wtf-ing your screen. What actually happens next are often pretty shocking. However, don't expect any foreshadowing. This is the kind of mystery where you don't find any foreshadowing but the revelations keep on surprising you. 
The Drama is... Well, some are cliche, some are rather interesting. 
Then, at the end of the series, it tries to convey a kind of messages to the audience through the psychological drama, although a crappy one.  
Regardless, I personally like the ending, it's not the boring optimistic happy ending, neither it is a completely bad ending.  
All of those mentioned aspects would make a pretty good anime, if only you can ignore the other face of Mayoiga... 
-: The Laughs. 
There's a good chance you will look at Mayoiga as the ""it's so bad that it's good"" kind of anime. 
There's some reasons you would laugh from this anime:  
First, because those people are a group of not so logical people, how the characters react with some incident and interact with each other are often so weird and funny that you can't hold your laughs.  
Second, is development that doesn't make sense, or just plain forced that it seems so funny. 
Third, is awkward things which the show tries to tell in a serious way, but turns out to be so hilarious. Or, trying too hard to be unique, but ended up being awkward. 
For example (minor spoiler) : A monster that ended up remind you of 'Digimon' and 'Thomas and friends', the monster should be scary but looks hilarious instead. Example for the later is a detective who constantly and literally check extra fat in her stomach whenever she think. Like, why? 
Forth - is the plus, and actually related to the first point - is that some characters gives you rather catchy lines (in a hilarious way) frequently, like a constant buzzkill, which is very quotable or really worth for meme.  
Now, I'm not even sure myself anymore if the show coincidentally making it so hilarious or the creator actually trying to put some funny aspect in it. 
So is this 'laughs' part makes the show worse or better? Personally, I found it adds the enjoyment. lol. 
Overall Story: 
Let's check the whole story from the start. The first episode gives a solid feels of mystery and horror, perhaps you will expect some gore. Knowing the background idea, this series could easily promise a crazy and chaotic anime (in a good way). Which is why people has such expectation: A mysterious chaotic bloody massacre, or at least a kind of like Danganronpa. 
But unfortunately, that's a wrong expectation. 
Instead, it started as mystery and tried to graduate more toward psychological drama at the end. 
Considering the background idea which it started and the final idea which it tries to graduate (which both are actually great ideas), Mayoiga is a perfect example of an anime with great idea but very poor execution - ended up somewhat hilarious. 
-------- Characters (-/--): 
- -- characters. I'm not even sure if I can remember everyone correctly.  
- The big number of characters create awkward-paced dialogues. 
- The character development feels rushed and forced.  
- Most are stereotypical, few are quite original. 
- Wrong expectation is: They all have the same amount of role. The truth is: Some has major role, some has minor role, some just being there to make some laughs aspect in the series, some are just addition to the number - perhaps so that it feels realistic enough to have enough member (-- person) which make that fishy trip seems less fishy.  
- There's around --- characters that has no depth nor has any purpose to exist in the story. Perhaps their sole purpose are just to be the normal character that doesn't stand out, But the fact that they looks kind of unique, make us think that they're wasted. What's really wasted is when we think they're interesting but they actually don't have any role and we never get to know more about them.  
- There's a lot of characters that until the end, we never know their dark past and why they're there trying to start over their life. Some people might say that the series clearly doesn't have enough time to do the right thing for the characters. Heck, even some pretty important characters doesn't have clear background story, meanwhile some random characters has clear back story. Regardless, at least we want to know everyone's story, no matter how short. But we never get it from this show.  
- As mentioned before, the characters often make some weird/stupid actions and comments. Don't blame them for being illogical/retarded or accuse it as a bad writing. After all, that's exactly what the story is. They're troubled people whose soul/psyche hurt by their own life that they want to start over a new life as a new person, but unfortunately they are trapped in that panic anxious situation (albeit the anime show it with kind of awkward slow-paced mystery). Thus, It would be more irrational if they all are rational in their positions.  
- The good thing is: the characters cast serve a fairly good mystery. The one you think is suspicious is actually just a red herring. The one you think doesn't have important role is actually a very important character toward the end - sort of like that. 
-------- Music (-/--):  
Opening is catchy and has a kind of dark feels. 
Ending gives you the mood of hopelessness,  
and the ""unlucky hippopotamus"" song is rather funny but disturbing.  
There's this eerie soundtrack that reminds me a lot to a soundtrack in RPG that always there whenever I'm in a dungeon and near the boss room, which is nice especially when it plays in the last episode near the end of this anime.   
the rest is... well, they don't catch my attention, to be precise, they're boring and bland.  
The worse thing is, there's this part where it's showing a dangerous panic scene, and I'm pretty much sure I hear a music that sounds like soundtrack for comedic drama. I laughed despite what I see in the screen.   
The thing is, sometimes this show will give you weird experience, since there's a chance you will be laughing while an eerie soundtrack plays in the background. Weird. 
-------- Art (-/--): 
I can't really give any comment here. Everything is average, but nothing is really boring or plain.  
The character has diverse design and good.  
But some of the monster looks strangely laughable.   
-------- Conclusions:  
Mayoiga is a strange anime - in a funny way. It's hard to find something as strange as this. 
A fairly good mystery with hilarious things, the characters are done wrongly, and graduate as crappy psychological drama. 
Try it if you still not sure, you will definitely know if you're interested to see it until the end through all the strangeness or just can't stand it.

Katanagatari started as a light novel series by Isin Nisio. Who's written nothing else that I'm familiar with. He wrote some novelizations for both Death Note and xxxHolic, but I'm only familiar with the originals for those two and novels based on established series tend to vary a lot in quality. The anime adaptation was handled by the relatively new White Fox studio. They were behind both the Jormungand and Steins;Gate anime, so that could be a good sign. Then again, every studio tends to do some good and some bad work so this could be the first anime they've done that I dislike. Only one way to find out.  
The story follows a martial artist, who incorrectly refers to himself as a swordsman because this anime doesn't know what a sword is*, named Shichika. He lives with his sister in exile on an island. That ends when a woman named Togame shows up and asks Shichika to accompany her on a journey to collect twelve deviant blades. He agrees because he's fallen in love with her for no adequately explained reason. Did I mention he knows her for all of thirty minutes at that point? The story follows their journey to wade through a massive sea of exposition in order to collect the blades. This anime breaks the most important rule of story telling, show, don't tell. There's very little that happens with any bearing on the actual plot. The episodes are roughly fifty minutes long with most episodes using three minutes for the themes, eight minutes for action sequences, five minutes for plot relevant content and thirty four minutes for long stretches of exposition. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that one episode has a twenty minute stretch of dialogue that's nothing but the characters expositing over plot points. Because... showing the information in a natural way would've taken too long? One of the most inexcusable scenes happens in the middle of a fight scene. The characters just stop for more than five minutes so that one can exposit about her backstory. Then there's the narrator, whose only purpose is to waste time by telling you where they are, which they invariably mention in their exposition anyway, or to spoil what's going to happen in the next episode thereby killing any tension before it even has a chance to build. Smooth. The only real exception is the last episode, which spends most of its time with action sequences and a scene where someone, I won't spoil who, dies for fourteen and a half minutes. The worst part is that there's someone around who could've tied a tourniquet or something but prefers to spend the time crying because the first character is bleeding to death. Because.. death is more tragic if there's someone guilty of criminal negligence. The biggest issue that comes out of the whole thing is that it's boring. Stretches of dialogue can be interesting, but they barely have any actual dialogue. Most of it is incredibly stilted exposition, which isn't interesting. Then there's the romance, which never evolves beyond an attraction that comes out of nowhere. Nothing interesting is ever done with it, rather like the anime as a whole. The attempted comedy is so lacking in actual humour that it can be difficult to tell whether something is supposed to be a joke or it's just stupid. Then there's the ending, which features an anti-climax followed by abject stupidity.  
Then you have the characters. First you have Shichika himself, who calls himself a sword because he formed a club with Gundam --'s Setsuna for people who think they're inanimate objects. He has very little in terms of personality. He's pretty much defined by being stupid, hitting things and falling for random strangers. He's your typical big dumb hero character. Then you've got Togame, one of those characters who's supposed to be clever but never acts clever or demonstrates any intelligence whatsoever. She can be recognised by yelling a lot, falling over, blushing and hitting Shichika while yelling ""cheerio."" She's a pretty typical tsundere character, except with fewer dimensions. There aren't any interesting characters in this. They just fill their role, spout exposition and then stay stagnant or die. The worst part of it is that they try to have tragic moments, but they've never given you any reason to care about any of the characters so they just fail.  
Now for the art. I actually have a few positive things to say about it. The first is that there are some really nicely drawn backgrounds. The second is that the weapons, whether they're actually swords or not, are nicely designed, mostly. Now back to giving discredit where discredit is due. The character designs in this are horrible. The eyes are just off and convey no emotion other than dull surprise, and they show up in spite of being covered by hair on several occasions. The noses appear when the characters are in profile and vanish entirely when they're shown head on. White Fox does know that noses have depth, right? The characters really do look like badly made plastic dolls. The sad thing is that they try to have fan-service by giving Togame the occasional bum shot. Yeah, this art style doesn't work for that. The animation in this is frequently lazy. There are several cases where they just hold on the same image for no reason. The fight scenes are exceptionally bad. The characters are drawn so they're almost never actually coming into contact with one another and there's one fight scene where they play the same animation three times in a row.  
The music is another thing that I'm going to give some actual praise to. The music is well done. It could've made it in a decent anime. Then there's the voice acting. This is another anime where no one seems to be trying. I know that several of the major seiyu can act. Tamura Yukari, Tomatsu Haruka, Okiayu Ryotaro and several others are skilled at their craft but none of them seem to be putting any effort into their performances. Although, to be fair, there are very few people who could sound natural while delivering all of that exposition.  
The yuri factor is a -/--. This has no yuri.  
The final rating for Katanagatari is a -/--. There's a pretty clear lack of effort on the parts of everyone involved. The story is mostly told through tedious exposition. Character development is absent. The fight scenes, and most of the art in general, are just poorly done and none of the seiyu seem to be trying. In the end, Katanagatari is by far the most boring anime I've ever seen and the few scenes that kind of work aren't worth sitting through the exposition for.  
* They refer to Kunai as shuriken and every weapon, from guns to an android, as swords. They even refer to some non-weapons, like a suit of armour, as swords.

This is the first time I actually write a review, so please forgive me if I write it in a bad way. Also, this is purely based on my opinion. 
Despite reading the manga, I dropped this (for now, maybe I'll continue once it's finished airing) because so many things were wrong with this it wasn't funny anymore. 
Story: 
Pretty much not existing at all. The characters lose sight of their goals and every --th / --th episode (This includes the ""old"" Fairy Tail as well) they suddenly remember it. ""Oh, right, we were looking for our dragon parents who vanished."" 
The ""story"" is made out of single arcs which almost always don't have some kind of connection at all. One of the most serious problems Fairy Tail has, is seriousness. Of course, comedy is nice and all but sometimes the comedy is misplaced. ""Oh, we're trapped here and might die because we can't get any food - How about the girls strip and wear bikinis / sexy underwear so that the men will release us."" I know Fairy Tail is infamous for its fanservice, and I am a fan of it as well, but Mashima should know when he should add fanservice and when not. 
Battles: 
The most important part of a Shonen anime and I almost always enjoy them. 
But not here. I am a tolerant watcher that can tolerate minor logic errors or slight friendship power-ups since nearly every Shonen has something like that. But Fairy Fail is overdoing it. Let me take one of the fights from this series as an example: 
Rufus: 
""I can use ancient magic, no one can beat me, I have all the magic in this LIBRARY and can even use ANCIENT / LOST magic nobody else can use. OH, I can also dissolve the magic of my opponent so that he can't use his magic anymore. I am SOOO gonna win this fight."" 
Gray: 
""I was being pwned by but thanks to my nakamas I can now counter the magic that screwed me up - seconds ago."" 
This is just not okay. In the end it all comes down to opinions here but this fight was the pinnacle of stupidity. 
Characters: 
The characters are almost always stereotypical (Shounen) characters that can mostly be summed up with one or two words. They also don't get any major character development (If we exclude Gray and Erza, that is. (Then again, we only learned about their pasts. I doubt this can be called ""character development"", Mashima just seems to like these characters so he decided to give them some depth.)) which is very important in a Shonen anime. After --- episodes Natsu is still the same idiot as in episode - that likes to show off. Nothing changed at all. 
Sound: 
Outstanding / Awesome / Superb. 
Easily the best part of the whole anime. The medieval soundtrack fits perfectly and is one of the best out there. 
Art / Animation style: 
Many people complain about it but just as many people like it. The new animation style resembles the manga and is pretty damn good in my opinion. The character designs are now much better. 
Enjoyment: 
I wouldn't have dropped the series if I enjoyed it, right? 
Despite having enjoyed the first season, I can't bear to watch this one. I don't know what happened but it pains me to watch it. 
Conclusion: 
It's probably a good Shonen anime if you didn't watch many animes yet, good thing for newcomers. If you just like me prefer animes with some depth this isn't a series for you.

A horror anime that's truly scary? Yes. I don't know about anyone else, but the last horror anime I was scared of was 'Another'. I like most horror animes, but that doesn't mean I was necessarily startled by them. This one succeeded in having me on the edge of my seat, however.  
The opening and ending: Before I address what's so scary about this anime, I'm going to rip apart the components. The opening is catchy, well animated, right for the theme of the series despite it's given genre, and symbolic. 
The music: Honestly, there is a lack of soundtrack, but that's genius! The scenes in this series that are intimidating are made so because of the lack of music. Everything is withdrawn, there are only the characters and their terrified expressions to creep us out. Don't be mislead, however, when there is a soundtrack it is used lawfully, but I personally believe it can be easily neglected.  
The characters: The characters are likeable, and even the craziest ones I felt remorseful for (you have to watch to find out what I mean by that). They're also reliably smart, for once, and their teamwork is rather enjoyable to observe.  
The animation: it has a unique design - at least nothing I've seen - and the characters look individually diverse. You can really distinguish the characters from each other concerning their expressions, personalities, hairstyles and body languages.  
If you want to be on the edge of your seat --/-, watch this anime and savour it!

This review is brought to you by Mister Donut(R) 
Nisemonogatari is the sequel series to the Bakemonogatari series. This installment largely retains the same artstyle and art direction as the previous series, so I won't be going through them here. Instead, I will discuss on the other elements of Nisemonogatari. 
Nisemonogatari focuses on Araragi's - sisters, both of which make up for the main focus of each half of the series. Unlike Bake, each episode does not focus exclusively on each sister, instead taking time to reintroduce previous characters. However, Nise does not handle this quite elegantly, aside from Senjougahara, most of the other characters reintroduce are unneeded and feel like unnecessary padding to lengthen the series. It's filler and at times it's quite uncomfortable to see Araragi act in a flanderized manner than his previous incarnation in Nise.  
The two sisters aren't nearly as interesting as the previous cast. Both of them being fairly annoying and one of the most difficult moments to sit through in the whole anime were the awful brother-sister almost-incest moments in the series which just panders to the creepy fans who enjoy this sort of nonsense. The justifications for these moments are cringe-worthy (but one near the end is so bad it's hilarious). These scenes are completely unnecessary and add nothing to the whole story while alienating viewers who just want to enjoy a simple comedy. 
Speaking of fanservice, the whole series is rifle with unnecessary sequences of fanservice. To the point where it becomes very uncomfortable to watch. This reviewer personally couldn't stand Episode - of the series at all due to the absolute vacuousness of the whole episode in question. It's absolutely disgusting and borders on Hentai. While Bake did have its fair share of fanservice, they were mostly brief and didn't interrupt the pacing of the story. 
Nise's strongest point that differs it from Bake has to be it's two newly introduced characters, Kaiki and Kagenui. While Meme's absence from the series is felt early on by the viewer, these two make really interesting adversaries to Araragi and Friends but are characterized and written so well that any scene where they appear in is a joy to behold. Arguments between them and Araragi are especially fun to watch, though Araragi's childish and immature delusions can get the better of the scene and make certain scenes cringe-worthy to sit through. Still, Kaiki and Kagenui (Kaiki especially due to a larger presence) are easily the best characters in the series, largely due to at times rather clever dialogue that don't wear out their welcome. Indeed, the adult characters in the Monogatari series are very much some of the best characters in the franchise. (then again there's origami man from Tsugimonogatari, but that's for another review) 
All in all, Nisemonogatari is not worth being a worthy successor to Bakemonogatari. However, of one decides to watch this series, this reviewer would recommend that one skips the first few episodes of each half, at least until the respective antagonist of each half is introduced.

Very well done anime. Interesting story, great character development, cool action scenes and overall enjoyable anime. 
It's a ""remake"" of the Osamu Tezuka's Dororo. Haven't seen the original anime nor read the manga, but this anime is fantastic. But not always. 
The start of the anime is awesome, I was hooked, demon child born without limbs, skin and other body parts. Demons. Ghouls. Blind killer priest. Just awesome. 
But what started to frustrate me was the fact that the episodes didn't seem like they connected.  
In one episode they killed this ghoul or demon and were somewhere. Next episode they're somewhere else. The next episode they were again on a totally different place a killed another ghoul. 
And so on. 
It was enjoyable but didn't hold me so well. But the second half of the anime? Hell yeah! 
The second half is more fluent and connected. The episodes pretty much start where the other one ended and they're a bit more enjoyable. 
Also flaming horse. Demon eyes. Man eating sharks. Cannibal guy. Just hell yeah. 
By this review It migh seem like I didn't enjoy it as much to give it a -, but this anime evoked some feelings I've never felt before. I've seen many anime, felt many things. But this was a completely new thing. 
Just recommend it. Go watch it! 
Story -/-- 
Art -/-- A bit different, kind of old school, not really, don't know how to explain it 
Sound -/-- Didn't really like the voice of Hyakkimaru (The first opening is so gooooood) 
Characters --/-- Nice interactions, backstories, good development, empathic actions, likeable main characters Dororo and Hyakkimaru 
Enjoyment -/-- Just because of the bad continuity of some episoded

A great anime if you like some adventure and some romance. 
A cute fragile protagonist turns into a strong woman who fights for what she believes in. 
Alongside some beautifully coloured side characters, this anime makes for an amazing ride and I enjoyed every part of it. 
Sad to say there isn't a second season, but if it were to come out I would be thrilled to see what happens next. 
But I definitely recommend this anime, it's a bit more for the younger viewers out there but even so I still found it to be entertaining and exciting. 
NO SPOILERS, just go watch it :)

ahhh.. so the summer season is now over. there's a reason why ZnT achieved the number one spot for summer anime season (via YT at SenpaiCubed). 
This anime started out with a bang. With amazing artwork and outstanding video calibration, the viewers sense a stronger bond while watching the anime. It's almost as if a camera man had been filming the events in this anime even though it's just animated. What i mean is, the camera angles were stunning, and at times, the camera angle would seem shaky to add a more realistic touch. 
In the beginning of the anime, we start out with terrorists trying to terrorize the civilians go Japan. Simple enough, you think? NO! This anime went much deeper than that. Without spoiling, let's just say that the plot only thickens after the first episode. With new characters added, it enhances the - main characters' development. At first, they may seem evil, but deeper into the anime, we see their true motive. 
The story is a -: 
A very good set up with engaging battle of the minds (similar to Death Note). 
Any anime viewer likes being blown away as we see the main detective, Shibazaki attempt to solve Sphinx's riddles. 
At first, I thought the whole anime would be Shibazaki vs, Sphinx, but boy was i glad to be wrong. 
Art is a solid --: 
As stated before, from camera angles to simple reflections in glass, MAPPA hit all the good spots 
Sound is also a --: 
the OST was a very strong point for this anime. It enhanced the action scenes to a much more sophisticated level. I felt a sense of Hans Zimmer while watching this anime. Similar sounding vibes to Dark Knight X Inception...haha 
Character is a -: 
At first, we had a our typical genius protagonist, an even smarter detective, and of course the girl that everyone hates (but I personally love Lisa...so kawaii)... 
But anyways, the characters were outstanding. The two characters in Sphinx, - and -- actually had a motive for destruction. It was not a typical (revenge on the world) BS. It actually had a purpose, they wanted to convey their message. To many, they looked like terrorists, but really they were much more than that. 
Shibazaki was also a very entertaining character. A detective that actually understands the people he is going after. He goes trough slumps along the way, but in the end...well you'll see when you watch the anime. 
Enjoyment is obviously a --: 
Every time I would watch this anime, the episodes flew by. I was hooked right from episode - to the end. I highly recommend watching this. I am not OVERhyping this show. It truly deserves the honor I'm giving it.  
Overall, i give this anime a --: 
Although this anime is not my most favorite anime of all time, but it is definitely going to be the highlights of anime ----. It definitely serves a right to be ranked this high. The anime had a mission and it did well. It thoroughly entertained its viewers. it Entertained me enough to actually make such a long review. 
Well if you have read this far, I'm glad you read my review. This anime is one of the few rare gems I will always cherish out of all the tons of anime I have seen. 
Thanks for hearing me out. 
;)

I never really gave the sports anime a chance, but after watching the first  
I couldn't help but watch the second. Of course, that lead to the third season. 
Now, this anime isn't what I would call a realistic anime, but the story and art was amazing, along with the music and humor. The characters, each, has their own unique person  and abilities, and especially the main characters have. 
But the third season seriously took my breathe away, the last episode was worth waiting for.  
What I liked the most was the brotherhood and abilities of the main characters. 
The hitstory between the GOM was very interesting. 
Like a bit of drama, competition, hot main characters, this is something I recommend.  
Amazing work.

In this - episode series, Densuke Mifune is a high school student who stumbles upon the love of his life, Chiharu Shinomone, and by stumble, I mean they bumped into each other and the first thing he stumble was her enormous F-Cup (yes, F-Cup!) breasts and so, he is forced to join the Eiken Club, where he's surrounded by many girls, also with enormous endowments. 
Densuke is mostly what I mentioned about Koukin. He get aroused by pretty women but he gets nervous and fidgety. That's mostly it. All the other characters basically have no characteristics besides getting Densuke to sexually grab them and arouse them. Basically, it's man rape and he doesn't enjoy it that much. Also, what's it called when you take something but it gets out of hand? 
Oh yeah, it's OVERKILL!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Why in the hell does....a -th grade girl.....has breasts the size of fucking basketballs? Why the purple-haired girl does only seems to eat only phallic-shaped foods? The bungee-jumping scene? That falling down scene which seems like Paul WS Anderson directed this? (Yeah, I'm letting Zack Snyder slide this time.) The yogurt slide? The chocoslide? Eels up the @&#*$! ? That sister of Chiharu whose mission in life is to get Densuke to fuck her? Everybody has to flash their asses? We get it!! You are fan service but there is something called SUBTLETY and nobody in here seems to know this. 
For terms in all areas of animation, music, and especially both voice acting, let me just say this is the worst example of those: The animation is either being re-used for some occasion, the scenes of the ramen and yogurt that’s made to look like jizz…..yeah, that’s possibly from all the animators, creator, writer and the director. It’s either used for comedic effort and yet, it’s not funny at all, just shock for shock and it turns out lame.  
The music is very forgetful, yes, they have beginning and ending songs but did you really remember those right out of the gate? The dub done by Media Blasters and using Arvintel Media Productions for the ADR work……big fucking dumb mistake as they are completely incompetent with the worst voice acting from voice actors who are actually good and yet it breaks my heart hearing Stephanie Sheh (under a different name by the way) voicing Chiharu as I know she has done better voice roles in her career. Hell, most people who watched and reviewed Kanokon know the dub voice acting was terrible.

Sword Art Online... It's okay, nothing special or spectacular. I've watched the whole thing, and will watch the next ones, but it's more of a guilty pleasure show than anything else. 
Story: - 
The concept is great, who doesn't want to see what people do trapped in a VR, the concept is what hooked me. I'd have to say that the first -- episodes were the best of this show, and they were average at best. Later on there are some points that get... uh, uncomfortable. Not the best, but still not bad. 
Art: - 
I liked the art, it was pleasant to look at. 
Sound: -- 
This is where the show really shines, the openings and endings were fantastic and I still listen to them, from time to time. LiSA did an amazing job with the first opening. The songs succeed in getting you pumped, even if the show is mediocre. The voice acting (dub) was okay. 
Character: - 
Usually dramatic cardboard cutouts of people. But not horrible. 
Enjoyment: - 
It's a guilty pleasure show, that's all I have to say here. 
Overall: - 
Not bad, not good, enjoyable enough to watch, but not rewatch (except for the openings and endings, those are endlessly rewatchable).

There are many anime that have the ability to bring one to tears, for any number of reasons. Barefoot Gen, Grave of the Fireflies, Clannad: After Story, Air, Ushiro no Shoumen Daare, etc, etc, etc, are but some of the titles that have tried to make the audience sympathise with their tales, some with more success than others. 
Where Flanders no Inu (or, to give it it's correct moniker, A Dog of Flanders), differs from those stories though, is that it's all been done before... 
For those of you who don't know, the story known as ""A Dog of Flanders"" was originally written by Ouida (the pen name of English novelist Maria Louise de la Ramé), and was first published in ----. For over --- years the tale has captivated the hearts and minds of audiences the world over, and has been adapted for TV and movies no less than - times. The anime movie itself is an adaptation, not only of the novel, but of the TV series as well, with both the TV anime and this movie having the same director (Kuroda Yoshio).  
The tale, for those of you who don't already know the story, is set in a small town called Hoboken, near the city of Antwerp in Belgium, and is about a young boy named Nello, who has lost his mother, and comes to the town to live with his Grandfather. One day, Nello finds a dog that has been almost beaten to death. He decides to care for it, and calls it Patrasche. 
The story is very much in keeping with the novel and, although it's far more abridged than the TV series, it still maintains the essence of the tale. A Dog of Flanders is not simply about love and friendship against the world, it's also a social commentary on how the rights of man seem to work against a scale called money - something which isn't really an uncommon theme, but there's a reason this story is called a classic. The plot makes for pretty powerful reading, however the transfer to anime has served to enhance the story in several ways, the most obvious being accessibility. Like Barefoot Gen and Grave of the Fireflies, Flanders no Inu makes the inequities and personal trials, triumphs and tragedies that little bit harsher than normal by giving them a ""cartoon"" setting. 
Animation is, on the whole, very good for the movie. The character have a distinctly European flavour about them, and the animation is very smooth overall, however both can look dated compared to more recent anime. There are some blips, however these are easily overlooked as there is often enough going on to keep your attention. The backgrounds are delightfully rendered, with much of the rural setting possesing a quaint charm which adds to the movie as a whole. There are, again, some minor inconsistencies in how things look, however these do no impact on the movie in any way (so don't worry about them). 
One thing I did like about the movie was how much more representative the changing seasons were to the events in Nello's life, something which is often missed when reading the book. 
Sound is extremely good throughout the movie. The voice actors are very good in the Japanese dub, however this movie is actually better in English, especially as the original story is English so nothing is lost in translation. The English seiyuu have been chosen very well on the whole, however there is a bit of woodenness about some of the characters at certain points (unfortunately the same can be said of the Japanese dub as well).  
The music has a generally pastoral feel to it, and is very much in keeping with the rural setting of the story. There are some scenes where the music not only adds to the impact, but acts like a punch to the stomach, the most memorable tracks being the tragic yet triumphant score during the scene with Patrasche and Nello in the church, and the ED ""When I Cry"" (sung by Dianne Reeves), an original piece that was written specifically for the movie. 
As far as characters go, the movie isn't a patch on the book (so let's get that out the way right now), nor is it a rival for the TV series (which is -- episodes long and part of the World Masterpiece Theater. This movie, like others before it, is very much an abridged version of the story, and as such it loses something in terms of it's characters. However, even with this disadvantage the characters are still as lovable, joyous, hateful, spiteful, proud, envious, sad, etc, as they are in the other versions, and this comes across to the viewer in a very direct manner, with very little melodrama needed (thankfully). Others may not see it that way, however it's important to remember that the story comes from another age altogether, and that life was much harder then, with societal lines far more definite and rigid, and above all, enforced. 
Anyone who's read and ""enjoyed"" A Dog of Flanders knows there's no real way to for me to give the story a nice spin, and truth be told, I shouldn't. This is a very sweet, but also very cruel tale, and whilst it's easy to make light of it because it's a story, the same thing happens every day somewhere in the world - even now. Like I said, the novel is also a social commentary, with money and status being the enemies of one's basic humanity.  
I loved  the book, and I really do like this movie. It's a far better adaptation than some of the live-action efforts I've seen, even though it has it's own flaws. That doesn't mean that anyone who likes the novel will love the movie though, as you may find that your favourite bits have been removed. 
I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good cry. There are those who claim that nothing will move them to tears, yet I have proof that this movie is enough to turn hard-nosed, world weary, --+ year old rugby players (my old team mates), into blubbering heaps, and nobody I've ever shown the movie to has managed to maintain a dry eye come the end. It's up to you if you want to try it, although it is said that a good cry can work wonders. 
Also, if you're a dog lover then you may want to keep those tissues handy. You have been warned. 
This is nothing like Barefoot Gen, GotF, or Ushiro no Shoumen Daare. There are no wars in this tale, no armies bent on world domination, no bombs, no guns. This is more horrific than those movies in a certain sense, as this is an example of what was occuring during peacetime. For that reason alone it stands apart from these and many other anime, especially as the concept of one being outcast is, in this tale, not a cue for god-like superpowers, or for multiple girl/women to fall out of the sky, etc, etc.  
Over the decades the story has been referenced and parodied by so many shows, anime and otherwise, a testament to it's influence in both Eastern and Western media, as well as to it's enduring appeal worldwide. There are many reasons why this story is called a classic, and has been a beloved work of fiction for well over a century (there's even a statue to Nello and Patrasche in the town of Hoboken, Antwerp). 
What really brought it home to me though, was the fact that this is simply a tale about a boy and his dog, and of the loyalty they had to each other.

Have you ever worked under a boss who only found negatives in your performance and ignored literally every positive? He/She abides strictly by the company policy and allows no leeway for you to have fun or express yourself individually, fearing you may upset customers and ruin the reputation of the organization. He/She puts on the persona of being a hardass because they feel as if treating you like an actual human being will make you lazy and content, so to be a drill sergeant is the right thing to do. 
Justy Ueki “Captain” Tylor is the opposite of that. He refuses to carry himself as a haughty authoritative figure and lowers his status to that of his subordinates so that he can communicate with them on a personal level. Each of his employees are allowed to express their full personalities and establish their individuality away from being homogenized dogs of the military. He routinely breaks protocol for the sake of maintaining the morale and safety of his crew, ensuring that they will not be needlessly sacrificed to fulfill the political agendas of a corrupt military operation. Go figure - treating your employees like human beings actually makes them better at their jobs. Send the memo to my supervisor.  
Tylor is truly among the great boss figures in anime. He makes you want to be a member of the Soyokaze where everyone is treated equally and with respect, a scarce reality in the world we live in today. This is where Irresponsible Captain Tylor shines most - immersing the viewer into a fictional work environment that is conducive to personal growth and where everyone is having the time of their lives on a grand adventure within the endless bounds of the galaxy.  
That this adventure is led by an ""Irresponsible Captain"" brings up an important question that the anime throughly explores throughout the narratives - how can a successful captain possibly be irresponsible, and what determines irresponsibility? Tylor is certainly responsible in caring for the safety of his subordinates in contrast to other commanders who willingly sacrifice human life for the sake of honor. But because he dresses sloppily and uses unconventional tactics to overcome obstacles, that makes him irresponsible? The show does a lot to offer a definition of the term through the actions of Tylor relative to other captains who are not nearly as successful as he is, despite being more formal. 
Another dilemma this anime stresses, and certainly the most important, is if Tylor is truly a lucky moron who miraculously pulls victory out of the jaws of defeat, or is he actually a strategic genius who pretends to be an idiot to avoid responsibility? The truth of which is never fully explained to the viewer who is encouraged to interpret in whatever way they wish. My take is that he’s neither a brilliant strategist nor is he simply lucky - he’s phenomenal at enabling people to be their best and cares more for their safety than anything else. By being nice to people, they in turn desire to help him succeed and play a huge factor in the successes of his missions that appear to be miraculously achieved by his lonesome. Kindness drives the success of the greatest space captain, not intellect nor luck, very similar to the charm of Monkey D Luffy who’s greatest strength stems from his ability to make friends. Neither would be successful as captains without relying on the strength of their allies.  
Similar to Luffy, Tylor’s kindness extends beyond his race and includes the alien Raalgon empire who are mortal enemies to the human space federation. The leadership of these groups have historically relied upon stereotypes of the opposing factions without knowing the individuality of each person, and Tylor is the perfect person in command to bridge the gap between them. That his laid back demeanor and sloppy appearance rapidly becomes the face of an entire military organization is a purposeful satire of misaligned military priorities that emphasize strictness over compassion, exact order over variation. 
This anime is usually referenced for being a funny parody of space opera narratives - of which is definitely true, you’re going to laugh a lot  - but there’s also serious commentary on military corruption and wrongfully stereotyping individuals by the faction they belong to that can be found in most other sci-fi/war narratives, most notably Mobile Suit Gundam. Corruption and greed are not exclusive qualities of a race or social group - that there are bad apples everywhere is consistently emphasized within the narrative. 
Irresponsible Captain Tylor deserves to be recognized not only for the comedy, but also the powerful message of a leader treating their underlings like the individuals that they are rather than soulless drones whose only purpose in life is their job description. That this anime can work both as an hilarious parody of space opera tropes AND provide relevant commentary on social concerns that we all face every day is really outstanding. This anime has aged remarkably well and should continue to be relevant forever.

Alright I'll get straight to the point. I love this anime. But I would just like to express my opinion to why I love it and why you should too! alright? alright. A battle of ideals. The most powerful wins. The weak dies and they suffer. Basically this anime is about ideals. Ideals of a person 
and what he or she thinks what is right. A battle of what is right basically. And we have here our two main characters protagonist being Lelouch himself code name Zero and also the antagonist Suzaku Kuraragi . The story revolves around them and their Ideals basically. Now lets talk more about ideals. This anime has shown me that ideals can be a very scary thing and also a weakness. This has shown in the anime that a person's ideals can deny the action of a certain person even if it is what is right. It suppresses them, their own ideals. And just like that our main character is suppressed by his own ideals and so eventually leads to his misery. It's a battle of power and one mistake can ruin everything. And so Code Geass leads to a interesting topic of ideals and if ur an idealistic person then you should definitely watch this show heck doesn't matter just watch this show maybe it'll give you a different perspective of life. Or you know a different set of ideals, Just like what it did to me. This story is a --/-- for me.  
continuation : After rewatching the anime I have realized something. It's surely a battle of ideals. But the only thing that will truly triumph is power. Power is Everything. It doesn't matter what is your ideal. As long as you win, In the end you will triumph. And so that is what I learned in this anime

When i first saw the Covers of this H-Anime i liked the Characters Design and how they look like. The Animation wasn't really bad but the thing this H-Anime lacked of was a ""soul"". It seemed like it had to be done another average rape Hentai which was seen as work and not to entertain people. 
Those Sex scenes were all so common and kind of boring. Besides that i have to say i enjoyed some scenes a bit, like when those tiny monsters raped the princess on a bed or even when the dark elf got taken by some ""filthy orc monsters"" in the basement. But it all didn't seem to be too original. For watching it once it could be acceptable, but thats it, the love is missing.

I figured it was about time I posted a review on one of my favorite anime of all time. Samurai X: Tsuiokuhen (Trust and Betrayal) is a masterpiece of an OVA, and the prequel to the Rurouni Kenshin anime series. 
After having completed the series, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. This OVA series is what gave me a new appreciation for Rurouni Kenshin. Needless to say, you should watch the series before diving into this one, as it will allow you to feel the same as I did. 
The animation is top notch. It is a beauty to behold. The musical score composed by Taku Iwasaki is as Epic as the anime itself though when listening to the soundtrack I felt that it was somewhat repetitive. As for the story, it was absolutely compelling from its action packed start to its ultra sad ending. 
One of the reasons I enjoyed this so much was because of the action and romance that was brought together. The fight scenes are really fast paced and awesome. Whereas the first half, Trust, is more action based, the second half, Betrayal, focuses more on the romance part of the story. I loved the peacefulness of Episode -. Some people, who are only looking for action, may have been disappointed by the lack of it in this episode. This is a drama, that involves action and romance. I feel that between the first two episodes and the last two episodes, a perfect balance was struck. 
This is obviously a must see for anime fans. Fans of the Rurouni Kenshin series get to see Kenshin at his best, not to mention an appearance by Saitou. Even if, for whatever reasons, you do not enjoy Rurouni Kenshin, I must advise you not to pass on this sure to be timeless classic tale of Trust and Betrayal

*spoilers down below for the review of this series* 
Here's going to be my Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works anime review as a whole. Now before anyone goes and attacks me, just because either of my rating score or my review, keep in mind what I will say first. The series is pretty much debatable, people can like it, people can despise it. There's an amount of people that goes and tries to debate on the show, me personally, as a person who likes this series, I won't take the show as a masterpiece, because it's not even a --/--. And if there are people from the Fate/Zero franchise that goes and attacks me as well, keep in mind in here as well what I have to say. I do not like Fate/Zero at the end of the day, but it does not mean that its a bad series. The reason why I prefer UBW in terms of conclusion is because for me it actually had at least a satisfying ending. I know, Fate/Zero ending was incomplete, but that was before I even knew there were other routes. And I still feel like I didn't like Fate/Zero. But the same score went for F/Z and F/SN UBW as a whole series completely.  
Please keep that in mind that this is just one person's opinion, nothing too groundbreaking that could be considered a disease but neither to the point of fangirling towards the point I call a series a masterpiece. 
Story: -/-- 
This is a sequel to Fate/Zero, Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works brings the continuation but rather with a different protagonist, Emiya Shirou, who then became the new master of Saber since it was passed -- years. As the time passed by, we get to see some bits of things going on around the series. The first half of the show was alright but its just because I couldn't see the character development of the main protagonist. We see Shirou following the ideal that he grasped but doesn't take the consideration in the first half that what he would be causing is pain to himself. The second half of the series was more fleshed out in his character, as I look at the both perspective point of view of the same Ideal between Archer and Shirou. Archer its one of the characters that had the same ideal, but as the time passed, he slowly started to regret taking this specific ideal. For Emiya Shirou on the other hand, he takes this ideal as a beautiful thing because he wants to save innocent lives. The story progressed smoothly and gives us some things to understand this conflict. In the end of the day the ending of the show can be interpreted as one of the worst endings, or one of the most satisfying endings. But how can I call this anime series ending? Well in short, from what I can see Shirou will continue to follow the same ideal, but, he will never become like Archer (terms of guardian). So in the end he decided to take a different direction while keeping the ideal he got. 
My only issue with the story is that for me some of the exposition or the info dumping may ticked me off. But then again this isn't the greatest story ever. But it kept what it needed to be. 
Characters: -/-- 
As stated the characters would be a weaker part of the series just because they don't get well developed, but if I think about it in a perspective, then the characters were already developed in Fate/Zero. I don't have any type of issue, but that's just me though. My issue with the show is because they give so little screentime for these characters in this series, that sometimes snaps me out. But regardless there are characters that got developed.  
Emiya Shirou developed as a character, which is the strongest center part. He learns from his ideal and his consequences, and decided to then take another path though he continues to follow the ideal. 
Illya got developed in the show as well, but the issue was the same as stated in the first paragraph. She was given little time to become around that it ticked me off. 
Besides that I still like the characters, even though some didn't fleshed out so much in this whole series, I guess you can say its department is decent in a sense. 
Art/Animation: -/-- 
Here are the good parts of the series which most people would agree with me for the most part. The art and animation was made by Ufotable, the same studio behind shows such as the Kara no Kyoukai movies and Fate/Zero, which this doesn't let me down. They have the ""Unlimited Budget Works"" throughout the whole anime series. I really like how they use the color pallet of the series, and especially with the effects of the weapons, the CGI looks very nice and also when it comes to battles, especially with Gilgamesh, they give impressive angles in the whole anime series. This is the strongest part of the anime. 
Sound/Music: -/-- 
The music department is rather very solid and show fitting, which for me the OST fits very well with the series. From heart warming to tension rising, even fighting OSTs. They use the instrumental approach, which is very nice from them to use. 
Personal Enjoyment: -/-- 
Besides those little flaws, I simply enjoyed a lot on UBW. This is a manner of preferences but I think the enjoyment factor on the series is very much what I didn't thought it had. Entertaining fights, marvelous animation, the amazing soundtrack, and such ends. 
Overall: -.-/-- (Round to an -) 
For me personally, Unlimited Blade Works got the flaws, and I can't deny that. But it was simply one enjoyable experience. As stated this is an opinion regarding on my thoughts. So if you disagree I'm fine with that.

Entertainment is a broad word to be honest. People tend to define entertainment as something of enjoyment and value that is provoked. And what better place to get entertainment than at a circus? As an attraction and adaptation, Black Butler: Book of Circus adapts the Noah's Ark Circus arc from the manga. (Volumes ---, chapters -----) Previously, the arc was skipped from season - (occurs after the Curry Arc). Nonetheless, the show establishes the assumption that you are already familiarized with the franchise; either anime or manga. Taken for granted though, Black Butler: Book of Circus continues the fantasy adventure of a young boy and his butler. They return and takes part of an attraction at a circus where there’s much more than just entertainment. 
The first episode essentially starts off as anime original filler that serves as a way to get fans refreshed and fired up for the main course. The main course here is of course, Noah’s Circus led by a man named Jack. It doesn’t take long for the main course to sink as the majority of the actors and actresses are introduced. But to get the best experience out of this series, it’s important to get attached with Ciel and Sebastian. They play their roles in this arc in a detective-esque role as they investigate the underworld relating to a case of missing children. Point taken, this arc has a combination of both lighthearted and dark moments. The latter is easily realized as the arc progresses with secrets unrivaled and boundaries of civilized behavior shattered in pieces. 
There’s not much change however when it comes to our investigators, Ciel and Sebastian. Their personalities remains generally the same as the previous season. One thing noticeable is their growing attachment such as Sebastian looking after the well-being of his master. At the same time, he also plays the fool and pokes fun at Ciel; in particular his outfit and stage name. On the other hand, Ciel realizes what he must do to secure the case and takes action. Despite seeming like a timid boy, Ciel can be quite courageous and dedicated as evidenced when he gets a flu yet still wishes to continue with the case. Inspiration is perhaps a word to describe this young boy as well when we see how much he despises the darkness that roams behind the circus. And despite being childish at times, Ciel is a clever boy with ideas. Sebastian on the other hand uses his seductiveness to advantage and intellect to aid in the case. His relationship with another grim reaper in this arc adds a touch of comedy with their mutual dislike. The “rivalry” between the two takes various turns and exaggerates itself with oddball humor. Nonetheless, Ciel and Sebastian are still the main duo of this show. They might not be Sherlock Holmes of the century but they got guts. 
Mystery becomes a pivotal point throughout this series’ story as we find out more about the origins of the circus. Ringleader Joker makes his highlight entrance as he performs for the crowd. The show gives the circus performance an extravagant elegance when the characters come to the stage. Characters such as Beast, Jumbo, Dagger, and Wendy all demonstrate their skills with praise. Despite the tongue-in-cheek humor (especially during Beast’s act), the show maintains a good posture with its comedy. It also has a degree of realism as the circus acts are symmetrical to real life circus performances. Joker in particular serves as an entertaining host with his cheerful personality and is able to hide his emotions from others at will. In a way, he is almost similar to Sebastian as both characters are able to hide their true motives while putting on a poker face. At the same time, there’s also adequate relationship dynamics as seen with the case of Beast. Her inner struggles is highlighted through her feelings as we see a more vulnerable side of her. The negative side of this is that we don’t get much characterization of the circus members. We only glance at the motives/ambitions, their personalities, and perhaps where their true purpose lies. There’s minimal amount of flashback or background story to flesh out with these characters as it only scratches on the surface. Unfortunately, a series covered by a mere -- episodes isn’t’ enough to develop them enough which is a shame. The plus side is how we can appreciate the closeness of the Noah’s Circus Trope members. They might be travelers and entertainers but at a closer glance, they almost seem and act like a family as brothers and sisters.  
As the season is more story oriented, expect plot twists and revelations. As mentioned before, the arc gets darker as each episode progresses. Mystery envelops itself with characters such as Doll and Snake. The latter demonstrates a malevolent presence while Doll becomes an epitome for mysteriousness. The imagery the show presents with the story is that there is something dark going on behind the scenes. And seemingly enough, there’s also a mastermind pulling the strings that is even a higher order than the host, Joker himself. The story gets grimmer with sinfully crafted themes that can be stomach indulging at times. It still remains culturally developed with the European like style but gets more complicated. Its gothic style is stylized by the behavior of the characters. Add a touch of fantasy and dream-like atmosphere and we get even more artistic story. Because behind the circus acts lies a dark secret in which this series explores with. Combined with the motivation of the mastermind, the story becomes something of a shadowy theater. Expect the unexpected.  
A-- Studios attempts to bring back the style fans were used to with the previous season. Luckily enough, it achieves its purpose. Action scenes are fluid with well-coordinated movements and pacing. The backgrounds of this series still looks elegant with detailed designs such as the Victorian themes. I’m not just referring elegance with the structures but also the way characters are designed. Indeed, characters are lavishly decorated such as the flamboyant clothes of Joker, the fiery outfit Beasts wears, or the fashionable dress up that Doll puts on. It’s not just wholly imaginative but also makes sense for its circus theme. Similarly, Ciel and Sebastian has style when it comes to their choice of clothing. There’s also minimal fan service except a few cases with the seductive Sebastian. Every demonic butler has to a have a little bit of fun though, right? 
Soundtrack is fluid with orchestral tones and a folklore-like OST. The distinctiveness of the Circus’ theme plays out well with matching background music. And with our characters, voice mannerisms fits quite well with them. The big newcomer, Joker perhaps stands out as a centerpiece of this testament as he plays the sort of ringleader, host, and of pierrot of the show. Make no mistake though. The circus conveys a darker image as the soundtrack gets darker and darker with an unsettling atmosphere on more occasions. Even with the smooth fantasy elements added, the message is there to create an abstract feeling. Oh and OP/ED songs of this series is brilliantly presented. It’s like opening the stage of each episode and finishes it off with an encore. 
There’s a sense of nostalgia with this series. Even though Black Butler didn’t air too long ago, the show feels refreshing. Color me surprised but this adaptation did justice to itself. Despite some fillers inserted in, there’s an impeccable performance with the characters and the story it works with. The spectacle is top notch with clever humor, neatly timed battle scenarios, and well-rounded dialogues. While it doesn’t have too much action compared to the previous seasons, Black Butler: Book of Circus stands out in its own way. It’s an epic feast of a fantasy adventure with the circus and return of Ciel and Sebastian. An accomplished series with goals met. This show is definitely something to keep an eye on if you’re a fan of the original series and manga. Take notice now.

Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods has been hyped up as the big return of a monumental anime franchise, introducing a new villain and bringing back all of your favorite characters for one last giant bout... but does it live up to the hype? The short answer is ""no"". I thought it actually tarnished part of what I loved about Dragon Ball. It stepped over it so harshly that by the end, I had to wonder if perhaps they did it intentionally. 
Let's start off with some of the positives. The art is competent. The quality is essentially on-par with the end of the Dragon Ball Z TV series, except now that art style has transitioned to HD. There are also a few shots which managed to really impress me, in terms of the quality of the animation, however these are few and far between. 
The audio mix seems pretty typical, and sounds like something you would have heard in the TV series. However, there's now also a really horrible rendition of Cha-La-Head Cha-La during the intro, as well as the credits. That's definitely the lowest point of the soundtrack. The rest of the score does it's job and sets the tone, but overall manages to be pretty forgettable. I watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles. There are a few voice actors who seem kind of like they phoned it in, but the actors do a pretty decent job for the most part. Nothing too memorable. 
The story starts off being a pretty typical Dragon Ball Z tale. there's a new villain introduced, and after Goku hears how powerful he is, he feels the need to fight him. No surprises here. There's a short battle sequence, but then something shocking happens. The movie ends up devolving into comedy for an absurdly long time, before going back for a little bit of action towards the end. It felt like about -- minutes of the movie's run-time ended up being comedic, with only a small amount of it being focused around action. There's a few surprising cameos, which I won't spoil, but I will say that as a fan, they were cool to see. Still, a few interesting cameos can't save the movie from being incredibly long-winded and dull. That dullness carries over into the climax as well, which isn't as exciting as it should have been. The whole thing is completely devoid of tension, and it just feels kind of like a dull side-story that didn't need to be told. 
Part of that lack of tension has to do with a major flaw in the new characters. Specifically, the new villain manages to be completely non-threatening throughout, and ruins what little action moments there even are in the film. Some of the returning characters also tend to act a little out of character, compared to the TV series. I've seen most of the Japanese version of the TV series, so I am completely aware about how the characters felt slightly different in Japanese to begin with. However, some of the characters still seem somewhat different in this film. It makes me stop and wonder how little research the writers must have did before writing this script. It's a major embarrassment!  
Overall, I expected Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods to be an action-packed throwback, but what I got was a mockery of the source material, which tends to throw out any interesting plot in favor of an overabundance of comic relief. It's an overall disappointing film, with a few redeeming qualities, and a couple of interesting moments. However, that's still not enough to save it from it's inherently flawed main story, which feels both incredibly lacking, and not very well thought-out. 
I give Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods a -/--.

Nagi no Asu kara has many of the tropes present in adolescent romance anime, but it is a shining example of why these tropes exist in the first place. 
If you were to go down a checklist of tropes, Nagi no Asu kara checks most of the boxes. 
Standard moe, shounen, and straightman characters?  Check. 
Fantasy or supernatural powers and/or setting?  Check. 
Romantic love triangle, or more?  Check. 
And yet, not once did I ever feel that any of the characters of situations felt like common tropes.  The world, characters, and personalities all felt very fleshed out and well developed.    The characters were actual characters, not soulless cardboard, plain and simple. 
The story moves at a fairly quick pace in the beginning, but only if you pay attention to the timestamps.  While watching the show, the pacing was excellent, and I never felt as though the story was progressing too quickly or slowly until the very last episode.  The latter half of the show does slow the pacing down a bit, but it works very well for character progression, which is by far and away to main focus of Nagi no Asu kara. 
The production values are quite solid, with great art and good sound.  The voice acting is fantastic.  I did not watch Nagi no Asu kara with English dub, but I can't imagine any dub comparing to the Japanese voice acting.  As for the music, it was decent and fit the tone of the show very well, but the soundtrack isn't really anything special.  The OPs and EDs are nothing to write home about, though I did quite enjoy the first ED. 
All in all, Nagi no Asu kara is a fantastic watch for anyone looking for an emotional story.  The world that is presented is beautiful, but the characters and the relationships between them are what make Nagi no Asu kara truly shine.

What is there to say about this show?  I had no prior knowledge of it (I seem to have a habit of getting into shows I know nothing about), and decided to watch it because the cover art looked interesting.   
Initially it starts off fair, you get the typical setup you might expect.  It does well at introducing the main character, but initially I was under the impression that there was a large-scale calamity ahead of him, and what I found out is there actually is, it's just under a different pretense than you're lead to believe (This is a spoiler free review, don't worry). 
Welcome to the NHK broaches on NEETs (Not in education, employment, or training), or more importantly, a hikikomori.  Hikikomori is a phenomena (not exclusive to Japan, but more focused to it) where someone completely shuts themselves out from the outside world.  It's not uncommon for them to even stay in the same room for up to a few years.  The main character is somewhat of a Hikikomori, but not completely. 
What follows this setup is an outstanding story of someone overcoming themselves with the help of a few good friends.  Don't misunderstand this show for anything other than a slice of life anime, but even if that's not your cup of tea, it's absolutely worth it.  What I felt this show captivated very well was having us really empathize with the main character.  A lot of people really understand the urge to break away from the outside world and stay in a cocoon to yourself, because that's an area of safety.  So while we're not all Hikikomori, it's something we can relate to regardless.   
As stated before, the show starts off fairly, you get a pretty common setup.  But a while through the show, something a bit unexpected happens that forces our main character to really challenge himself, and does something a little odd as a result.  The common setup kind of breaks out and becomes its own thing, and you're left wondering what's going to happen next.  This happens just when I felt like I had the show figured out, and it was a pretty pleasant surprise. 
There's not a lot to say about it really, it's a slice of life anime, and it's something you have to experience to really appreciate what it broaches on.  I felt a pretty good connection with the characters, and really enjoyed what it brought to the table.  The art was a little strange sometimes, but wasn't by any means disruptive.  The sound quality was good, but I unfortunately didn't make any noticeable impressions on the music.  It's not action packed, it's not even a rollercoaster ride, but what they pulled off with it was absolutely amazing.  I don't know what kept me coming back to it, but I finished it pretty quickly wanting to know what happens next, even if I couldn't even define what was happening at all.  Above all, it closes in a pretty NEET package (hue, pun).

This story has a lot of potentials, but they tried to keep the MC in a neutral route leading to the love interest to be pretty much all over the place and unclear. I believe if they would have stuck to one route it would have been way better. 
That said I understand it was based on a visual novel, and keeping to this route show's a little of everything it has to offer. However, because of this choice, the storyline took quite a hit. 
All in all, I still enjoyed the show. some situation are a bit unclear but you can easily catch on afterward.  
I also noticed that in the last two episodes we had quite the recap which i didn't truly need when binge-watching.

PLOT: Focuses on the journey of the romance between a high school teacher and student. This anime also looks at on how to love in various forms and places xD. 
CHARACTERS: 
Nano: High school teacher, kind, caring, adorable, & shy 
Kuga: Cool, high school student, & caring 
OVERALL: I regret picking this anime because I didn't think that there's going to be those types of encounters (sigh). I assumed the anime would be like (My Wife is a High School Student) because it didn't go as far as this anime. There's not a lot of plot but it's a quick watch, & there's a bit of drama too! Based on this review... (as you guys can tell)... this is NOT my cup of tea.

Barakamon allows you the chance to peer into a story of struggle and self growth, without being bogged down by melodrama.  Each episode is well timed and made good use of comedy, providing a very relaxed ride while you watched the characters continue on their journey.  I very much enjoyed this fact.  Unfortunately this made for a very predictable story as well.  By episode -, I had no doubts about how this anime would end.  I know some people do not mind this, but I enjoy just a little mystery when it comes to the conclusion of a story. 
The art style used in Barakamon, while good, is nothing special.  This is not a totally bad thing though.  The style is a safe one, allowing the viewer to focus more on the characters and the story over anything else.  The emotional effects are done well and each character is unique in both visuals and personality.  So over all, the safe approach turned out to be the best approach.  But it is nothing that will leave a lasting impression on me. 
In this medium the power of the voice is very important.  Each character in Barakamon is voiced by a very talented actor, bring them to life on the screen.  A lot of times when I am watching a subbed anime, I have a hard time trying to figure out which character is talking if they aren't currently being shown on screen.  But I had no problem knowing who was talking and when while watching this.  Which was a very nice change for me.  The sound effects are done well, adding to the over all comedy of the show.  The only aspect keeping this section form getting a perfect -- from me is the music.  It was very lacking in this area.  Other than the opening and ending themes, the music used throughout the show left very little impact on me.  Which is quite the shame seeing how it has the power to add even more to a scene. 
With a genera like Slice of Life, characters are the most important aspect.  When it comes to Barakamon, they are perfectly done.  There is a clear line showing how they were before, and after the main character is introduced.  The experiences they share allows them to grow bonds that the viewer can clearly see.  Not much else to say about it really.  Perfectly done. 
Barakamon was an emotional ride without being crazy emotional, and I enjoyed ever second of it.  In it's -- episodes it manages to do what most anime can't do in --.  Is it something that is ground breaking and never seen before?  No, but that shouldn't keep you from watching it.  Sometimes the tried and tested aspects of anime work the best, and is definitely works for Barakamon.

wasn't able to capture the emotions from the original  
(which was just amazing) 
so in one sentence my review for this would be that  
""it misses the mark set by its predecessor""  
with all it's faults Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back was one of the few movies i was able to enjoy even as a adult because it was a great nostalgia trip the summation of my childhood  
in the case of this movie it's Absolutely soulless no emphasis was placed on improving the narrative they just added few useless extended scenes which only let the movie drag on and on with the -nd half being slow and boring as hell 
the CGI was ok or even in some scenes great with the pokemons and worked really abreast with pokemon moves and other stuff  
but when it came to the human models it's just horrendous! terrible!, sigh  
(i don't have the words forget it) 
let's just say it's a little better then berserk ""a llittle"" 
retrospectively speaking the Beautiful animation/CGI records set by pokemon franchise in the past reached the peak with Pokemon XY&Z and since then it's just going down and with this being released i think we are in the lowest it could be....  
at the end in simple 
I would not recommend this movie just re-watch the original

This was one of the most unique series I've watched, if not THE most. Every aspect of it has uniqueness, be it art or story or characters. There is a lot of humour, which never feels like an annoyance, even in serious scenes.  
Although there were quite a few loose ends or stories that were left without any development (like Magic Eye Free. Honestly I would have liked further details on the Eight Guardians of Death, Eibon etc but that's too much to ask), they did not really annoy me to a great extent. However, the last episode - that is, how it all ends - REALLY REALLY annoys me.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER ALERT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
-. The blow from Asura to Death could easily have been avoided by a man of his calibre. No matter how much you tell me it was a last resort and he didn't have time, come one we're talking about Death here. He could easily have put up at least a weak barrier. The scene happened to move the story on to its final script but this was the first undoing. 
-. Asura initially seems like an exceptional character, filled with madness. However, once he enters his barrier and starts fighting, his character changes.  
-. The words ""I'm relieved"" that Maka utters. Yes, it succeeds in scaring the crap out of Asura, agreed. But it makes absolutely no sense why she would say that at that point of time. If it was a resort aimed at invoking fear, it could only have been seen as such. It wouldn't have succeeded in scaring him. Or, if it was actually her relief, it couldn't have been because literally nothing happens before that for her to be relieved. This was another annoying block in the gears of this anime. They just wanted to defeat Asura using Maka's bravery but they failed in finding a proper script for that. 
-. The final punch that defeats Asura. I get that he was frightened by the bravery, but what actually deals the finishing blow and breaks his mask and face, is the punch. There even was no bravery involved. This was in my opinion the writers relying too much on the bravery concept. They could at least have made Asura's defeat a bit believable. The way they did this was even worse than the cliche ""I need to protect my friends""-shounen-powerup style. Way worse. This just made me scoff at Maka.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~END OF SPOILER~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
As evident, the last episode riled me up bad. The ending could have been so much better. They messed up. 
However, the anime as such still remains really excellent. This was very enjoyable for me. I would really like rewatching this too. But it would be nice if there was a sequel or something that tied up loose ends, developed underdeveloped plots more and just gave us more story.

“This is a disease called serenity...a form of death that people wished for.” 
A world that keeps people under control breeds monsters, in order to keep an equilibrium. Psycho-Pass could have been just another action anime with a cute main girl and attractive bishonen cast, fortunately, that wasn't the case. I would describe this anime as having an unique approach on a detective/ futuristic setting, borrowing a variety of concepts from various media and forming its own world. 
In a world dependent on technology, which seems so guarded and secure, the human psyche has never been more endangered. This world is marked by the existence of the “Sybil System”  (that is unquestioned by the avearge citizen, thus making you doubt the fairness of the system) which was a system created to improve the human society, by sorting out those who have a ""clouded Psycho-Pass"", (which means they have criminal tendecies) from the ""good sheep"". “Mental contamination” is presenting itself as a big issue, coordinating  the future of its inhabitants. The degree of how ""contaminted"" is your psychic health, is being measured by  the ""Psycho-Pass"" device, hence the name of the show.  This is a world where  humans chose comodity over personal freedom, which is only a very well camouflaged illusion.  
The screen play was written by Gen Urobuchi (Nitroplus), the one and only creator of the thought-provoking Madoka Magica, he's the reason for the popular themes that attracts the masses while still delivering intriguing and imaginative themes. The first episode opens with the newly appointed young inspector Akane  Tsunemori that has as her first case the dangerous mission of catching a criminal. As her ""assistants"" she receives in her care a few ""enforcers"" who are described as latent criminals who are allowed into the outside world with the sole purpose of flushing out criminals just like themselves : ""They are hunting dogs. They're beasts used to hunt other beasts."" At first, Akane is intimidated by them, but soon finds out they are victims of the society they live in. They are seen using cool-looking weapons, called “Dominator"" that adapt to the owner's psychological data, which in my opinion is an ingenious concept. 
I should add that action-driven, detective-oriented animes aren't my cup of tea (with the exception of Detective Conan, but that anime has less action and more analytical thinking), but in Psycho-Pass' case it is more than that, I was compelled by the waving of the plot and the philosophical aspects. They are smartly integrated in the plot, such as the existence of a dystopian future, how far can we grasp the mysteries of the human psyche, the thin line between right or wrong, the purpose of justice and law, the human need for comodity, which empties the human potential etc. Another strong point of the series is its social commentaries, using themes such as inequality in the society, fear of confronting reality by immersing yourself in the internet world, the existence of numbness and insensitivity of humans to stimulations since their reason of living had died out, as well as the opposite, people who want to outlive others by resolving to turn into androids. There are concepts borrowed from all over the place, from the science fiction novel "" Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick (which is also mentioned by Makishima Shougo,the literature-loving killer), to George Orwell's famous ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" to William Gibson's cyber-punk universe. 
There is a particular scene that I think is very relevant to understanding the degree of how the existence of the Sibyl System and Psycho-Pass affected the society: A man walks in a crowded street and randomly chooses to attack a woman, cowering in fear of the consequence of having their psycho-pass be clouded, the audience watches apathetically as the woman is being hit numerous times with a hammer/ gavel while being undressed. As if it weren't enough, the spectators even film the scene, seeming to enjoy it tremendously. Approaching her, comes a robot that advises her to go see a doctor, since her psycho-pass is clouded (due to the beating). This scene shows  the irony of the society they live in, on the surface the government pretends that they guard the citizens, but when something like this occurs, no one interferes  A character commented:“They said they couldn't understand what was going on. Someone being killed right in front of you,the idea wouldn't even occur to you. All these people lived up until today without even considering that something like this could happen”. 
There are flaws with the plot which is pretentious and it does have an intellectual approach, however, it does not always succeed in actually being that, having more of a superficial ""intellectual feel"" to it. The anime has good flow until episode --, after that it begins to be unfocused and starts prolonging unnecessarry story lines (however in the final episodes it returns to the original formula).   It is ironic that the best part of the story was the beginning which didn't have so much plot, but managed to maintain its good points, the episodic villains not slowing the plot but preparing it for the climax. 
If you watched series such as Ergo Proxy and Ghost in the shell you may not find the story so innovative. However, if you haven't watched these great shows you'll be able to enjoy the story more than I did. 
Story: - 
I have to say, the first thing I noticed looking on this anime's Mal page, was the design of the characters, I was like :""Are you sure Amano Akira-sensei that did Katekyo Hitman Reborn didn't drew the characters?"" And I was right, you can't believe how happy I was since her drawing style is one of my favorites in manga. The art is very good, the designs for the characters are appealing and eye-pleasing, the scenaries are beautifully drawn and give the feeling the staff put a lot of effort and care into them, as well as in the technological devices. The animation is smooth and it flows naturally, giving a feeling of realism, while still keeping an anime feel to it. 
Art: - 
The sound is great, it has catchy rhythms and lyrics as well as atmospheric backgroud music.I remember a certain lyric  from the ending song ""God....Where did you go?"", which I think suits this society. 
Sound: - 
The characters are likeable, even the main antagonist. At first, I thought Shinya Kougami  was a suicidal maniac, that seeked redemption by being killed. However, that's far from the truth, the audience discovering that he actually wants to live in order to avenge his murdered colleague. I find Shinya's character easy to empathise with (which is always a good thing), he is also interesting as a character, possesing superior observational skills which remind me of Will Graham from Red Dragon, who tries to enter the minds of criminals (at one point we see him reading a book called ""Heart of Darkness"", which presents the exact same situation he finds himself in, a conflict between the ""lower"", un-advanced humans and superior, technology-users ones). 
Akane's physical appearance makes her seem younger than she is, but her personality is far more reserved and mature. She is at one time regarded as “mental beauty” because of the degree of her self-control. One character stated about her that: “She accepts things as they are. She forgives society, acknowledges it, and accepts it. On top of that, she doesn't mind taking risks, so it's not like she's just going with the flow”. However, her relationship with Shinya is almost non-existent even after -- episodes, which really annoys the hell out of me.  
Now, time for the most interesting character in this series, and the reason why this anime is so higly regarded, Makishima Shougo. In a world that humans aren't actually “alive”, as their lives are dictated by the Sybil System, Shougo wants to live life to the fullest. When people are given free hand to commit atrocious murders, they don't hesitate and grasp the chance. This is what Makishima really is in my opinion, a trigger that determines other people to go against the norms of society, fulfilling their destructive desires. He uses his natural leader skills to manipulate other criminals, being like a flame that attracts moths, ending up burning them, him being the only one left standing. His superior talents make him search for his equal, someone he can measure up against without ever getting bored. He represents the ultimate contradiction, his consciousness being crystal-clear and pure while committing heinous acts. He thinks of himself more of an artist than anything, a conductor that orchestrates the destruction of the world he lives in. There is beauty where there is suffering and chaos, only that way humans realise the importance of being alive. The exchange of words  he has with Shinya adds to my enjoyment, as I can clearly see the chemistry between the two characters, each being the reflection of the other, the only thing that separtes them is the side of the coin they are on. 
Nobuchika Ginoza is one of these characters you either love or hate. It is interesting to see his inner conflicts, having to choose between obeying the system or aiding his friends. I find intriguing the fact that he strives to be the perfect inspector, since his own father failed as an inspector and became a latent criminal, disgracing his family. His fear of not wanting to became a latent criminal like his father is smartly crafted, though I would have enjoyed to see more of their relationship. There is also the tensionate realationship with Shinya, his former collegue and friend, who betrayed him like his father did, becoming a latent criminal, and for that, Ginoza never forgives him. 
However there are flaws with the characters as well. Even if Akane is the main character I would have liked to see more of her, the amount of information we receive about her is unsatisfactory. That doesn't only happen with her, but with Shinya as well, since we don't know anything about his background other than that he was an inspector.  
Characters: - 
This anime is worth watching, it does deserve some of the praise it gets, even if it had its flaws. It is however one of the most well-made anime in the winter-spring season of ----. I will end quoting Makishima, 'cause I liked it a lot: "" Just like God? That might be pleasurable in its own way, but unfortunately I'm not into umpire or referee, as I can't genuinely enjoy the game if I were one”.

This anime is a Yaoi shota love story. If you're uncomfy with that, please go away :p 
This OVA is simply a remontage of the original ""Boku no Pico"". Except that there's a new opening (of almost -mins !! Never seen a so much long OP before !) and that every explicit porn moments have been removed. 
Basically, it's the story about a young shota boy named Pico who meets a guy named Mokkun. They become friends and sex buddies and that's all. Yeah the story really sucks (and I'm a fan of Pico anyway)... 
So, if you watch this anime, it's for Pico, because Pico is very cute... Well you must love traps for that first, of course :p 
The sex scenes have been modified so the scenes are only suggested. They also included comments from Mokkun and Pico during the action, giving a little ""omake"" to the OVA... Beside that, it's exactly the same story as ""Boku no Pico"" first OVA. 
This OVA is a good deal if you always wanted to know what the f*** is that anime in the ""YOOOOOOOOO"" video and don't want to watch the hard porn 
which is inside.  
Otherwise, I'd suggest you betteer to watch the real Boku, since the porn scenes are the main thing. :p

NOTE: This is literally my review from MS IGLOO: The Hidden One Year War, but Apocalypse ---- is so bad in the same ways i'm not even going to waste my time writing a new one when the old one fits perfectly. 
TL;DR: I can only imagine die hard Gundam fans watching this and enjoying it ironically. 
Oh man. This was a complete mess. From every standpoint. The CGI doesn't hold up at all. Everything looks like a bad PS- cutscene. The facial expressions where so exaggerated at times I bursted out laughing. 
The story is non existent. Because this is supposed to show us the OYW thru Zeon's eyes I thought we would get to know the principalty and it's people better. Nah. Just a couple of battles only from Zeon's POV. The episodes are so boring when it's not being funny by accident because of how incompetent it is. 
The only good thing about this is the Mobile Suits in action, they're the only part where the animation is actually pretty cool and ejoyable. Sadly this only happens in the last couple of minutes of every episode. In a brighter side, it's only - episodes long, so it won't be too insuferable like the -- episodes from ZZ.

Tl;dr: Any possible potential this show had is ruined by the lack of scary scenes, cliched characters, utter dearth of character development and inconclusive ending. If you’re even remotely the critical thinker type, this will not be an enjoyable experience. - out of -- stars. 
This show was something that a friend used to really be into circa ----. I recently remembered it out of nowhere and decided to check it out -- figured a MAL rating of close to - couldn’t be that bad, could it. Boy, was I wrong, and HOW. 
Let’s start off with the horror aspect. There is none. Out of -- episodes I was scared for a grand total of two minutes in one episode. Even setting aside the facts that the spooks were intended for a younger audience, the stories themselves weren’t creepy or scary or even absorbing. The only reason things could be considered spooky is cheap jump scares, with the exception of the two minutes I mentioned. The music builds up to scary moments, but is let down by the mediocre visuals. The arcs (cases) last for --- episodes, which is something I don’t mind since it prevents binging. 
This is a typical shoujo anime, which means a romance between the lead pair is inevitable. My issue here is that there is no real indicator that the guy even likes the girl or favours her. She has slight ESP and her subconscious chooses to send messages to her in the form of the guy - but that’s in her head. So to be clear, she falls for the guy (pretty quickly, I might add) for no discernible reason, doesn’t bother to differentiate her idea of the guy from the person himself (again, they have little interaction except when she’s ordered around by him) and thinks that because she is attracted to him, it gives her some kind of claim on him. FYI, it doesn’t. Mutual consent is important, girls. 
The guy is very pretty and very smart, but I don’t know enough of him beyond that to say anything. He’s seventeen, runs a psychic detective agency, does his own thing, whatever. He’s so unimpressive that I don’t miss his presence at all. It has been hinted at that he is the Quiet Boy with Unfathomable Emotional Depths, but that is never elaborated upon. 
As for the protagonist herself, I have to say this - she’s just plain dumb. When you’ve been handling paranormal cases for a while now, hearing a child say they’re sad someone is alive is a pretty good indicator that they’re possessed. She’s supposed to be the “heart” of the team (because girls are emotional, of course!) but that’s not the issue - it’s that she feels bad for everything and everyone and refuses to be practical. She leaves people alone when told not to leave them alone. She does things she’s told not to because of her feelings. At the same time, the guy (who’s her boss in a way) refuses to divulge plans with her for no reason and then expects her to not question him, which puts them at odds. So not only is every outburst of hers irritating to watch, it’s also invalidated by the guy in the end, and she ends up apologizing even though it’s partly his fault. I hate their dynamic; can you tell? 
Leaving aside the protagonists, the side characters are likeable enough but it’s pathetic how they don’t develop through two cours. There’s an older (--s) lady who seems somewhat flirtatious (we know she’s a vamp because she wears lipstick) and there’s a younger girl the protagonists’ age who also helps with their cases. I’m happy to add that the protag and this girl don’t hesitate to help each other even though they’re rivals for the main guy’s lurrve, so that’s nice. The character I most like is the monk (who moonlights as a rock star? But leave that aside) since he acts like a responsible adult and looks out for the protagonist. But none of the characters are elaborated on beyond mentioning things in passing and never returning to them. It’s frustrating and disappointing, because the side cast have decent interactions and are fairly likeable. 
The worst part of the series, though, is its callous handling of death. The crew don’t seem terribly upset even when the paranormal incidences lead to deaths of their clients; they don’t seem fearful or nervous at the risk to their lives. Along the with open ending of the series (which leads to stuff in the last arc being unexplained), it makes for a very disappointing watch. My chief emotion when it finished was regret at wasting ten hours of my life on this show. That should tell you enough.

This is definitely a film you need to watch more than once. I think it’s pretty close to what you would get if David Aronofsky, David Lynch and a very young Walt Disney decided to make a movie together. I like adult anime and “Perfect Blue” fits the definition. This is not for children. A Pop Idol, Mima Kirigoe, decides to become an actress and in the process appears to descend into madness. Sounds pretty simple, right? Well, It isn’t. So much information is packed into Mima’s journey that, even when you’re paying attention, you might find it confusing at times. I found watching it the second time was even more enjoyable that the first time but don’t let that put you off. This script pays homage to several master directors and is extremely well done. Even the English language dubbing is tight enough to not be distracting. There are threats on Mima’s life, she’s stalked and has a fake website put up in her name. Add letter bombs, stabbings, disassociative personality disorder all tied to a non-linear story line and you end up with an haunting psychological thriller with a more suspenseful ending than a lot of well known mainstream motion pictures. The tagline sums it up beautifully: The Color of Illusion is Perfect Blue.

Two balls, one strike. 
If we assume the anime studio is the pitcher, in this metaphorical game of baseball, then out of the three pitches (i.e. anthology films), only one was a success — a strike, if you will.  One was mediocre at best, and the other was, well, let’s call that one a wild pitch.  Considering that this comes from the creator of Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo), which, in my humble opinion, was a train-wreck of a movie — let the hate commence — and is only revered by people who prefer to look through the lens of nostalgia.  It comes as no surprise that this weird amalgamation of three diverse ideas is, as a whole, fairly unremarkable.  There are glimmers of brilliance throughout the three works, but not enough for this to be considered a landmark in anime achievement.  Perhaps I was wrong to expect profundity, when mild intrigue would have been more than sufficient.  But enough bemoaning over my own misjudgment, let’s take a look at each story as it was intended to be received: individually. 
Magnetic Rose: -/-- 
The screenplay comes from none other than the brilliant Satoshi Kon (Director of Perfect Blue and Sennen Joyuu), yet, chronologically speaking, this work predates his later “master works,” and it is evident in his lack of detail.  An abbreviated version of the story goes as follows: a renowned opera singer loses her voice, and, as a result, her desired husband, Carlo.  Not willing to accept her unfortunate circumstances, Eva — the renowned opera singer — murders her husband, and creates a simulated environment to lure in unsuspecting men to play her “new” Carlo.  This poignant, melancholic script has Kon’s hands all over it, but, unlike his future works to come, it lacks a certain level of refinement and character development that was sorely needed.  To illustrate this point, look no further than Miguel, who is so focused on being with Eva, that he completely disregards the obvious illusions that Heintz points out to him.  In fact, this happens several times, until he finally relinquishes himself to Eva.  It is obvious that Miguel was intended to serve as a plot device, rather than participate in a meaningful way in the story.   
Heintz, on the other hand, is more level-headed than his libidinous friend.  Be that as it may, his function in the story is relatively basic all the same, as he reveals the main philosophical idea the anime was attempting to achieve, without allowing the viewer to figure it out for themselves.  Spoon-fed answers never go down quite so well, as they insult the viewer’s intelligence, making the experience exceptionally lackluster.  Fortunately, Satoshi Kon learns from this mistake, as the ambiguous Perfect Blue permits the viewer to contemplate several alternatives without ever knowing the actual truth. 
On a positive note, I did enjoy the atmospheric juxtaposition between the Victorian architecture (representing Eva’s past), and the modernized space equipment.  The artwork in this episode was especially on point, creating a frightening environment that felt palpable for the entirety of the episode. 
Stink Bomb: -/-- 
Easily the worst contribution of the three films.  Nabuo exemplifies the “captain oblivious” trope, proving once again, that a terribly written character can dismantle an otherwise interesting idea.  Do anime writers seriously think that this sort of naive ignorance portrays a realistic, grounded character with several levels of emotional depth?  Because it doesn’t.  It simply reminds the audience that capturing authentic human tendencies is difficult work, and rather than strive for originality, its much easier to use “tried and true” formulas.  Also, I understand that Nabuo’s gas emission was scrambling the electronics on the various missiles sent towards him, but come on!  Are we really suppose to believe that tanks, jets, and battleships were all incapable of hitting one man riding a scooter?   
“But Krunchyman, it was meant to be a dark comedy.  Stop taking it so seriously.” 
I don’t remember laughing with or at this film.  I felt like I wasted -- minutes of my life, watching a film without an overarching message, and no semblance of constitutes comedy.  If you want dark comedy, then watch the Frank Grimes episode of the Simpsons (“Homer’s Enemy”).  Frank represents the struggles of the common man, in which he works hard, but receives none of the adulation that he feels he deserves.  This is applicable to almost any person, as we all have felt this way at some point in our lives.  Nabuo, on the other hand, has no universal human qualities, except for the fact that he has a cold — big whoop. 
Cannon Fodder: -.-/-- 
Remember how I criticized Magnetic Rose for spoiling the underlying theme it was attempting to convey?  Well, no need to worry here, because Cannon Fodder understands the power of ambiguity, deciding to say very little through the use of dialogue, but, instead, allowing its artwork and character designs to do the talking. 
I believe the strength of this particular episode comes from its implied commentary on our own social values.  We tend to believe that our thoughts/attitudes are the result of our own choices; nevertheless, Cannon Fodder demonstrates that governments, educational systems, and our parents (indirectly, by avoiding their “failed” life choices) shape our reality, and by default, who we ultimately become.  This doesn’t only occur in the dystopian society pictured, it happens in freely elected Democratic societies, as well.  As a point a reference, compare Howard Zinn’s, A People’s History of the United States, with any generic high-school history book — I guarantee the difference will be substantial.  Yet, the selectively distorted history from your high-school textbook is what a large majority of the population tends to believe as the truth (shaping their reality like the little boy in Cannon Fodder).  This is why Cannon Fodder, despite its murky atmosphere, shines through as the best offering in the Memories series.  It showcases relatable attributes to each one of us, whether we acquiesce to the norms of society and go with the flow, or whether we strive to modify the current paradigm, despite the hardships of swimming upstream — just like the protestor’s at the factory. 
Overall: -.-/-- 
It’s a bit confounding to me why these three particular films were lumped together in a single offering, especially because each film represents a different philosophical message.  Perhaps Otomo could not visualize expanding each idea into a feature length film, and thus, decided to roll them all out to clear his desk for future projects.  Whatever the case may be, it was an intriguing trio of films that, besides the Stink Bomb episode, was worth the investment in time, yielding memorable moments, and exhibited what the medium can/should be capable of in the future.

shit. i don't even know why i'm writing this but i'm going through benzo withdrawals and other stuff and as long as i write something i feel like my anxiety eases up a little bit. 
the first time i watched this anime was about --- years ago, when i was ----- years old. at the time i thought ""huehue awesome, underdog, can relate, omg cool fighting scenes"" when watching it and would have most likely given it a -/--. 
just about a month ago i rewatched this anime and part of me regrets it but at the same time it's kind of fun to laugh at how retarded you used to be and crush your angsty teen dreams. 
the first thing that hit me about the series as a whole is that any sane, rational adult should be able to see that kenichi is the bad guy. 
let me break it down to you: (spoiler warnings) 
-. kenichi has a childhood friend 
-. they play and get toy badges from a vending machine 
-. kenichi trades his friends badge for a girls badge (the main heroine) 
-. his friend now wants that badge that he traded, and rightfully so since he was literally the one who bought it. 
-. kenichi insists on keeping the badge and goes as far as to beat his friend up, and then even pouring salt on his friends wounded pride by letting him have it. in other words the situation is basically the same as if i would randomly go out in the street, snatch the phone of any random stranger, then beat him up just to give it back to him later. 
-. odin (the childhood friend) was obviously traumatized by this experience, so he sets out to get his revenge, and rightfully so. he even states that he wants kenichi to realize that his naive sense of justice will hurt people, and wants to stop him to save others from having to experience the same trauma that he himself went through, in other words he does not only act for revenge but also partly for altruistic reasons. 
and then kenichi's outsidership is as overblown as in naruto, we never actually get to see any flashbacks from his upbringing where he was bullied, and we don't really even see him get bullied at all. all we get to know is that people basically called him ""weak"" and that he didn't have any friends. 
kenichi is in other words extremely delusional and subconsciously uses his naive sense of justice to justify beating people up to ""blow off steam"" from his oh so tragic childhood that we know nothing about.  
the ending scene is also extremely rushed and just generally feels braindead. 
kenichi: ""omg i'm so sad that my childhood friend is gone again"" 
his grandmaster: ""eh fuck that guy, look over there, you have friends already so why care about him"" 
kenichi: ""makes sense, now i'm genki genki again"" 
that is all i really have to say about this show, to sum it up, if you want some cool action scenes and training montages and you are below the age of --, then by all means give it a try. 
this is all written very hastily but idgaf right now. sue me.

If you're familiar with other series that involve time travel, this won't be too different. However, there are a few things here and there that make it interesting.  
Another thing I personally like is how everyone is so connected and the ""wtf"" moments that it gave birth to.  
Sure, there was a textbook tsundere character here, but that wasn't enough for me to hate anything about the series or even the character herself.  
Overall, this series made my emotions get all crumpled up and thrown around, but were ironed out later. It was quite the adventure. I do suggest you give it a try, though I had to force myself past the first two or three episodes to really enjoy it. Don't give up!

This show is interesting in that it fails in a thought-provoking way (two ways, actually). Fail number one is being in the wrong medium. Hensuki is a confused visual novel which does a good job of highlighting that different mediums require different storytelling devices to work. The first four episodes are essentially a long-ass bait-and-switch sequence of School Days/Doki Doki Literature Club variety (although not even remotely that dramatic). They unfold like a gal-ge script written by a neural network - a bland highschooler MC given a harem of bland archetypes just because, going through a bucket list of bland romcom situations. There is even a male friend advisor - a straight-up date-sim gameplay mechanic. But all this schmaltz is just a way to set up what the MC expects out of his school life - and what he doesn’t get, because each and every girl is actually one of the female pervert archetypes - it was an ecchi comedy all along. And this doesn’t work in an episode-once-a-week show because the audience still has to trudge through a month worth of boredom, supposedly to get to “the good stuff,” but there really is no reason to do that. 
Fail number two is not knowing what kind of story you are trying to be. Basically, our generic self-insert is assaulted by multiple Darknesses - but not in a fun way. It is played completely straight, because he’s neither blissfully oblivious, nor chad enough to just roll with it, like you would expect from the two main species of harem protagonists - he’s genuinely dumbfounded and creeped out. And his situation just keeps getting worse. If the show took itself a little bit more seriously, it would’ve been a great psychological horror about a male teenager being harassed by female perverts. However, it insists on being a comedy - which in turn, is not funny because of the way too serious atmosphere. The comedy here follows your basic setup-punchline structure, but it’s a twenty minutes setup for a single punchline per episode. 
-/--. If you like the premise, watch OniSuki for literally the same exact show except done right.

Art film 
Warning: there is a moment of blood and gunfire/death. While it is somewhat cartoonist I am not sure all ages in a right fit. 
Story 
-Introduction took its sweet time loading in. A bit too long for me (roughly half a minute) 
-no plot, mainly random bizarre events. 
-introduction wasn’t something worthwhile. In fact it was sad. No, it didn’t draw an emotional buildup but I feel sorry that the artist wanted to go in such bleak fashion. To me it stated the artist was forced to make this for whatever reason and was glad it was done. 
Art 
-art was at least in the lines. Good for those that are somewhat perfectionists. 
-art isn’t always new. Fair amount of moments of recycled art. 
-lacks in character emotion. 
-at least production has color. While color isn’t what one may expect for elements used understand this is not a regular anime but one made long ago during testing phases (a grandfather anime for color) 
Sound 
-effects didn’t always make sense

***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** 
Lying in the ocean is an island paradise; its inhabitants peacefully going about their lives. A cool breeze sweeps through, lightly caressing the body of one of the residents. Ominous music calmly drifts into the viewer's ear as the camera brushes across the tranquil scene hinting that something is ""off."" A voice heard by all suddenly rings out, clear as the azure sky on a bright summer day— 
""Are you there?""  
The voice entraps those who hear it; an ethereal feeling washes over the body; the residents are frozen in place.  
The voice is gentle... 
Inquisitive... 
Tempting... 
It seizes the very soul of the one who hears it. 
""Did they find us?"" a man's voice cuts through the air. 
Emergency alarms blare piercingly.  
A strange word dances across the screens of the electronic devices on the island: 
Alvis. 
The residents evacuate to the island shelters, a strange feeling gripping them—its younger inhabitants having strange thoughts rush into their minds, thoughts they shouldn't have. They instinctively understand what is happening; they have been conditioned as such. Should an emergency arise, certain elements about what they need to understand the situation have already been implanted within their brain. 
A creature has breached the island's shields, its form enriched with a golden luster—the Festum. Its beauty entrances those who see it.  
Alvis, the island's last line of defense, and its members rise to meet the looming threat to their peace, a fierce battle quickly ensuing. 
""Is it reading our minds?"" a panicked voice shakes in the cockpit of a plane. 
""Are you there?"" the question rings repeatedly through the heads of the pilots facing the mysterious creature. 
Their minds have been breached—they must resist, or risk assimilation.  
As the creature swiftly finishes them off, havoc rapidly spreads throughout the island. 
A young boy's assistance is requested. 
Led to the Fafner unit—a machine named after the giant who became a dragon from Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen—he is asked to pilot it in order to fight the Festum. How is he to fight in this machine if he's never seen it before? 
A red gel-like substance with rings inside it. His fingers reach out: 
""I know this."" 
He has begun to understand, the locks on his mind have been lifted, the ideas blocked away are starting to come to him. 
The unit starts up, and the Siegfried System crosses with the visual and auditory sensors of his brain, projecting a reddened image of someone—a boy who was once his friend. He must unite with the Fafner to face that which threatens the safety of his home; he must become the Fafner.  
And the journey begins. 
Note: I wrote the introduction in this summary-like way because it will make it easier to discuss certain elements from it later in the review.    
Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor/Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor, or simply, Fafner, is a series that starts off with a bang, quickly thrusting the characters and the viewer right into the midst of a conflict. Numerous questions are immediately raised, mysteries that leave the viewer hungry for answers. Fafner's first episode is fast-paced and rapidly drops a large number of concepts onto the viewer's plate which could easily be described as far too much, far too quickly. This rapid influx of material to take in could possibly elicit some confusion within the viewer as well. A lot of information is given in just a single episode, and, while this can be a bit overwhelming, it can easily be seen that Fafner is a series that holds a large amount of potential. Will it capitalize on that potential though?  
Fafner is a series that initially seems to struggle to find itself, but, soon enough, it demonstrates that it does, in fact, have its own identity. Fafner has several ideas it wants to explore, a number of interesting places it wants to visit, significant messages it wants to communicate, and a large cast of unique characters to develop.  
To begin, the writing in the first ten or so episodes of Fafner is not anything special for the most part, and it leads to a number of the ingredients of the series feeling under-cooked or unexplored. While I say this, the first episodes certainly did keep me entertained, and, by the end of the series, I came to have a new appreciation for them and what they managed to achieve, even if the execution left much to be desired. At around the mid-way point of the series the writing sees a significant improvement as it is at this point that the one who handles the script for the series was changed (I think it was around Episode -- that it shows the change in the credits). Another individual takes the helm, Tow Ubukata, a man who will probably forever be recognized for his failures (Psycho-Pass -, Ghost in the Shell: Arise) while his successes fall into obscurity. With Fafner, Ubukata managed to take what had been established in the early episodes and unite everything the series wanted to achieve in a cohesive way; he succeeded in galvanizing the messages the series wanted to portray with a polished finesse. Since writing on this first installment into the Fafner franchise, Ubukata has written all related content for the series. Down the road, Fafner would go on to get multiple sequels, a prequel OVA, and a movie.  
Fafner is a series that has a rather melancholic, yet simultaneously optimistic tone, strange as that may seem. It certainly features a rather tragic story, but there is an ever-present tint of hope lingering in the air—a faith in humanity. Within Fafner, humanity is basically fighting a losing war against a silicon-based lifeform from space, the Festum. Having been pushed to the brink of extinction, much of Earth is left a ravished wasteland. In this ruined and broken world people are simply trying to survive by any means necessary. One such group is found on the island haven of Tatsumiya. There are also other groups such as the Neo U.N., as well as those that can be found in Exodus (I won't be talking about Exodus here though. That's a review for another day) grappling for survival, each seeming to hold slightly different ideals. 
If there's one thing that Xebec is notoriously well-known for it's their visuals, and not in a good way. In a number of their series of today they are frequently absolutely horrendous, but that is not the case with Fafner...okay maybe it is most of the time, at least with this installment into the series that is. Oddly, it still looks better than some of the stuff they've made recently though. How that happened, I don't know. Anyway, I do believe the animation is impressive in some scenes, but there are also a lot of scenes where it could have been better. I can't say the animation is anywhere close to being perfect because it will take a hit and there are times where it can be rather awkward. However, while the animation (or lack thereof in some instances) is not the best in this first installment into the Fafner franchise, I think the art/artstyle of the series manages to significantly make up for it. 
The color choices within the series are rather muted and possess a gloomy hue that adds significantly to the tone of the series. The ocean that surrounds the island on all sides is a dark blue, frequently giving off a rather lonely feeling, which is often oppositely weighed against the feeling of unity that can be found among our cast of main characters. The darkened ocean also gives a feeling that perhaps it could represent the internal feelings of some of our characters within the series at times. Existentialism is a big part of this series and the dark, lonely, melancholic ocean can often come across as something meant to be compared with the struggle for finding meaning in one's life or finding who you are. A character may feel lost in that black ocean as they struggle to find where it is they belong in the world, which I believe was a comparison mentioned at least one time in the series. Backgrounds within the series are quite stunning (not always though), probably more so than the actual things in the foreground a lot of the time. The greenery on the island boldly asserts its presence and the grey and brown colors that adorn the homes of the residents add quite a realistic feel to them as they dot the land across Tatsumiya.  
Character designs within the series are likely going to be very hit or miss. They were handled by Hisashi Hirai, an individual whose designs are certainly unique. Probably most well-known as the character designer for Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, he handled them here for Fafner as well. While they seem to be rather disliked by some, I actually liked the character designs in this series, but hey, that's just a personal opinion. Well, they are adding a little something I guess. I think the designs do a good job of placing an emphasis on the character. For a story where characters play a massive role, these designs make them seem more ""visible."" They stand out so much that it makes it somewhat hard for a character's presence to be ignored.  
The Fafner units have sleek and polished designs. When speaking of the service these machines provide to the series they are rather praiseworthy. When a pilot is chosen for one of these machines they essentially must become the Fafner unit. They are not a pilot of the unit, they are the unit (this has to do with Being and Nothingness, something I will elaborate a bit more on throughout this review). I guess it could be said that it ""merges"" with them. As described in the series, they see as the Fafner sees, they feel as the Fafner feels. This naturally means that they will feel the damage sustained by the machine as well, but to keep them fighting efficiently it will be reduced by transferring it to the operator of the Siegfried System.  
The Siegfried System is essentially where the one who commands the Fafner units directs them from during an operation. The operator of this system crosses with the minds of all the Fafner pilots to get the layout of a situation so as to be able to command an operation accordingly. Since the operator of the Siegfried System will also feel the damage a Fafner unit takes, they are in a rather difficult position. The operator of this system must possess good judgement as well as be able to function under extreme conditions to maximize the survival rate of the mission. Despite not being directly on the front lines their job is quite important to the outcome of a battle as they are in a sense responsible for the lives of all the Fafner pilots.  
The fact that the ones who link with the Fafner units must essentially become those machines is the reason why it is far more difficult for adults to be pilots. The series implies (and outright states in the novel) that seeing yourself as something else, using your imagination to visualize yourself as something else, is much, much easier when you are younger. This explains why it becomes much more troublesome to pilot a Fafner unit the older a person is and would be the reason as to why the Fafner pilots are young.  
The Fafner units themselves are machines designed to combat the Festum's abilities. In order to make their pilots function as efficiently as possible they directly link with them and bring to the forefront their survival instincts by stimulating the Reptilian Complex. Rage, fear, anger, hatred, etc. can come forward and can change their pilots mental state so they can fight the Festum effectively. It can also change the person themselves after they leave their unit. As a result of this, the machines are quite dangerous to the well-being of their pilots which can be seen on numerous instances. When inside the Fafner a character's established personality can completely change, shifting to one that is far more animalistic in nature. The after-effects can probably most clearly be seen in Koyo's change after Shoko's death. Having had feelings for her, the Fafner unit stimulates his anger and hatred at her death, frequently manifesting in him lashing out at Kazuki verbally, as his rational thought has been affected by the Fafner unit. Koyo's behavior would probably aggravate viewers who don't understand why he is behaving the way he is. They may just think he's being a jerk. He's not though. He's been altered and he is no longer who he once was. This can clearly be seen if we look at who he was before becoming a Fafner pilot. Koyo was a rather kind-hearted and loving characters in the series, a boy who would die for his friends if necessary. A boy who has been changed unwillingly.  
The Festum are meant to be seen as a beautiful creature and the golden tone they possess coupled with their majestic appearances are alluring. They are a strange, complex lifeform, but an important thing to realize about their nature is that they are not attacking humanity because they want to wipe them out—at least not initially, that is. They are simply confused and do not understand humans. The Festum are a hive-mind species that constantly assimilate information and refer to themselves as ""we."" Being a hive-mind they don't comprehend a humans way of life. They wonder ""why"" humans are doing such strange things. They genuinely believed they were helping humanity when they began assimilating them. And this is where changes gradually began to manifest within the Festum. Emotions are a foreign concept to them, and when humans are assimilated frequently negative emotions are what is running through them as it happens: hatred, anger, etc. They don't understand this, they don't comprehend what it is they are experiencing.  
As expected, when the Festum take negativity into themselves they will eventually learn such emotions themselves. This gives rise to a Master Class Festum referred to as Idun, a Festum who has learned hatred from humanity. He is consumed by it and it eventually leads to several encounters with him in the series.  
The Festum do not have individual will; they are created by something called the Mir, their ""God,"" which they cannot go against, as the will of the Mir is their own will. The Festum are another way for the series to explore Being and Nothingness. 
The Festum are also used as a way for the series to make a point. Festum are something that a vast majority of the world believe needs to be eradicated. A few people however, such as some of those on Tatsumiyajima, believe coexistence with each other is possible, and efforts will be made to try and see this happen. This is a primary topic of the series, the idea that two separate, intelligent lifeforms can understand one another. It's also done to try to make yet another statement: if coexistence between humans and Festum is a potential possibility, then shouldn't it also be possible between all humans as well? Considering humanity is often fighting each other rather than the Festum a lot of the time it seems to be a rather poignant examination. 
The battles within the series are what I'd describe as being engaging to watch, seeing as they will always manage to find a new way to innovate old ideas, successfully managing to keep each one unique and special in its own way. The whirlwinds of action meshed with psychological and philosophical exploration create a special tension that, personally, kept me quite interested in what was happening. A perfect cocktail of thematic depth mixed with emotional reverberation is something that is not easy to achieve, but it was pulled off to great effect.  
The music in the series is mesmerizing when it plays, being expressively forlorn and beautifully heart-rending when necessary. It certainly left an impression on me and managed to become one of my favorites. The voice acting is quite astounding in certain scenes with the emotional depth being conveyed exceptionally well. Kazuki's pain as his best friend Soshi disappears as he screams, ""Soshi"" repeatedly is heartrending. The touching poignancy of Episode -- when Kazuki confronts his past and realizes that what he wants is to protect the island, his home, is deeply moving to see play out, especially for a character who has struggled to find his place in the world. The opening theme, ""Shangri-La,"" and the ending theme, ""Separation,"" were both done by angela. The opening theme drips into the viewer's ears with a blend of ominous instrumentation mixed with a heavy-hearted delivery of sorrowful lyrics, while simplistic, yet relevant visuals progress across the screen. The visuals of the ending are even simpler, just zooming across three characters with solemn facial expressions, as the melancholic and mournful music plays out.  
It's no surprise that a series based on something like Norse mythology can get quite dark and rather tragic, taking a vast amount of inspiration from it and a few other things related to it. This is probably most obvious through the name Fafner, but also other names like Fenrir and Mjolnir. These are only the most blatant of instances though, and to go further into detail of the other little things would result in this review being even longer than it's already going to be*, so I'll just briefly mention one thing. Fenrir, in this series, is a self-destruction weapon on the Fafner units, there to allow the pilots to detonate the machine so as to avoid assimilation. This is a preventive measure so it doesn't force allies into having to kill someone who was once their friend after assimilation. This Fenrir function may be hinting at a Fafner unit eventually using it's Fenrir function to detonate with the Mir, the ""God"" of the Festum, seeing as Fenrir is foretold to kill Odin during Ragnarok, if coexistence can never be found. This is only speculation, however, it was stated that if Kazuki's Mark Sein were to use Fenrir the destruction would extensive. Looking more into these related things that the series takes inspiration from could help you to get more out it in the long run. 
The Neo U.N. often take on an antagonistic role to the island of Tatsumiyajima. They are another faction of humans who are trying to survive in this broken world. To call them purely ""evil"" is to have missed the point though. Their methods can be very extreme, but I can understand why they are the way they are in this world. It makes sense, though they may not be agreeable methods, I can see where they are coming from.  
Additionally, just because the people at the head of this group may be that way is no reason to assume that all the members of the group are that way. Everyone is simply trying to survive, by whatever means necessary, in Fafner.   
It would be a mistake to call Tatsumiyajima entirely free of sin as well. After all, they are making their younger generation fight. Even if the adults can't pilot the Fafner units, that's still no justification. These battles are all the more dangerous because of how the Fafner can alter the mind. The island also hides itself from the rest of the world. They have the means to fight back more efficiently against the Festum, but prioritize their survival above all else. Again, this is an understandable action. After all, they are a small island, and their help can only aid the world so much before they find themselves in a situation they cannot defend themselves against.  
Also, the island ""conditions"" its residents when they are young. When their brains are not fully developed (another reason why young people pilot Fafners) they have certain information planted into their minds so they can be able to understand things in an emergency situation. The information is locked away until a situation demands it necessary to flow out. This can be seen in the first episode. It's not made all that clear, but most obviously we can see this in Kazuki with how he instinctively understands how the Fafner works. (This also has to do with existentialism and the absurd in a way.) His exclamation of, ""I know this."" serves to show that the information locked away is gradually being released.  
Additionally, the young characters were not born via natural means. There are discussions of gene manipulation which is yet another topic in which many questions are raised. Fafner often spends its time engaging in dialogue-heavy philosophical topics or discussing its own in-universe science which can can quite extensive. Thankfully, it's actually interesting stuff that has relevance to the plot and makes sense if you're actually paying attention.  
Fafner treads a very grey line of moral ambiguity. On the one hand humanity faces extinction by being unable to fight back effectively against a complex lifeform. On the other hand, they can fight to survive even though it requires less than desirable methods to do so. Questions about humanity are then asked in the process. What is the meaning of peace? How far should humans go before their humanity is ""lost""? Do the ends justify the means? Where do we draw the line? 
Fafner has quite a large cast of characters,** but there is something that unites the Fafner pilots: they all display signs of Savant Syndrome in some way. This, too, is how they are chosen to be pilots. Individuals with signs of Savant Syndrome may display abilities that are far beyond the norm in some aspect. For example, Kazuki has athletic prowess, his ability going far beyond the others in his age group. Maya has keen observational skills, to the point where she can deduce a person's feelings simply through their gestures/behaviors. There is the implication that she can climb rock faces without safety equipment just because she will instinctively understand the most effective way to do so after seeing its face.  
Fafner is a series where the character's are of great significance and often drive it forward. Existentialism is one of the biggest aspects of this series, most frequently manifesting itself in the form of the question: ""Are you there?"" Variations on this are asked and stated by the characters throughout the series as well.  
And here, I will now make a point of stating why I find the confusion of the earlier episodes to actually be worth something of value in this series. Whether it was intentional or not, this sense of disorientation, or confusion, that the viewer is subjected to in these early episodes is likely to be eerily similar to the feelings that the characters within the series are experiencing towards the situation as well. Suddenly, these characters are thrust into an absurd world that they do not understand. As such, I see what we experience as the viewer as being a mirror for what the characters themselves are experiencing since we, too, are effectively thrust into this absurd world. What makes this really interesting to think about is that an individual's beginning in existential thought starts with a sense of confusion, and this confusion that is created within us (as the viewer) at what is happening during these early episodes is actually quite ingenious if it was intentionally done, which I'm inclined to believe was in fact the case. Still, some of the writing choices needed more polishing in these earlier episodes.  
Often we can see a character's struggle for identity and meaning in their absurd world. I will use Kazuki specifically as an example to further illustrate more on the aspect of existentialism and Being and Nothingness within the series. Kazuki routinely denies himself and his existence as a result of his past with Soshi, where he believes he scarred and left Soshi's left eye blind. This is an act of bad faith and Kazuki's denial of his past can be seen as his leading an inauthentic way of life in that he is not living in accordance with his freedom. Fafner, as a series, can be seen as the story of Kazuki ""creating"" himself and then subsequently acting in accordance with this self that he has created. He will act freely as who he is and live an authentic existence, and he will not act as something he is not or blame his actions on something or someone else. Kazuki struggles to find the meaning to his life, and, he eventually comes to realize that what he wants more than anything is to protect his family and friends on his island homeland. Soshi cannot pilot a Fafner unit as a result of his left eye being blind which leads Kazuki to think he must do it in his place. But, as a result of Kazuki's journey in the series he will not be defined by what Soshi or anyone else wants him to do or to be, but rather by what he chooses to do and what he is. Kazuki's freedom and that which he is responsible for are connected to one another. 
There is a scene at the end of Episode -- where Kazuki emerges with Mark Sein from a lava pit and breaks out of hardened magma, almost like a ""birth,"" or coming into Being. This is the same episode where he finally confronts his past. This is shortly after he obtained the Salvator-model Fafner Mark Sein which literally represents ""Being."" Kazuki now exists as his current self and no longer replaces it with a past self that does not exist.  
Soshi is a stoic young boy and he was Kazuki's best friend in childhood. Over the course of the series it seems to be implied that Soshi's feelings for Kazuki go beyond mere friendship and it also implies that Kazuki may reciprocate. It leaves it pretty ambiguous though, much like a majority of the relationships in the series, but you'd still have to be blind to miss it. Despite appearing very cold, Soshi's aim above all else is to protect Tatsumiyajima and its residents, possessing strong leadership skills and exceptional judgement. He wants to be a Fafner pilot so he can protect the island, and laments that he unable to do so, having to manage the battle from the Siegfried System instead.  
Koyo is eventually assimilated by the Festum, though he will still help the island as a Slave Type Festum, meaning he actually still possesses some of his own will over the assimilation. It also represents that humans and Festum can eventually understand one another. At one point he is almost killed by an island resident because of his assimilated state, but the realization that ""Festum don't cry."" saves him as it is understood that he is still, Koyo.  
Maya's presence brings a large of amount of comfort to the character's in the series, particularly Kazuki. She is a gentle, loving girl, and also rather strong-willed, especially when facing the Festum. I'd call her the glue that unites everyone together, her overall importance to the story being of the utmost significance. She would do anything for her friends, even if a great burden is forced on her in the process. The characters are probably one of Fafner's strongest elements and are some of the most well-developed I've come across. I'd like to talk about more, but for now I'll hold off.  
When a character dies in Fafner, they never disappear from the story. They may be gone, but they are never forgotten; they are always remembered. This creates a strong sense of unity between our characters and it makes their affection for one another have an authentic feel to it. People die in Fafner. A lot of people. No one is safe, no matter who they are in the story, they can die at any time. Death can be sudden and unexpected, but it comes anyway. Even so, the deceased will still have a roll to play within the narrative as their memory is lovingly held within the hearts of the living. Even if a character dies they are and were always—there. Hope remains ever-present within Fafner's story.  
The meaning of life and death is explored extensively as well. The Core of the island, Soshi's sister, Tsubaki, teaches the Mir about what it means to live and die, a concept that it has no understanding of within the series. She represents a Valkyrie.   
There is a scene in Episode -- that manages to perfectly encapsulate everything Fafner wants to say in the most brilliant fashion. To this day this scene is one that sticks with me because of how well-executed and genuinely heartfelt it was. An attack is launched against Tatsumiyajima by those who want it eradicated since the Festum, being a hive-mind, are learning new strategies and tactics from their encounters with them. At this point, Canon, is forced to make a decision, by her own free will. Kazuki, comes out to face her, but instead of doing so in battle, he does so in spirit. Canon has lost everything in life—she has no family, no friends, and still worse, no identity to call her own. Is she really there?, the series asks. As a means to cope, she has shut all things off, living only to follow the orders she is given, even if that order means her own death. She is incapable of making choice. She won't make one. Canon, holding the key to whether Tatsumiyajima will survive or not faces Kazuki and rather than engaging in an all-out battle with her, Kazuki simply talks to her, facing one another in their machines—facing one another, not in combat, but by facing each other's hearts. This is not something that Canon is mentally suited towards given her circumstances. She is ""broken"" and doesn't believe she has any real thing to call her own. She believes that she does not exist anywhere. She will be able to easily follow an order that leads to the deaths of a lot of people because she is empty, so she can't really understand.  
This is one scene where I really have to hand it to the voice actors because the emotion, the pain, and the genuine desire to understand one another is palpable. In this encounter there is another thing that needs to be understood, the two are in their Fafner units, units that I've said heighten the survival instincts and the darker emotions found in humans. Rage, anger, hatred, you name it, the Fafner units are a stimulus to bring it out and make their pilots fight better. By all means Canon should probably be flying into a violent rage. But she's not; she's getting angry, but she's struggling. The fact that she is pushing herself so hard and that she is being pushed so hard, that she is being forced to make a choice for herself is a testament to how desperate she was for someone to reach out to her; to just try listening to her. Being in such internal turmoil that all she needed was someone to hear her and to realize she was here with that alone being proof enough that she was, in fact, there.  
Kazuki implores her to make the decision for herself and if she doesn't then he will disappear with her placing her in a situation where she now has someone who has shown that they do care about her well-being. She's not alone and she deserves to be here and experience the emotions that everyone else does. Tears stream down as she begs for Kazuki to tell her what she should do. He refuses, telling her to make the choice herself. So, she does. She makes a decision of her own.  
In this scene there is no blood, there is no violence, and no one dies. There are only two people who manage to understand one another despite being on initially opposing sides. Canon makes a choice for herself; thus, Canon is someone; she is Canon; she is the only one of herself in existence; no one can replace her because she is the only one who can be uniquely her. She is a seemingly hopelessly broken individual, who with the help of others, slowly begins to pick up the shattered fragments of herself and piece them back together.  
She is here.  
This scene hits the existential aspect of the series, while simultaneously showing fighting is not what is needed to allow humans to understand one another. It seems to want to represent that we are all human, we can all understand each other if we try, and we can be there to help one another when it is needed. Canon eventually becomes a resident of Tatsumiyajima, and is adopted by Yoko Hazama who had previously adopted Shoko. Initially feeling like she doesn't belong on the island she eventually grows to love it. She has found hope, despite her past suffering.

Best word to describe this anime? Solid. 
Solid characters. 
Solid plot. 
Solid action. 
Maybe a little over-rated (OK considering the hype machine definitely over-rated), but still DEFINITELY worth your time. If you're looking for something that completely redefines the genre - this ain't it. It's not going to expand your thoughts on moral/philosophical concepts. It's not going to make you have these deep emotional connections to characters you'll find relatable. It's just fun. It's the kind of anime that anime snobs will turn up their noses at, but you can binge watch and walk away from it at the end without thinking you wasted your time (well, not anymore than binge-watching any other show makes you think you wasted your time).

The story is about a -- year old former biker Onizuka Eikichi who wants to become a teacher. His teaching ways are not usual ones, he is sent to teach class --- who is famous of driving teachers away from school because of their horrible past, but that means nothing to Onizuka and he never gives up on his students and is always there for them, ready to risk with his own life for them. 
The art is old but that just makes the enjoyment better, I personally don't believe those ""funny faces"" would work out with the art that is highly detailed. 
Openings and Endings, both worth to listen, anime itself uses many sounds and voices in order to make it more enjoyable, every time someone if someone is up to something or something is happening to them then there is a rather funny face and voice in mind rather than getting mad and start over reacting. 
All characters uniquely interesting, every students uses his own tricks to fight against Onizuka, but that means nothing to the teacher because he is going to be the Greatest Teacher in Japan. He makes his students deal with their problems, he makes them to stand up to their own problems, if he has seen enough commitment he will act. Onizuka always tends to get into trouble, but he is always able to come out from them, he is not liked by other teachers besides Fuyutsuki-sensei who might have crush on him. 
The enjoyment is abnormally good, in every episode there is something you can laugh at, he just doesn't make school fun for students, but also for viewers. 
In overall, I rate this --/--. There aren't many anime that make you want to rather have people like this around you instead of being a person like this yourself. ""I want to be a teacher. The greatest teacher ever..."" -Onizuka Eikichi. He lives up to his own words.

""Everybody Hates Naofumi"" is your obligatory seasonal Isekai that went viral just like its predecessors because it tried to bring something else to the table. This time, its not about time travel but the victimization of our protagonist in the most exaggerated (and almost comical) way imaginable. But before we get to the ""twist"" that made this show unlike any other Isekai you've seen, let's take a moment to talk about the elephant in the room: the protagonist everybody hates in the story, including me.  
Naofumi, your ordinary Otaku, gets summoned to a fantasy world against his will. Instead of actually voicing his opinion on the matter, he accepts it instead, unlike the - other heroes who immediately frowned after being teleported, or should I say ""abducted"" at this point. At first, Naofumi seems your typical self-insert protagonist who gets all the waifus and lolis while treating them as they were mere ""prizes"" he can collect and show off to the viewer, without actually making any move. But then we get to the ""twist"", which this time is a false rape accusation that was randomly thrown away without any actual context or motive. Apparently, almost all the characters in this show victimize the protagonist and treat him like garbage because of rumors about the ""Shield Hero"" being a horrible person. Then why exactly did you summon him in the first place? Why not execute him after falsely accusing him without any evidence whatsoever?  
Needless to say, Naofumi, who was first presented as an atypical protagonist who doesn't do any of the cliches mentioned previously, becomes your typical protagonist who does ALL of the cliches mentioned previously in just - episodes. But this time everything is excused, since he was victimized and everybody who doesn't side with him is immediately labelled as villain. No matter what he says or does, it makes sense to the viewer who immediately sides with him without actually taking his actions and decisions into consideration. 
Some of his decisions are questionable as they raise some serious ethical questions, like his idea of buying a loli slave. Why exactly does it have to be a loli? Couldn't be something less pathetic and more adequate for a fantasy world, like an animal companion? Later on, he decides to buy an actual animal as means for transportation. But that exact animal turns into a loli too for no other reason than to pander people's fetishes. There is nothing wrong with having a harem, loli or any other type of fanservice element as long as its relevant to the genre. When I decide to watch a fantasy anime, I'm not exactly expecting constant arguing between the waifus over the protagonist. I'm also not expecting random lolis who add nothing to its story and development. In fact, the only reason why I decided to watch this show in the first place was because everybody was saying how different and refreshing it is. Is it? 
As the story progresses, Naofumi begins to feel like any other overpowered, know-it-all protagonist since he never looses, even when the enemy is clearly cheating or way beyond his level. Not to mention the fact that he was presented, from the very first beginning, as the weakest among the heroes since he can only use a shield. Apparently, this shield turns out to be a devastating plot device he can use to heal, damage, trap or block enemies.  
Everything and everyone is in Naofumi's favor, since he is the victim in the story for poorly explained reasons. I'm guessing it has something to do with a devilish curse, but it all feels too contrived. From the false accusation to the slave loli to the typical harem.  
You might as well call him ""Kirito, but this time its more tragic"".  
The pacing is absurdly fast sometimes, like when Raphtalia turns from a weak, shy and sensitive loli to a tsundure, jealous and badass ---year old girl in just one episode or when Filo rapidly grows up in just one day. And all of this fast progression is shown using a slideshow of images, which honestly felt more like a PowerPoint presentation to me. Really? That's not character development. Its more of a skipping in order to rush Naofumi's harem. 
Other times, the pacing is purposefully dragged out for the sake of fillers. You have a fight between Naofumi and another Hero over who gets to keep the loli, and it is used to victimize Naofumi even further by making EVERY single character in the episode hate him. You have a risky pointless adventure where they go looking for magical crystals just to make a special dress for Filo (She constantly transforms into a loli, remember?).  
World building is almost non existent. Everything is presented as a video game even thought it isn't (the protagonist gets summoned after opening a book that describes the fantasy world he's trapped in, and not after playing a video game or something). The protagonist even has an interactive UI at his disposal he can use to upgrade his weapons or view his stats. So it actually is an alternate reality video game after all. Moreover, the world is a copy-paste of what you'd expect to find in any Isekai anime. If I took a random screenshot of this fantasy world and showed it to people next year, they wouldn't be able to tell which Isekai anime it is. In fact, they will probably think its next year's Isekai anime. That's how dull, unimpressive and repetitive the world seems to me.  
""Everybody Hates Naofumi"" is no different from any other Isekai you've seen for the last - years. The only reason you feel like its different and refreshing is because the writer tries his best to convince you that it is, while pouring the exact same elements scavenged from different Isekais over the years into the mixer and calling it a day. He's the perfect example of a seller convincing you to buy a product you already have and seen (OP protagonist and his harem) by telling you its different (victimizing the protagonist for the sake of plot armoring everything and everyone around him). But this victimization which was too exaggerated to the point that it became irritating is more than enough to fool the average viewer into thinking this time its different. 
It's not.

This a review of only the first half of Fate/Zero 
Fate/Zero is the prequel to the VN Fate/Stay Night. Set during the -th Holy Grail War, Fate/Zero lived up to what i expected but more. I had watched part of studio Deen's adaptation of Fate/Stay Night and ufotable's Fate/Stay night Unlimited blade works and thought i should give Fate/Zero a try.  
Story: 
Fate/Zero take place during the -th Holy Grail War, -- years before the events of Fate/Stay Night. The grail selects - master to take part in the war by assigning each master a servant. The story take itself very seriously and very well written The servants all are based on past heroic spirits. The main plot of the story is simple with each master and servant having their own desire for the grail. But the depth of the characters is what really stands out.  The story starts out with battle between servants, but slows down toward the  end of the first half explaining the motives a bit more. 
Characters: 
Fate/Zero focuses heavily on the depth of the characters. From learning about the past of the heroic spirits or the desire and planning the Master provides. Fate/Zero does a good job not letting any of the characters feel like they are a side character and make the holy grail war feel more like a free for all. The way the character are described make you feel there is not really a main villain except maybe for caster and his master but I wont go into that much else 
Art and Sound: 
The style is great for Fate/Zero and very well done. The battle that happen are very intense and the emotion in the characters really show it in the art. It is up to standard of what a ---- and maybe even better. The sound effects are very realistic and soothing. The OP and ED are great too. 
Fate/Zero is a great anime that is not to be taken lightly. The feel of this anime very different from Fate/Stay night (from what I've watched) The show makes sure that the characters stay relevant and that none of them are left out like a support character. The show i feel gets dull during a part where the motives  are being explained but there is little to no action. Its a series to watch if you want a strong character development and awesome battles. Ufotable did a great job at this adaptation and can not say much more about that.

Great movie. Its action packed with the great humor of the Trigun series. The animation is slightly updated since this came out a lot later than the series, but the characters are exactly how you'd remember them. It made me laugh a bunch of times and kept me entertained throughout the whole thing. I'd definitely recommend it to anime fans.

This anime isn't too bad, just a little boring and slow. Even though one would expect an -- episode series to feel fast. 
The story is intresting but not touched upon enough. There is so many pauses in the series just talking about a character's morals instead of actual story. The characters basically are just written as big sacks of morals and nothing else. most of the characters just seem so robotic and just desighned to think a certain way about a subject, but have no personality at all. This is not true about the main character. He is actually well defined and feels human. Even though I would consider him above average intelligence, I would not say he is a genius. most of his tricks he tries to get him out of trouble a moreso crazy, than smart. But they are crazy enough to work. He is great to watch and somewhat salvages the series. 
The artwork for locations is top notch however character designs range from mediocre to repulsive. Mainly the facial expressions can be repulsive. 
The soundtrack isnt very memorable. Dont expect anything good or bad from this. 
My reccommendation for this is very low. -- eposodes isnt to big of a waste of your life if you dont enjoy it.

So we got -- linear episodes of gintama, were they good or not, we'll see. 
I will be rating ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represent LN or manga. 
\\ spoiler alert just in case // 
Art: -/-- 
Let's be honest, it is very likely that you have watched Gintama before, if you did you know it didn't really changed it's artwork, if you are new I'll say it's good and it stays similar to prequels and go watch them before ---- ( specifically Gintama ----,  so you will understand events) 
Characters: -/-- 
less is sometimes more. If you have watched prequels there's no need to introduce our MC's, if you are new I'll give a quick synopsis of their current situation. Our MC Sakata Gintoki is an ex samurai who is currently in hiding from shogun's forces, his results on battlefield earned him a nickname "" white devil"". Our -nd MC is Kagura, an alien, she is from Yato, which are super strong humans, she has a pet Sadaharu and is currently trying to settle a conflict between her brother and father. Our -rd MC Shinpachi and he acts like a "" normal"" human comparing to our other characters, trying to use logic, which usually doesn't work out. There are way less characters than in prequels, which is better it helps story to be focusd. 
Character progression: -/-- 
Some details about are antagonists are shown, Kagura's family gets some development, overall it's really good for -- episodes, maybe a little too much. 
Story: -/-- 
I'll be softer, becuse it's a comedy. Full linear season is an achievement for Gintama. This season is deciding battle between our MC's and our antagonists, between Kagura's family and this season is packed with lot of action, it's isn't getting -, because Gintama staff should choose if they want a serious story or just comedy, because both won't work, there are some good comedy moments and there are some bad comedy moments. Overall it's really close to -, but because everyone has a different taste on comedy aspects I'll lower it to -. 
Story progression: -/-- 
There are a lot of backstories, which isn't a bad thing, but I think there should have been more episodes in this season to cover those backstories, because their quantity in -- episode is little too much and it can be bother to watch in between the action scenes. 
Villains: -/-- 
Utsuro: -/-- Former mentor of Gintoki, he's immortal and is looking for a way to die, he ends up blowing a lot of terminals infused with stuff similar to nuclear energy causing deaths of many and turning a big part of the univers against earth, so that's quite an achievement. For a long time he was fighting with his good alter ego, but he won, when Gintoki was forced to execute his mentor in his "" good state"" in order to save his comrades. 
Comedy: -/-- 
It should be decided whether to focus on serious story or comedy, because having both factors infused in - doesn't often work like you though it would and here it is the case, it has a good comedy times, but Gintama should decide it path. 
Sound: -/-- 
With less episodes comes less openings and endings obviously, but overall both opening and endings to Gintama ---- were pretty good. 
So overall rating of Gintama. of Gintama ---- is -/-- exact. It should decide it course before it crashes, people says it's quality is going down, if I compare this review to my Gintama ---- review it worsens from -,-/-- to -/--, I did personally enjoyed the linear story, but I have to agree it is going down in quality.

I really fell in love with this anime for many reasons. It's not like any other generic romance comdey anime. Its so very unique in its own way. I love the comedy its filled with laughter. The comedy is actually good. Also the relationship and build up of love between the characters was executed well. The art is no FANTASTIC but drawn this way it fits the comedic style, it was good. I so much enjoyed this series alot. This puts alot of other romance comedy animes to shame. Usually they will be a little funny in the beginning then as it progresses lose that fun and its more serious. Overall -/-- it was a great experience watching this anime!

I usually tend not to add hentai-related content to my list, but this one in particular didn't have the genre listed on it. I wouldn't say that it should though, as Nana to Kaoru isn't exactly your typical hentai-related OVA. Infact, upon completing it, I may even continue to the manga to see how the rest goes. From that type of reaction it's understandable that maybe it wasn't all bad, or generic, and it might even come to mind that maybe this OVA doesn't feel whole or contains much closure. Both of those would be correct, but experiencing the OVA all on its own isn't something those who are experience-seekers should pass up. Nana to Kaoru could definitely just be some masturbating material, but it could also be a very odd experience for those who enjoy them. 
On the technical side of things, Nana to Kaoru looks good and carries some great animation. A lot of that animation is ecchi-related, but that should be something to expect anyways. The sound is pretty good with music that varies from typical hentai slow electronics to more classy-styled music. The sound effects are on the better side of things as, when considering sound, whatever's happening will have a consistent noise that sticks out as it goes on. The sound plays a large part in the intrigue as well as it tells you in a way what the characters are doing, at times, without presenting it to you. It's a more subtle way of doing things that becomes more effective in the atmosphere as a whole. 
The characters and their psyche is where most of the entertainment is as they will act in odd ways or go into deep thought while doing erotic acts. The inner-monologues of the main female character explains situations down to the smallest detail in a way that manages to be particularly interesting. The other character, who does the actions more and lacks inner monologue, makes an interesting contrast as you have to read him through his acts instead. He will act in specific ways that make him seem very forceful at times while also seeming very shy, and nervous, at others. It's a great coupling of interaction that manages to make the whole OVA's run-time engaging with only the use of a few props, while only taking place in a single bedroom. 
It sounds like the manga goes in a slightly different direction that makes you feel differently about the characters, but for what this OVA is on its own, how it carried out its characters isn't particularly bad. There's definitely a lack in the plot-department as there's basically no story, but Nana to Kaoru really feels more in tune with the experience than anything else. The characters are great in that they manage to pull off believably strange personalities that feel very conflicted, while also being contrasted by trying to tell the viewer or trying to hide it. The visuals are great and the sound is sufficient in carrying out its goal. Nana to Kaoru is definitely possible masturbation material for some, but that doesn't mean the OVA as a whole is meaningless and a waste of time. It can be watched in a different manner that allows for something rather interesting and different. It does lack a satisfactory ending, however, that would likely make one have to turn to the manga to feel fully that they had a complete experience. Even so, to an extent the situation that goes on in this OVA does feel that it carried out the purpose that the OVA intended and it didn't feel that it was incomplete in that aspect. Overall, watch Nana to Kaoru if you're looking into having a less than normal afternoon. 
+ Recommended for a family viewing.

Ohh.. This classic. Some people extremely likes it. Some people extremely hates it. 
(Some little spoilers ahead) 
""The God is among us"" wasn't such a new concept even for the season it got released (Bruce Almighty was - years old when TMoHS was airing for example). Not that it means we cannot get an interesting plot here. But this series took that concept and managed to make it extremely unbearable, illogical and boring somehow. Why? Well, let us ask some questions to the show itself: 
------ 
RS: So what do we have here TMoHS? 
TMoHS: We are given a concept of the non self-aware ""God"" that can manipulate or destroy the world. 
RS: Non self-aware..? What do you mean by that? 
TMoHS: The God is actually a self-centered high school girl that has no consciousness of her mighty powers. 
RS: That's cool. Oh wait.. Self-centered? Can you describe her personality a bit more? 
TMoHS: She is basically a selfish total bitch that has no moralities and takes any step she can to achieve anything. 
RS: Literally, Holy fuck! That sounds like a total badass concept as a thriller or horror! 
TMoHS: Thriller?.. Horror? We are focused on comedy. 
RS: Comedy? I mean, we are speaking of a selfish deity here.. That sounds pretty much catastrophic and dark itself. I am just imagining this non self-awared God causing massive deaths over some school problems, then does apocalyptic damages to the world she lives in. After she realises her divine powers, her mind either gets some sense in it or maybe goes full postal to destroy the entire existence. 
TMoHS: Probably. We did mention that she already altered the world before. But this isn't our focus. So interpret that part however you want to... 
RS: Yeah i will, but here is the problem: you just scratched that important part somewhere in the story and throw it away as, ""yeah some deep stuff happened""? Not even a framework or mention on what happened back then? That could be interesting to watch, idk.. 
TMoHS: It is up to you to interpret it. 
RS: Okay anyways, interpretions has no importance with what you present in the first place. Go on, tell me what you did instead.. 
TMoHS: Well you see, we have this type of deity character called Haruhi. She is bored with her school and classes. After some talk with Kyon on her class, she dedicates herself on a club to search for some supernatural cases like aliens, robots or timetravellers exc.. 
RS: Alright.. So do they appear? A God wills it whatsoever.. 
TMoHS: That is the interesting part! Yes they actually do. Two humanoid aliens and a one time traveller joins on her club. 
RS: Oh then she recognizes their existence.. Then all of them go on space and do some time travel and stuff? 
TMoHS: Not.. Really.. 
RS: ? Huh? 
TMoHS: They pretty much spend their time around sanitizing her mentality on the club. But she isn't aware that two of them are humanoids and one of them is a time traveller. 
RS: Okay hold up.. Something is completely inaccurate here.. She is not awared of them? How? Why? A God willed to encounter oddities and create a club just for it; for some reason, they appear; but she is somehow not aware of them? What is the logic behind this? 
TMoHS: But she encountered them technically.. 
RS: But in her mind she didn't..? 
TMoHS: Not like she didn't encounter anything else. What about the crime case..? 
RS: Not even really close.. 
TMoHS: What about the disappearance of one of the students? 
RS: These are indeed unusual, but not really supernatural. Well, Haruhi and Kyon were been into the Haruhi's corruped world once and she was aware of it. Why not the other cases are not this direct? How her wills even work on this world? Is it only extremely direct when the case suits it? 
TMoHS: Uhhh.. 
RS: And other important aspects you don't even point out..What would happen if any of them commited deicide or the God somehow died? What would happen if any of the characters put the embodyment of the deity into a coma? Even she has divine powers how much is she protected?.. Or is it impossible for her to be harmed from any of this because it is her fate? Do characters have no will to think about this or they are just really dumb? Why did she even created this world in the first place if she would be bored again? 
TMoHS: It is up to you to interpret it. 
RS: Come on now.. You put some huge consept like ""unaware God"" and don't even bother with filling these tiny details? 
TMoHS: Well i still made you think. Didn't i? 
RS: Okay okay.. I do enjoy to talk about this philosophical stuff even it is flawled in few points. I'll give you that TMoHS. But you told me you wanted to do a tiny different approach to it right? 
TMoHS: Right! 
RS: Okay tell me about other characters on.. this useless club a damn deity decided to built instead of something more interesting a deity could do. 
TMoHS: Reminder that she isn't aware of her powers... 
RS: This club doesn't even do anything in particular.. And not really understanding why a school would allow such ridiculousness. Teachers can put a stop to her weird bunnysuit thing but not this? The world herself created and her powers make absolute no sense. 
TMoHS: Sigh.. Okay, back to other characters; we have the male lead Kyon. He is the one who inspired Haruhi to create the club after the chit-chats they had. He can be snarky and sarcastic depending on situations. 
RS: Oh so he can effect that deity.. 
TMoHS: Yeah. 
RS: I agree and disagree with you there. 
TMoHS: What do you mean? 
RS: Kyon is indeed probably the most effective and non linear character you have brought so far. But tell me, why didn't you make him more morally constructive? He could elevate Haruhi to be more sensible but why all he does is boosting her ego and has absolute no effect on her morality? Don't give me that ""It is his character"" thingy. It is not hard to understand that her morality is extremely crucial to keep the world in good pace. If he is not a total moron, he would most likely act according to that point. 
TMoHS: ... 
RS: But even that aside, Kyon is unfortunately even less influential or even less likeable character than others claim. His effects are only few sparks on Haruhi to trigger some events. He has no other impact at all. And his personality.. He is just the worst (Yes even than Haruhi). For instance, that blackmailing Haruhi did on the computer club.. Maybe Mikuru was aware that she were the God and there is nothing she could do to go against her.. Why.. Why did Kyon sway that incident with some poor ""Is this supposed to be comedy?"" line and pretend that it never happened? Either Kyon is just morally corrupted or he is just another puppet in Haruhi's big puppet show. Nonetheless, he sucked so bad.. 
TMoHS: I guess you never liked Mikuru then.. 
RS: She is just the embodyment of fanservice. Haruhi forcing her to dress stupid shit is just entirely unfunny on its own. I personally find her squeaky and crybaby voice annoying. And her timetravel conclusion.. Kinda makes sense but still, that was kinda bland to be honest here. 
TMoHS: What about Itsuki? 
RS: A puppet babling much more than it should. Why does he even bother with what he is doing at all? I don't make any sense of it. If he wanted to fight against ""Haruhi's stress"" or something, he could do the same as Kyon or maybe put some chillpills in her drink while she is not looking instead. That would be more logical. 
TMoHS: Uhhuuh.. 
RS: His existence is pointless overall. 
TMoHS: Yuki? 
RS: Ｂｅｅｐ． Ｂｏｏｐ． Ｅｘｐｏｓｉｔｉｏｎ． Ｂｅｅｐ． Ｂｏｏｋｓ． Ｒｅａｄｉｎｇ ｓｅｑｕｅｎｃｅ ｉｎｉｔｉａｔｅｄ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ． Ｔｕｒｎ ｐａｇｅ． 
TMoHS: So you didn't like this show? 
RS: An annoying deity, her boring/irrational world and her useless puppets. I guess not a show for me. It gives some good stuff to discuss thou. 
TMoHS: What about the other aspects? The sound effects, musics or animation? 
RS: Now okay hands down, i quite like the soundtrack of this show. So many jazzy tunes here. ""itsumo no fuukei"" is definitely sounds like ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" by Dj Thomas tho. Coincidental or not, it sounds awesome. 
In artistic perspective the colors are blended well. Animation looks smooth in places. 
TMoHS: I keep my puppets clean! 
RS: Ahahahaha! 
------ 
Overall: the concept feels like it has been directed with the most incompatible style, maybe its genre and characters just doesn't fit with each other at all (it doesn't even feel like the characters were decently crafted). In philosophical aspect, it has huge dents in it (still can spark a good discussion). In humorous aspect, it is just a total fail for me. Some might like, i just don't.

One Piece may be considered the best perpetual ongoing shounen of all times, but its first anime adaptation was actually a short OVA, aiming to promote it and subtly prepare the way for the main series to begin next year. Strangely enough it is made by an entirely different studio, and for that reason it also has a very different animation style, as well as voice actors. 
I have heard from most viewers how they didn’t like it because it looks weird and has different voices but these reasons are mostly aesthetic since we were accustomed to the Toei style. It is not bad at all for the year it was made and actually has some very good names in the production team. Studio I.G. has far better budgets than Toei and poured enough in this short to make it look ok. The director of it was Taniguchi Gorou, and this was also his first wok. Later on he went on to direct many other famous/cult anime, such as Infinite Ryvius, Planetes, and Code Geass. As for the voice actors, the villain is voiced by none other than Wakamoto Norio, one of the most distinguished and cherished ones in the field. 
All the bright people in the world though are not enough to make a good omelette out of rotten eggs, and it is true that the plot is too short and simple to mean anything. In just half an hour, we get a more than linear story of the gang having to beat a pirate for food. It also plays out quite anti-climactically, as there are only three of them, they don’t even have their first ship yet (just a small boat) and the villain just wants to build a ship and a base. Not that the later movies were doing a much better job but at least offered a bit more time to building up the tension and fleshing out the secondary cast a bit. Yet here we have this child trying to protect the island and the bad pirate exploiting the population and we barely get anything worth remembering them about. And seriously, having a kid asking from the heroes to help turned out to be an overused and lame trope for the franchise. 
Now something regarding the pirate Ganzack. Aside from being a filler character without a backdrop that we will never see again, he is also a very weird blend of various cannon villains. He has the clothes of Baggy, and the mechanical weaponry of Don Krieg. And if I stretch it, since Oda eventually took ideas even from the movies for his later arcs, Ganzack also uses a crab weapon like a very minor pirate captain in Merman Island. But hey, he is voiced by Norio and that alone gives him some style, lol. 
The action scenes are good for their time; simple yet with fluent motions for the most part that make them a bit likable. The problem is, they last too little to get you into the proper mood but they are not bad. The sound part is unimpressive in terms of music and terrible if you can’t get past the different voices the characters have. 
In all, it is quite the passable little OVA but the open minded should accept that it’s well made or how it was meant to promote what was to be the most adorable long-term shounen of them all. 
And now for some excused scorings.

There's really nothing like this. And when i say that, you can be ---% sure. If you're an anime fan, it's a crime and a shame if you didn't watch Rainbow: nisha rokubou no shichinin.  This anime is what everyone should look when they start watching TV series.  
The story is absolutely amazing from the beginning to the end. Really nothing to bitch about, i didn't notice any flaws. It's very well executed and gives a bunch of  emotions. 
The Art is also very good, the ----s are represented the way they should be, nothing less. I was like teleported to those years, the atmosphere was so believable. 
The Sound is a big thanks to Madhouse. The opening has one of the most memorables songs in any anime. And just the music in anime is only a plus to the existing atmosphere. 
The Characters are likeable from the first episode and really set in the mind of the viewer that this is gonna be a great journey. Every character is dealing with his own personality and has his episodes. Thats what creates this show, the thing that it focuses on more characters that follow the same route. 
Overall this is what i can call AN ANIME. A true work of art and i give all my respect to the original writer and Madhouse for executing the series so well.

While the ending was rather abrupt, I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  
The premise of this anime is simple: the main female protagonist, whom is the president of the student council, has a secret that she doesn't want anyone at her formerly all-boys high school to find out about. And of course the main male protagonist discovers her secret in due course. Shenanigans then ensue. The plot isn't unique but it does offer a lot of amusing moments and natural chemistry between the two main character. The ending was disappointing but that was one of the few problems I had with this series. It captured my attention from the start and my mind didn't wander from the events taking place before my very eyes.  
It is for this reason that I give the story a nine out of ten.  
I enjoyed the art for this series. Takumi Usui appears on many lists for sexiest guys in anime and for good reason. The character designs for the most part are realistic and I felt that they matched the characters personalities well. The characters each had their own unique appearance and for that reason they were easy to distinguish.  
I give the art an eight out of ten.  
I particularly enjoyed Usui's seiyuu (Nobuhiko Okamoto) for the simple reason that the voice matched the person so well. The opening theme is a guilty pleasure of mine because of its light hearted nature.  
I give the sound an eight out of ten. 
This anime focuses primarily on the development of the two main characters Misaki and Usui and how they grow closer together. At the start, they are depicted as practically flawless but they have their own problems which I feel was addressed well. Misaki's reactions were very amusing! And Usui's facial expressions cracked me up every time. The Baka trio while amusing at times could often be annoying. Other characters in the series don't develop to the extent of Misaki and Usui unfortunately (or so I felt anyway).  
For this reason I give the characters aspect of the show a seven out of ten. 
I recommend this series if you want to watch something that is light hearted and entertaining. --/--

This is a review not just of the second season but both -st and -nd seasons together. The reason I do this is because I consider many Gundam series like these to have -- episodes like many of them do. So if you read my first review of Gundam --, this is a modified/continuation. It's been a long run since Gundam SEED but this series was far better. Though I wouldn't say it was great, it didn't really disappoint me. The story of this series follows the same formula as Gundam Wing, bunch of girly looking guys piloting overly powerful mechs for a rebellious cause. So lets break it down shall we? 
The Story of this series was decent. Political intrigue was great since that's what most Gundam series should have. Many of the Characters had okay back stories, but I'll explain them later, and the story didn't go off course. The problem I noticed is that though it had these redeeming features it still felt like I was watching Gundam SEED. It was excessively flashy. The Gundam concepts with Trans-AM and super beam sabers that can take down a fleet of ships just didn't make sense. They are never explained and seem so surreal. Any Gundam fan would agree that many of these elements were really unneeded, and the series would continue to flow even without those...""things"". When the series began, the GN drives (the energy source of the Gundams) were rarely explained and just lead to more questions. The same goes for the whole purpose of the Celestial Being cause. We know they were a secret military force made by a man, Aeolia Schenberg, that was to fight off and prevent Wars. Whoopty doo... but it was nothing but plot holes that make you think what the hells going on, but if you have ADD you become distracted with the Flashy battle scenes instead of noticing it. 
The Characters of the series is another topic I want to explain as well. Many of their personalities switch back and forth making your wonder what the hell is going on. Character development in this series isn't one of it's strongest points. Some characters never have any development at all, i.e. Allelujah Haptism. As the series progresses to it's final battle, their importance to the series becomes less apparent and all the focus changes to Setsuna. Yes, I understand that he is the main character but if I do recall this series is about - Gundam pilots, not one. And how is it that only Setsuna reaches the next step in human evolution but not the others, dam I just gave a spoiler. As I continued to watch this series, there was barely any serious interactions between characters. Oh, there was that one time that Anew...blah blah blah, that doesn't count. It's a formulated Gundam storyline, that's what it is. Yes I say this because I've seen it happen over and over again.  
Art and Sound, pretty well done. I like the designs of many of the mobile suits, and I can't wait to see the MSVs (Mobile Suit Variations) of them. I am totally digging the intros and end themes as well. I like UVERworld, and L'arc~en~Ceil. I always find myself putting them on my MP- every time I turn it on. I would be a better music critic if I could but I'm just not that kind of person. Anyways, back to Art. Character concepts for all the characters were decent. Of course, after Gundam Wing, all of our Gundam pilots have to look like girls, just because to create a larger female interest in the series. I can totally see many of them end up in some Hentai or Yaoi magazine (pretty sure they already are), like those from Gundam SEED Destiny. Like I said of the Mechs, they are pretty cool, but like Gundam SEED they are really flash and seem to have so many unneeded attributes attached to their bodies.  
In the end of all this epic sword swingin', trash talkin', and totally confused adolescence screaming, I was able to sigh in relief that the series was over. I knew if it continued any further, It'd probably change into it's own kind of monster. I did enjoy it, don't get me wrong. I would prefer this series over Gundam SEED any day. I wouldn't count on it as the best or greatest of the Gundam anthology. As far as New Gundam series it should bring in a lot of new comers for the franchise and probably have more people to talk about it, and I like that. I'm looking forward to the new Gundam -- installment that's coming out next year if you hadn't herd, that's another spoiler I guess. What I am really wishing for is that they would reanimate the original series and air it on TV, calling it Mobile Suit Gundam HD Remix (Like Street Fighter II HD Remix Turbo, lol), like that will ever happen. My ending conclusion is, it's worth watching, but you'll know it's not something to die over, figuratively speaking. 
Yours Truly

P.S. Don't be messin' with Zakus...

This OVA is just bad. Nothing to really say--it's just bad. The only reason I watched it was so me and my friend could laugh at how horrible the art was and that we had no clue what was going on. I have made animations better than this.  
The second OVA wasn't /as/ bad, but it was still, well, bad. 
I only recommend this if you want to see something hilariously horrible.

Tis crap. 
The colors are flat, dull and vibrant at the same time. 
story, what story? some smuck with no personality with a ""rudolph the red nosed phallus"" casualy mulches his - poorly designed relatives. 
the ""sister"" has this terrifying green hair. aunt/mom/thing is better... not really. the other aunt/mama/whatever is the best charctor designed in my oppinion. 
nothing holds me when watching this. the lines are sharp but the whole thing looks inferior. 
the only driving force you will even find in this is the overused incest theme, not even remotely intresting. well maybe a little but seriously dont waste your time on this one. 
that is my review. its not much but im tring to do you a solid and steer you away from crap hentai like this one. 
cheers.

When I started watching Little Busters back from the very first episode in the first season, I was not really satisfied with the plot and character development. At first it seems that the whole season was only filler and there is no actual goal for the plot. The first season almost had me dropping the series because it was too cliche and the story is somewhat predictable. Continuing into the next season, things took quite a turn and the plot became something entirely different. It's like I was watching a different anime because of the shift in the story line. Season - however explained the whole plot of the series in the end and all questions are answered. The ending is great and the drama did its job. Overall, this anime is worth the time so you should check it out if you're into drama and comedy.

Ugh. Where to begin? 
Let's start with the positives. While I'm not a fan of the new style the animation is beautiful, and I enjoy seeing the careful detail put into the animation... 
The message of the movie stays relatively the same. Human bad, nature good. The whole safety VS freedom thing. Though I'd like for them to go for a new message after all the other new stuff I guess it's fine. 
That's about it for the good. 
The story is bad, it'd be good for maybe a crossover between Astro Boy and Jungle Emperor, but with Jungle Emperor alone? No. It's so not Jungle Emperor at all. It's like making a Flintstones movie, but putting the Flintstones into a medieval setting. It's just not right. 
Leo's character is mutilated beyond the point of recognition. Leo is a courageous and smart Lion who believes that all animals have the right to live, similar to his father, Panja.  
This Leo is a cowardly idiot, to put bluntly. 
Isn't it kind of weird how Toto is here, but Bubu is completely absent?  
This would be good if it wasn't supposed to be a Jungle Emperor movie.

This is one of the most disappointing anime I have watched this season. It starts off great with awesome premise and all but leaves you hanging right there. the worst parts of ancient magus bride are the pacing and the overall story , when there seems to be a fight people just summon some random stuff saying some other random stuff which makes some random stuff happen and everything goes just as it should have. Absolutely no rules apply to their magic and tbh it was kinda good in the beginning but man does it get boring , after episode --- it was an utter waste of time. There are some real good things about it though : the sounding is done really well , the op and ed theme songs are really good and the soundtracks used in between are simply perfect . The visuals rock too , really colorful and with details not to mention the amount of animations used but again it gets boring after a while.

Good things I have to say about Hanebado: 
-It was beautifully animated.  
-It brought attention to a sport that doesn't get a lot of attention.  
-Gave us a show about female athletes without making it entirely about fanservice.  
Everything else was generally not good or just not enjoyable for me to watch. I went into this thinking I was going to absolutely love it. I was so ready to fall in love with these characters. And then... I met these characters. I have rarely watched an anime where I found main characters to be quite so unlikable. I kept holding out, not dropping this show in the hopes that they would grow on me. Instead, by the last episode I just felt more frustrated. The story and characters are both just lacking.

Some light spoilers~ 
The melody is, tu-tu-tuuuuuu tu-tu-tuuuuuuu, a lot like love. 
That there is a single line from the opening song of ‘Kids on the Slope’ (‘Sakamichi no Apollon’ in Japanese) titled ‘Sakamichi no Melody’ performed by YUKI. The moment the female singer passionately chirped out, “Melody wa~” which was followed by a mighty trumpet, I knew that Sakamichi could very well be a memorable ride. I had goosebumps. A welcome sign, yes. 
I first came across Sakamichi while bingeing DemolitionD’s ‘Should You Watch’ review series on YouTube. His review of Sakamichi was pretty damn hilarious. The - minutes video had - minutes dedicated to Demo’s classic antics. That was more than a year ago. So, when I watched Sakamichi recently and then hit Demo’s review again, I was surprised how much I did not remember. Thus, you can exhale a breath of relief that this review is not biased. 
The point about bias is quite important, actually. Sakamichi is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe who was also behind such influential works as ‘Cowboy Bebop’ and ‘Samurai Champloo’. Except for the befuddling mess that was ‘Terror in Resonance’, many people simply guffaw over Watanabe’s works upon hearing his name. Personally, I found Cowboy Bebop to be just average while I consider Samurai Champloo to be one of my favorite anime. Space Dandy was pretty damn fun as well. As for Sakamichi… 
I’ll kick off the review by saying that Sakamichi has to be Watanabe’s second best work. It’s not at the level of Samurai Champloo, which is in a class of its own, but it will still manage to leave a strong impression on most viewers – regardless of whether they like Jazz or not. 
I myself am not heavily into Jazz (nor any particular genre for that matter) but I do still appreciate good music. Sakamichi’s use of, what I assume is, classic Jazz cements the base firmly for the plot to easily get into the SWING of things. And, that, it does. 
Sakamichi’s plot is actually quite simple. Cliches and tropes are a-plenty. That doesn’t devalue nor demean the show’s story. Cliches and tropes exist for a reason and that reason is that they work. They are things you just can’t simply throw out of the window just like our main boy character did with the other male lead when he came into his room at night for some sweet boy-loving. Going for a stupid and plot-hole inducing twist in order to seem ‘fresh’ instead of executing tried ideas to perfection is just outright silly, in my opinion. An example would be Angel Beat’s final reveal. It just came completely out of nowhere and brought up a whole series of questions that it did not even attempt to answer even by foreshadowing or whatever. No, ‘Randy Orton: the Anime’, you can fuck off and so can my tears. 
Anyway, the story starts off with classical pianist and socially anxious Kaoru transferring to a highschool in Kyushu where he somehow befriends the local thug-with-a-heart Sentarou using the power of Jazz. As the narrative pushes forward, you find the usual teenage melodrama accompanying the adventures the teens experience over the course of - years in the ----s. There’s lots of drama – most of which is caused by the usual buffoonery of our Kaoru almost always blowing things as much out of proportion as a horndog with his very first blow-up sex doll. This is all supported with excellent musical performances by the cast. The music doesn’t take center stage nor is it made to stand out on the curb in a ‘Top Cat’ costume. 
The story is predictable, of course. It’s a teenage romantic drama. There’s only so much you can do with that certain mix of genres. Thankfully, Sakamichi wonderfully makes use of its setting to expand on it as a whole. The anime feels like a misunderstood kouhai wanting to be noticed by their senpai and managing to succeed at that goal. 
This is not to say that Sakamichi achieves this task flawlessly. The pacing may sometimes drag and sometimes it will jump around much too quickly. This is especially evident with the scenes that concern Jun, Sentarou’s neighbor, and Yukari, Sentarou’s crush. While the scenes deal with a much more serious romantic endeavor, what with Yukari still being in highschool and Jun being a college dropout disowned by his family, they progress faster than the very first episode of ‘Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’ (there’s a confession and kiss in there). Maybe an extra episode could have helped. Or they could have removed some of Kaoru’s idiocy. 
Another not-so-perfect point in regards to Sakamichi’s plot is the ending. It’s just meh. I was all smiles while I was watching it. Then, when I spent the next couple of minutes pondering it over I realized that it wasn’t as special as I initially had thought. Certainly, the very last moment was an absolute oomph when the opening song played to conclude the Jazzy ride but the few scenes before THAT didn’t have weight behind them. Goosebumps be damned! Sakamichi could have been better but it copped out with what I assume the director and writer(s) must have thought to be a true-to-life, and so, bittersweet ending. 
Speaking of bittersweet, I am hungry and, thus, I must end this review. So, onto the technical stuff! 
MAPPA and Tezuka Productions have done an excellent job overall. The animation is standard. The CGI doesn’t suck arse. It’s actually quite fluid. The decision to use such a coloring technique that it nearly matches the gradients of colors of the CGI was a smart move. The character designs are quite expressive as well. When matched with on-point voice actors, the big picture comes together quite nicely. 
I’ve already gone into the Jazz specifics. Enthusiasts may recognize the names and works of Billy Evans and Chet Baker. The background music is alright. Suits the show. The opening and ending songs are fantastic. They build on the character of the anime. As I usually say, “Into the music folder they go,” and that they shall. 
All things considered, Sakamichi scores an -.-/-- from me (rounded off to - for MAL). With some refinement, it could have easily being a --/-- show but it just kind of lost steam towards the end. It also momentarily touched on some rather mature topics such as racism and economical divide but it didn’t use them as junctions where it could find footholds with which to climb higher. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend Kids on the Slope. You might either really like it or just find it dull if limited melodrama doesn’t amuse you.

Death Note is one of the best anime's ever to have aired and it is correctly rated as one of the top -- anime's of all time. It is an anime that you simply should not miss. It sent me on a craze for it. Though I have watched it after all this time, I realize that I shouldn't have waited this long. The characters have been represented incredibly and the storyline is what I would call ""The Plot Of The Decade"". Don't miss watching this.

It's the present day, and suddenly dragons have been appearing in the skies!  These giant creatures are soon feared and killed on sight, as they become more numerous and destructive.  But a young student runs away with a dragon's egg, and raises the young dragon in an abandoned school.  But this cannot last forever, and she is discovered - but at the same moment, we learn that the dragons may not be the enemies that we once thought, as another apocalyptic threat emerges.     
And that's just the first half.  The second episode jumps hundreds of years into the future, to a different society where humans and dragons fight in cage matches.  But even as the times change, age-old threats still remain.     
This two-part story is nothing special, but it doesn't drag, either.  In fact, if anything, it jumps from point A to point G pretty quickly, and probably could have benefited from a longer running time to flesh a few things out.  The art is decent, the animation is a little bit weak in places.  Be aware there is a decent helping of gore.

I was surfing through google images and stumbled upon a picture of Munto. I Loved his design but I couldn't get any of my friends to identify him so after months of staring at his picture and looking for ANY tag that would help me id him, I finally found out about his anime. After reading a bit of the plot, I'd honesty have to say that I was more intersted in seeing this design in action than the actual story but I gave it a chance. From the pictures I saw, I saw promise but after seeing the anime, I was bored senseless.  
The plot, though somewhat interesting, wasn't as riveting as I hoped. You have two people from two dimensions parallel to each other and it's near imposible to cross over but the girl has to cross over to save the other dimension. These are the beginings of a good plot, so what happened? Well, the characters are as ineresting as mud, they take FOREVER to get to something exciting in the plot, and there's no music to help with the atmosphere of the scenes to make them more bareable.  
In one world, you have a group of unnamed bad guys destroying King Munto's kingdom in the sky (and their HOME) just BECAUSE THEY CAN (really, no real motive was EVER revealed, A holy crusade for the greater good would have been nice) and people sitting around and LETTING THEM while saying hope is not lost as long as we withhold our troups and have faith in Munto who has leaped into an area where him just being there is slowly and PAINFULLY killing him while he tries to convince this boring little middle school girl, who is the only one that can see beyond the barrier between them (and that's the only thing interesting about her, everyone else thinks she's a liar instead of crazy), to help him.  
In the other world you have the boring everyday life of said boring girl and her friends. She know Munto NEEDS her to help him and that COUNTLESS lives are at stake but even as he lays DYING in front of her, she still says ""you have the wrong girl, I don't know what you're talking about, leave me alone"" instead of HELPING him like a SENSIBLE person would if a person was dying in front of them. Also, it's a MIRACLE she has just been tagged as a liar and NO ONE has thought to AT LEAST get her couselling. Who wrote this, a -YO?! Hey, if she was at least considered mentally unstable by the general public, it would make her half of the story more interesting as she is strugling to find answers (is the floating kingdom real or do I really need STRONG medication?), but no, we get this half-a** piece of sh**.  
I was excited to see Munto but after watching the OVAs and finding out that they were just a portion of the story and the anime has the whole story, I gave up on it. Usually when anime's chop up episodes into OVAs or a few movies, the pull the highlights of the anime and if THAT was the highlight, I say it's not worth it. Thank GOD my dignity overwhelmed my curiosity to watch them because I don't know how much more of that I could take.

When it was initially released, Macross: Do You Remember Love? was a benchmark by which other anime films would be judged. Its beautiful, detailed animation holds up even today, over -- years later. This is in no small part due to the always gorgeous work of character designer Mikimoto Haruhiko, and now-legendary mechanical designer Kawamori Shoji. 
In comparison to the TV series, Do You Remember Love? solves a lot of the problems people have with it. The animation holds up much better. There are no shortcuts or sudden drops in quality due to budget constraints. In addition, the movie format cuts a lot of the slower parts of the story that put off some fans. The pace is much more consistent, and downtime is minimal. 
On the downside, the shorter format sends any development of minor characters out the window. Roy and Claudia's relationship, Max and Milia's relationship, all personality of Kanzaki, the bridge bunnies, and all of the Zentradi... these aspects are all greatly cut back if not gone altogether. This is a typical consequence of converting TV series to feature film format, so it's not something one can hold against Do You Remember Love. However, you will feel a better connection to these characters if you've seen the TV series first. 
The music utilizes many of Minmay's songs from the TV series, with the addition of the title track &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; The song itself becomes a major plot point, and at about - minutes in length plays over the whole climactic battle sequence. Iijima Mari was also propelled into pop stardom in her own right due to the mainstream popularity of the single. 
I definitely recommend Do You Remember Love? to anyone interested in the Macross franchise, as well as anyone interested in the best of --'s anime.

Wow, never in my life have I seen an anime as outstanding as Code Geass Hangyaku no Lelouch R-! I found myself not leaving my chair for anything whilst watching this. This is purely amazing. The characters are brilliant and unique. The story is a sequel to the first and it shows. I truly find it lives up to the first season. I found myself enjoying this season as much as the first. I went in with no hope, hearing from my friends ""It sucks"" and ""Worthless sequel"". They've missed out on a perfect anime. While many people compare this to Death Note, I don't because Death Note's ending was mediocre whereas this was perfect. --/--

The special episodes of Durarara!! did not contribute to the main plot whatsoever, but was able to portray the characters and their interactions in ways that were typical of them.  Since the specials weren't a part of the main storyline, it made sense that a few new side characters were introduced for the two episodes exclusively.  I also found there to be more light-hearted humor in the specials than in the anime.  Overall, the Durarara!! specials have the majority of the qualities that make the anime superb and I would suggest it to anyone who has watched the Durarara!! series.

This is the BEST drama/comedy/romance you could ever have. the story goes by so well. smoothly and nothing rushed. also everything gets explained even the cutscenes that we didnt see in the end. --/-- in everything. it was the perfect anime for me. I also loved how they expressed their feelings since most anime's usually beat around the bush but not this one! really great anime in every factor. There were a good mix of funny and sad moments and also plot twists that you would not expect. The character growth is really balanced and great as well. The only thing you have to get used to is the underwater living style. The ending was also absolutely great. This is a must watch anime and would recommend to everyone!!

As ---- comes to an end and we prepare ourselves to welcome in a new decade, I write this review as a testament to where I feel one of my favorite anime franchises of this decade now stands. 
Sword Art Online has always been a popular light novel and anime franchise that dominated the ----'s. However, despite its success and long-standing popularity, there's no denying that there's always been that certain vocal minority that always feels the need to criticize Sword Art Online on a --/- basis. Whether it be normal viewers who have or haven't watched the series or some anime reviewers that always feel the need to make their opinions feel like fact, Sword Art Online could never catch a break. 
Despite all this, there's a reason Sword Art Online has never faded into obscurity and oblivion and has always managed to stand strong as one of the defining anime franchises of the ----'s. And Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld is arguably the biggest season yet, encompassing how Sword Art Online has continued to grow not only as a successful franchise, but one that still retains legions of millions of fans that are growing to this day for what it has to offer. 
Story: --/-- 
For some people, they either say SAO in terms of story hits it out of the ball park or misses and gets a strike. But for this season, I believe SAO hit a home run. At the very least, I can argue it's been improving its swing and shows no signs of stopping. Comparing the first half of Alicization to its second half (aka War of Underworld in this context), I would say the second half not only builds upon what the first half introduced, but also manages to conceive an engaging and consistent story that goes above all other previous seasons. If one were to say the first half of Alicization faltered in its later episodes, I could only hope they stayed around for War of Underworld to see how actually great it is. When Alicization transitioned to War of Underworld, SAO essentially went from being the standard shonen fantasy adventure that Kirito embarks on to a story of tragedy that does not pull back on the deaths and grief war brings even in a virtual world.  
Basically, I would say War of Underworld's story is a vast improvement on SAO's storytelling. I would even go as far as to say it's like experiencing the story of a Fate series anime. The ufotable adaptations, mind you. Not a lot of people might say that, but I know I did.  
It also helps that War of Underworld has some of the best action in SAO yet, featuring tons of battles that keep the viewer invested while also giving development to much of the Integrity Knights and even some depth to the inhabitants of the Dark Territory.  
I will delve into the characters of War of Underworld later, but overall, the story of War of Underworld is perhaps the best of SAO yet. 
Art: --/-- 
No matter what you think about SAO, one cannot deny that SAO has always performed well visually. While the first half of Alicization was good in animation too, I have to admit the Blu-ray/DVD version of the first half of Alicization has better animation quality compared to the TV version. But come War of Underworld, I believe the animators won't have to do much editing for the Blu-ray/DVD version of War of Underworld. Because War of Underworld's art and animation is already great to begin with. And we're talking about the TV version! 
I always felt SAO had revolutionized its art and animation ever since Ordinal Scale, and War of Underworld manages to present nigh-flawless art and animation that leaves little to no room for error. From eye-astonishing fight scenes to the always gorgeous backgrounds, SAO always delivers on the art and animation while also improving on it as each installment releases. 
On a side note, the occasional CGI rendering of background characters fighting in the war may be off-putting to those used to traditional animation, but at this point, I don't mind it, because a lot of other anime use it too and the CGI here doesn't take away from the splendid art and animation of SAO. 
Sound: --/-- 
Yuki Kajiura is a composer legend and no one can tell me otherwise. While there's mostly some carryover of soundtracks from previous seasons including the first half of Alicization, there is still some new soundtracks to listen to that are just splendid for the ears to experience. 
But the biggest appeal in sound are the opening and ending songs. Haruka Tomatsu, the Japanese voice actress of Asuna, sings an opening song for SAO once again with Resolution, which not only is awesome to listen to on its own, but also fits the ambitious resolve the Human Empire has to protect their homeland from the Dark Territory and the latest antagonist yet.  
As for the ending song, just when it seemed LiSA was done for the year with Gurenge, the opening of Demon Slayer, LiSA sings her last SAO song of the ----'s with Unlasting. While Unlasting may not be enough to make me shed a tear like Shirushi from the Mother's Rosario arc did, Unlasting is absolutely heavenly to listen to, as its melancholic and somber tone suits the grief and despair that Alice Zuberg is going through now that she's in a scenario where the Kirito she fought with is out of commission and longs for him to fight alongside her again for the world he saved alongside her and Eugeo. 
Character: --/-- 
And now I shall talk about the characters. First things first, it's important to repeat that Kirito is in a coma. So for those who think he's still going to be an overpowered protagonist in War of Underworld, you thought wrong. While his consciousness still desires to protect those he loves, he is absolutely unable to move or fight, at most only being able to react to those close with him. It's just heartbreaking that no matter how one viewed Kirito, he's essentially been reduced to a vegetable on a wheelchair.  
That said, I've always felt the greatest aspect of Kirito's character was not what actions he took to help others, but how his actions inspired others close to him and allowed them to help back in his time of need. This is most exhibited in Alice Zuberg. With Eugeo tragically out of the picture and Kirito in a comatose status, Alice takes the spotlight as the main heroine of this season. In War of Underworld, I truly got to see the strength of Alice's resolve. How she wanted to protect the world that Kirito and Eugeo saved was presented well in the anime in my eyes. 
But other than Alice, the Human Empire and even the Dark Territory got plenty of character development too. Bercouli finally takes the stand as the highest authority in the Human Empire and absolutely shows why he's a force to be reckoned with. In addition, Fanatio manages to overcome her self-consciousness over her gender and finally embraces it while also proving she's a capable solider on the battlefield, male or female. Even Deusolbert gets some time to shine as a noble warrior going all out Archer of Inferno from Fate/Grand Order (except that he's on the good side) on the Dark Territory soldiers. However, the most notable of them all would have to be Eldrie, who made a most selfless and meaningful sacrifice that would forever set the tone for what was to come in War of Underworld. 
But what's even better than the Integrity Knights introduced from the first half of Alicization are the new ones introduced in War of Underworld: Renly and Scheta. When I was first introduced to Renly, I didn't really like him at first since he was a coward. Regardless, I held onto the hope that he would grow out of his cowardice and learn to overcome his fears. Not only did he manage to do so, but in just less than half of an episode, he gets a flashback that explains in full detail why he became fearful of his fighting abilities. To get that kind of treatment even though he was just introduced in this season is amazing. It's even more amazing how despite that, it still gave Renly a ton of character development that you wouldn't expect from one who was just introduced in the latest season. Scheta is no slouch in that department either, as not only does she get the flashback treatment, but her distinct stoic and aloof personality makes her stand out from all the other Integrity Knights and female characters. Not to mention her interactions with arguably one of the best Dark Territory characters: Iskahn, Champion of the Pugilists.  
The Dark Territory was already a setting filled with a diverse cast of people and armies. But what really makes the Dark Territory interesting is how the people there aren't all generic evil villains. Some, if not, all of them have a human side to them, proving that they're just as human as the Human Empire. In fact, two of the leading members of the Dark Knights weren't evil at all and only wanted peace with the Human Empire.  
Sure, the goblins don't have enough intelligence to have a truly human side to them, but the rest of them aren't fighting out of pure bloodlust or for the fun of it. They're doing it because they're being forced to and are helpless to defy their Emperor Vector. They wanted to invade the Human Empire, but come Emperor Vector, he twists that goal and forces them to die in vain just for his own personal gain. These events form the backbone for why one feels sorry for an anthropomorphic pig whose entire ogre army is being sacrificed for an attack that fails in vain, an anthropomorphic wolf that just wants his people to return to the abundant grasslands where they can live in peace and harmony again, and the leader of a tribe of pugilists who are being treated like puppets by the hands of Emperor Vector. Which is why Iskahn stands out so much as a Dark Territory character. 
Practically SAO's answer to Fire Force (and arguably Zuko and Azula packed into one feisty redhead), Iskahn is perhaps the most human of the Dark Territory inhabitants, wanting to fight honorably with Scheta and even questioning the authority of Emperor Vector. Seriously, I want more characters like Iskahn.  
As for the Glowgen Defense System, they're pretty decent. They may not be as interesting as Quinella, but they're miles better than Sugou. The banter between Critter and Vassago made for some of the most witty and amusing villain conversations I had ever seen in SAO. And me personally, while Gabriel Miller may not dethrone Quinella as my favorite SAO villain, I feel Gabriel Miller is essentially a better Sugou. Here, while he does sport the occasional creepy face, it's more tolerable in my eyes and his villain motives aren't defined by generic sexual pleasure or wanting to take over the world. To sum up, his philosophy can be defined as a consistent lust for soul-eating. One that goes all the way back to his childhood. For better or worse, it's clear Gabriel Miller is not messing around. He knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. 
I would go more into detail about Asuna and the other side characters, but I feel Asuna, Sinon, and Leafa will shine more in the second cour. As for the side characters, Lisbeth truly took the spotlight this cour. Klein, Agil, and Silica aside, Lisbeth made her mark in SAO history with her speech. In the midst of the War of the Underworld crisis and difficulty persuading her fellow ALO peers to come help in a time of need, Lisbeth demonstrated why she's just as important a character as the rest of the SAO cast, telling the players of ALO that the lives they live in the virtual world are just as real in the real world and that no matter what world they're in, all humans, real or digital, are undoubtedly real. 
For a side character to make a speech like that is powerful. You have my respect, Lisbeth. 
Enjoyment: --/-- 
It doesn't matter what any anime elitist or snobby YouTube anime reviewer tells me. I've stayed an SAO fan for as long as I can remember. Even though I don't read the light novels, for me, the anime has always been enjoyable. War of Underworld did not disappoint and managed to deliver on all fronts. I won't force anyone to submit to my opinions, but at the very least, I want to express my own opinions. Of all the SAO seasons so far, War of Underworld truly set the bar for what the story of SAO holds. If I could enjoy War of Underworld on all fronts, I wholeheartedly can't wait to see what the final cour holds in store. A-- Pictures, don't fail me now. 
Overall: --/-- 
Towards the end of this decade, I know most people wouldn't define SAO as their anime of the decade in the ----'s. While SAO may not enjoy the same unanimous critical acclaim as titles like Attack on Titan, One Punch Man, etc., I'm proud to stake my claim that SAO has managed to stand tall with them even among its polarized reception. 
From kickstarting Yoshitsugu Matsuoka's seiyuu career since his star-making role as Kirito to heavily influencing the anime industry to release more light novel anime adaptations and isekai anime like Re: Zero, Konosuba, etc., there's no denying Sword Art Online has always managed to remain an important part of anime in the ----'s no matter what one thinks of it. 
And for me personally, compared to other franchises like Tokyo Ghoul that are popular but haven't had as much fortune in succeeding this decade, I would say Sword Art Online truly made its mark on the ----'s and closed it off with a bang with arguably the best season to date.  
So Sword Art Online, through all your ups and downs, thank you for all the enjoyment you have brought to me this decade in the ----'s and I look forward to what the final cour of Alicization holds and what the future of the Sword Art Online franchise will be.

Just based on the premise, I had really low expectations for Akatsuki no Yona when I started it. But those expectations were greatly exceeded within a fairly short amount of time, especially after about episode - or -. It's not a particularly unique plot, but it definitely has its own identity and interesting characters, beautiful animation, and epic music. 
Yona rocks. I love her, because really the majority of the series focuses on her development and growth... and she grows beautifully. She starts out as an innocent princess with no knowledge of the outside world and a little bit of a spoiled attitude, but this series really changes her and develops her into a strong, dependable young woman. I cannot describe how much her character development pleased me. Other than her, my favorite character is actually Ik-Su, the priest. He may be a minor character, but he's just the sweetest, most hopeless case ever and I adore him. 
But I wasn't a huge fan of the dragons or Hak. I liked Shin-ah well enough but, otherwise... I guess I just felt a bit irritated because it seemed to me that they all (especially Hak) were conspiring to hold Yona back from finding her strength. I know that's the time period they live in, but it just made me grit my teeth. In a way, I saw Hak as more of an antagonist than Soo-won, who I actually thought was an interesting and complex character by the way. Just because I so badly wanted to see Yona succeed, I found myself glaring intensely at the majority of the characters who kept Yona's company when they would try too hard to shelter her from danger. 
But despite that, I really loved Akatsuki no Yona. An overall great story about resilience and empowerment and growth, with just a hint of romance sprinkled on the side. I'm also reading the manga, so I can't wait to find out what happens later in the story!

STORY 
-/-- 
Azumanga Daioh is a show about nothing, literally. Think of it like Seinfeld, but with high school girls and as much hilarity, and you've got all the bases covered. The episodes revolve around six girls and their daily life at a high school, which always ends up being random in some way.  
The comic formula is hilarious. Many scenes will make you scratch your head and wonder ""eh?"" while simultaneously laughing, while other scenes make you laugh by repeating the same thing over and over and over and over, far past the point where you think it should have just stopped the joke. The best comic relief was definitely the male teacher who was always hitting on the girls, who had a trademark jaw drop constantly. He would randomly be thrown into the episodes very spasticly, making anyone with a sense of humor laugh out loud.  So really, don't go into watching Azumanga thinking you'll get any sort of a plot. There are only a few episodes that are linked somehow, but the rest do follow a timeline (the girls making their way through three years of school, up to the satisfying conclusion).  
Art 
-/-- 
The animation is really simple and clean which fits the style of this anime, but I don't like this kind of look. There's nothing too impressive about it.  
Sound 
-/-- 
The music in this anime was alright sometimes bordering irritating, I wasn't too fond of the opening it just sounds irritating with the high pitched voices but I suppose it goes with the show. The background music started rubbing me the wrong way after a while.  
But from what I recall it's mostly silence since they have such long silences after a ""joke"" which I didn't find that funny. They would have these ridiculously long pauses after a joke and I'm just sitting there still bored to death and I'm like was that supposed to be funny? Is someone supposed to be rolling on the floor laughing from that?  
The seiyuus all did a good job portraying high school girls and especially Chiyo-chan. 
CHARACTERS 
-/--  
The character development was basically non-existant, yet I still gave this section a -. Why? To put it bluntly, Azumanga Daioh has some of the most hilarious characters I've seen, who all fill their incredibly exaggerated role perfectly. Chiyo is the little girl who is the epitome of cuteness. Her voice helps with this persona, as well as giant watery eyes when she gets upset, and her little girl ways of doing things. Sakaki is obsessed with cute things and is super quiet, and always blushes whenever she sees a cat or dog, yet (for the comedic effect) she always is bitten when she tries to pet things. Tomo is the most obnoxious character by far and is always yelling and pissing people off. Yumi is probably the least developed character -- her one quirk is that she is obsessed with her weight. Then there's Osaka, an extremely slow and stupid girl who tends to always make you laugh with the idiotic things that come out of her mouth. And finally, Kagura is athletic and competitive. These six characters are fairly extreme to begin with, but them morph into super extreme characters by the end of the series.  
The entire series is about pushing the limits of comedy, and the characters help out with this immensely.  
OVERALL 
- / --  
Azumanga is a great watch for any fans of comedy. Out of all the random series I've seen, Azumanga definitely has the highest concentration of randomness and laugh out loud moments, combined with hilarious characters and wacky moments alike. If you like comedy series, I can't see why you haven't watched this yet! And if you haven't, pick it up right now, since you'll surely like it.

Darker than Black was a fairly pleasant anime to watch. I've heard a lot of good comming from this anime, so I've decided to give a try. I wasn't overly surprised by it. It is an original concept and a fairly good idea behind, but they never dwell enough into it. We get this world where two mysterious gates appeared who knows why and who knows how. It is never explained. Not only that. It also changes some humans into contractors, giving them abilities beyond what a normal human being can do. There is a price to pay that differs from person to person. Again, it is not really explained why that is. 
Not that the idea of people with superpowers is wrong, but a good explanation is needed. The contractors are linked to the Gate and...? It stops there. As far as the payment goes, some are quite plain and some are just gruesome, like eating cigarettes or children. They do mention at some point that it could be link to a trauma the contractor went through when he was still ''human''. 
Story wise, there is a lot of plot points (I mention them above) that kept me from enjoying the show as much as I would have otherwise. The two-parters episodes felt really episodic. The storyline still got across, but not enough. 
Character wise, Hei was a breath of fresh air. With his two personalites, going back and forth between them, he was really well played. As for his team... Some of them had a background, others didn't. It would have been nice to know at least a little but more about Mao. You have this talking cat, and we know he has lost his original body, but how? It is never answered, or nothing that is related to him. Yin is still weird. We got her history, but how did she became a doll? Dolls are never explaned either. The backgrounds characted are nice but there is nothing much to talk about. 
The animation was good, between slower/faster scene. Some of the action scenes were a nice balance of fast-pace action and slow-mo, to let us fully see what is happening. Expected nothing less from Bones. The drawings were good, but not great. 
Overall, I enjoyed this serie. The story plotholes were a big thrownback.

I took a look at this show because it had an interesting premise and seemed to be getting good ratings.  Dragons trying to coexist with humans and do slice of life stuff.  I was looking to branch out a little and perhaps see if there was something fun going on with a show that a lot of people were talking about as it was airing.   
The show had started out fairly decent if a little silly, and I was curious what they were going to try to do with the characters that they were assembling.  After watching a few shows where the hero gets sucked into the fantasy world, having the fantasy world come to the ""real world"" seemed like it could be pretty fun to explore. 
Unfortunately, things didn't stay interesting for very long and I ended up very disappointed with this show to the point where I'm pretty exhausted with it after the conclusion. 
Before discussing what ultimately made me dislike the show, I will discuss the technicals.  The art was slightly below average here.  While characters were pretty colorful, there was always something a bit off with the animation and the lines that doesn't quite feel right.  It's not an incredibly well drawn show.  The sound and voice acting were average.  Nothing stood out to me as exceptional, but then, nothing was overly bad either.  My main issues were with the story and ultimately the choices made for the characters. 
What had the potential to be a character study of breaking out of routine and new ways of looking at things quite quickly devolved into lazy writing of repetitive jokes and fan service of questionable taste and appropriateness.  While there is nothing wrong with fan service, there is a point where it can't substitute for writing decent characters.   
The main characters are a salary woman and her dragon maid.  They have their quirks and their interaction looked to set the stage for an interesting slice of life, learning a new world dynamic.  I was actually pretty intrigued the first few episodes as they were interacting.   
I actually started liking the show less and less the more characters were being introduced.  While one would think that adding new dragons and friends around the neighborhood would add interesting interactions, all too often the writers took the cheap and easy way out of making characters very one dimensional and repeating the same jokes over and over and over again.   
One major issue comes with the younger dragon who comes to live with them.  What at first seemed like it would be interesting, as these dragons are very old compared to the humans, quickly turned into a relationship with one of her school mates where this dragon in a little girls body does something lewd and her school friend provides an inappropriate surrogate nose bleeding reaction to her.  This becomes a running gag in the show.   
Another issue comes when a different dragon appears and becomes a guardian of sorts for a little boy.  The running gag with these two is that the dragon is an incredibly buxom sexpot who has no issues at all being naked or shoving this little boy in her cleavage complete with bouncy noises while he acts horrified.  While this could be funny if it happened once as part of a ""cultural misunderstanding"", it essentially becomes their whole relationship schtick and the basic gag anytime they show up in the story.  It wasn't funny enough to carry the characters. 
I could go on about a few other characters but they are similar in that they are one trick gags that get rotated in every so often as the show goes along. 
With characters like this, the show's humor end up feeling very repetitive and one ends up feeling a bit creeped out after watching these things over and over.  Or not, depending on what you're in to, but that was my reaction.  The characters do engage in a variety of activities, but instead of writing new humor, you get the a twist on the same boob jokes or whatever the character joke is over and over in a new environment.   
The longer the show went on, the more I felt like I knew pretty much how each story was going to play out, and it really wasn't very funny or interesting anymore. 
There are better ways to do fish out of water shows like this.  This ultimately felt like a quickly produced cheap show to me, and in the end, a bit of an insult to my intelligence.  Granted, I didn't go in expecting a lot here, I was actually looking for a light entertainment show to balance out the deeper stuff I was watching, but still, this ended up being pretty repetitive and way too focused on bizarre attempts at fan service that just felt creepy. 
I can't really recommend this show when there are far better options available.  There are more interesting examples of shows where humans and other creatures get along, and there are better shows for fan service as well that actually have a more interesting story.  I would seek those out and only waste time here if you absolutely have to see what people are making memes about.

When asked whether or not I'm a KyoAni fan, I'd always say that I'm more or less indifferent towards them. They've got their works which I absolutely adore (Clannad, Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) and then there are those that I can't say I'm a big fan of (K-On! comes to mind). After enjoying Amagi Brilliant Park immensely, I came to Hyouka as their next work on my to-watch list. And ""color me"" extremely impressed. I don't think I'll have issues with calling myself a KyoAni fan anymore. 
Here's one thing Hyouka manages to do right off the bat - get me interested in the shenanigans of school-going kids and their curious adventures in the domain of unknown. Usually, it'd take a lot longer for me to get invested in these characters and their adventures, maybe --- episodes into the series or even more, but thanks to the extremely likable characters, things become a lot easier. The main character, a lazy slob with his motto in life being modeled around the law of conservation of energy, is a lead well done due to the fact that he's not exactly a cardboard cutout like a lot of protagonists these days seem to be. His actions, at least initially, are dictated by his energy conservation principle - he weighs in all the alternatives to settle on the one which requires least expenditure of energy. His development as a character is handled pretty well with the catalyst being none other than the female lead - Chitanda Eru, a cute but highly curious character. Her curiosity knows no bounds and she often ends up dragging Oreki, our protag, into matters that he'd rather stay away from. The mysteries that are dealt with in this show are often the product of our lovely Chitanda getting all curious about something that takes place in their everyday life and our gang that comprises of two more characters, who are nicely handled for the most part, going about finding a solution to the said mystery. Now, a ""mystery"" that is a product of curiosity regarding something that can happen in your normal everyday life doesn't exactly seem like an exciting prospect. At least, it didn't to me when I was thinking of getting into this series. But it'll suffice to say that they manage to pull it off somehow - making the mysteries sufficiently interesting so as to make the viewer curious enough to keep them watching -episode after episode. The show definitely does deserve credit for that.  
The story itself is like a loosely tied bunch of short arcs and standalone episodes. We're dealing with a KyoAni show, you know? But they're well done. The ""arcs"" got me invested and the standalone episodes had some good content. And each episode feels like it amounted to something so you don't come out of any episode feeling like you've just wasted the past twenty or so minutes of your life watching something that doesn't hold any weight. I'd advise against going into it expecting it to be a tightly strung story because it doesn't possess that. But the ""stories"" that it showcases, of our protagonists' lives, are well done and you'd probably have a nice time sitting through 'em.  
Extremely appealing to the eyes and extravagantly detailed backgrounds - they've long been KyoAni staples. And it is great to see they do not disappoint in Hyouka, either. Every single frame has been given careful attention and they look exquisitely beautiful. The last episode, or more specifically the closing sequence, was nothing short of stunning as far as visual presentation goes, for instance. Character animation, in particular, is extremely fluid and just fantastic all across the board. They do not disappoint as far as the OST or the music goes, either. Should suffice to say that the OST used is very fitting and compliments each scene very well. Would like to specifically mention the first OP - 'twas catchy as hell. 
Hyouka isn't groundbreaking. It isn't anything close to being a masterpiece. But it definitely isn't an experience I'd rather miss. A neatly done package with great animation, likable characters, stories that manage to stay intriguing throughout its run and a healthy dose of Chitanda's ""Watashi...kiminarimasu!"" make it a pretty good watch.  
Recommended watch.

Okay, so I was sick and stuff, coughing and what not and scrolling around crunchyroll, thus finding Kokoro Connect. I was like, huh... Looks kinda boring but let me try it. 
The first episode looked like the show was ganna end up like a boring slice of life show, seeing all the cute stuff like the opening sequence and the jokes; but boy was I wrong. 
I tried one more episode, and it looked like it gotten more serious.... By episode -, holy crap did it become heavy. Really heavy. Anime drama heavy, which is  what I like watching. Every character I liked a lot, expect for this ONE character (no spoilers review) but that was all opinion.  
Each episode was mad entertaining, it had humor in the right places and knows when to build up tension when drama shiet happens.  
The show goes for -- episodes, but then there is the finale ----- called Kokoro Connect: Michi Random (not on crunchyroll)     
The ending of the series is THEE BESTT and it ties ALMOST all loose ends. 
It ends well, it doesn't just end as if there should be a continuation. 
I love these type of anime genres, and this goes hand and hand with the other ones such as ToraDora, Anohana, or Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, etc. 
Overall, since the ending made me happy I was gonna give it a -/--, but now -.-/--

Masterpiece of chinese graphical production. Since I watched the opening, I was sure that this was not something made with low budget. It was great since the begging- characters, sound, graphic, story and became one of the best anime/donghua for me.  
Even though I am not much into this BL stuffs, this one made me to like it a lot. For those who still struggle or do not know- MDZS is BL in the whole context, but not the one you can be used to by watching traditional shonen ai. In the overall: 
Is it BL? Yes. 
Is it explicit and opened to heaven BL? Not much.  
This content is very subtle in the donghua (chinese term for animated version) and some of the watchers can overlook it or take it as a bromance thing, which I do not agree with. With a perfect storyline, amazing historical facts and action, it can be considered as  perfect shonen anime and one can totaly ignore that subtle signs of romance, which is described more likely a poem- not straight, not significant, mostly metaphorical- which does not mean that it is not there at all. Actually, romance is huge part of the story in the original novel and in the dongua version as well, but really easily to overlook.  
----------------------------SPOILER PART-------------------------------- 
MDZS started my danmei journey, which is term for chinese novels similar to BL/Yaoi genre. For those who loved MDZS donghua, I highly recomend to read original novel as a base for another types of productions.  
After reading the novel I was readly glad that I watched donghua at first, because if I rate dongua for -- points, then novel would have -- at least. Many things in donghua are not explained properly and to fully understand the point you must read the novel. In this case, if you don't like BL stuffs, then do not read it.  
The main protagonists, which I cannot chose who to like more, named Lan WangJi and WeiWuxian are like an ice and a fire. Two opposites with own personalities that you just cannot love.  
In the novel, they are officialy couple, officialy together, married, living together and with very active sexual life (also described in novel, to details). Through the whole novel we can see huge, slow and soft relationship development with the sighns of deep love (one of my favourite one is where Lan Wangji waited for Wei Wuxian to be ressurected for -- years, hoping to find him, playing Inquiry on his guquin to just find his soul).  
However, if you expect open BL romance in donghua, it would be quite dissapointed. Due to the chinese censorship, it is highly prohibited to show homosexual relationships on TV shows and this is the case. The relationship in donghua looks most like a bromance, however in the case of a characters that are already confirmed as pair and husbands, it's rather hard to present it like a bromance. Though I like to say, donghua is BL without romantic content because of censorship because everyone in fandom knows, that two main boys are totally into themselves. And because of this, it is really heartwarming to see every subtle signs of affection, because you just know that the smile of cold and repressed Lan Zhan to Wei Wuxian is somewhat intimate. But if you are more interested in romance, be sure to read novel or audio drama, you will be totally melted out, because the romance here is one of the most complex and beautiful ones that I've ever seen.  
The scenery in the donghua is on the other hand awesome, graphic is pretty good with CGI stuffs that just fits in. Art in the opening is something that maches the era when the plot is happening, with the awesome opening. If you are interested in some kind of romantic official song for donghua, be sure to type on YT name of the song: XianYun, WangXian official donghua song (WangXian, which is official name for pair shipping of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian and great official hint for all of the fans).  
I really loved the series, season - and season - as well. Both mean so much for me, but after I read novel, I totally fall for MDZS. Both because of the perfect and mature  fantasy storyline and for WangXian beautiful romance, even if it is subtle in donghua.

I'll keep this brief, mainly because theres is almost nothing to this anime/video to be said. It's a - minute music video with a slideshow of uncencored anime girls. The music is kinda victorian era (if that makes sense), or some ----s stuff. It was totally average. The music, the animation, everything. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, it is right in the middle. It isn't something that you will despise, more like you would easily forget that it ever existed. Keep in mind theres no story to it, just mindless nudity with some background music. So yeah, everything to it is average.

This movie is serviceable. The story is simple, straightforward, predictable, and inconsequential. It all takes place on a far off island that we’ll probably never see again in the series. Since there are zero real stakes involved, it makes it hard to feel invested in what’s going on. I suppose that is what is to be expected with Shounen anime movies, though. The opening scene has a young All Might apprehending a villain which was probably the most exciting part of the whole movie. If the rest of the story were just young All Might adventures, I think I might have enjoyed that more. 
The art doesn’t seem to stand out from the original anime up until about the last -- to -- minutes of the movie, where it seems like most of the budget went. The fight scenes are nothing unique and interesting, except for the final one, so you won’t see the characters doing anything different with their powers than you would see them do in the show. The students’ colorful hero outfits are traded in for boring formal attire for most of the movie, which is disappointing since it gives the whole movie a very gray and sanitized look. 
This was my first time watching these characters voiced by their English VAs, and I have to say, I’m impressed. Each character sounded completely natural and their voice actor fit their personality to a T. The music was fine, but not memorable. 
The two original characters introduced in this movie are essentially the poster boy and poster girl for quirkless heroes. As father-daughter-combo scientists, Melissa and Dave use their inventions to help the heroes save the day. On the one hand, their presence is appreciated since it adds a new layer to the world of MHA we haven’t seen before. How much respect can you gain as a quirkless person in this world? The answer is: quite a lot, it seems. On the other hand, their presence is a detriment because they can essentially invent anything that can solve any of the heroes’ problems. And in this movie, they actually do invent devices which would greatly help our main characters. But of course, such devices are not meant to last and will never be spoken of again. As characters themselves, I think I will forget about them soon, given their generic personalities and bland design. Melissa is your typical one-note optimist while Dave is only slightly interesting because of his friendship with All Might. The villain is also pretty forgettable, he’s your vanilla bad guy that’s barely worth mentioning. 
Overall, the movie was a fairly enjoyable ride that I think other fans of MHA will enjoy, since it technically delivers the stuff that MHA is known for - big heroic fights involving characters we love. That being said, I don’t think it comes close to matching the emotional heights that the original anime has reached. As a one-off filler movie, it’s impossible to do that. Still, I would have hoped to see something new. A young All Might was fun to watch, but beyond that there is not much to this movie, and I don’t think fans would miss much by not watching it.

Carole and Tuesday is definitely a unique anime. In collaboration with Netflix and American singers, Carole and Tuesday, despite being a Japanese Anime, consists of only English songs. They also feature LGBT and people of color, something that you would definitely not be seeing in a normal mainstream Anime. I think we all know that Japan is pretty xenophobic, so this indeed is something different. 
That being said, you don't get any points for being unique. Sorry, this show kind of flopped. I really do admire the fact that this Anime has well made songs. There's been a numerous amount of times where anime about singers have very terrible songs. While I do think that these songs featured in the anime aren't the best, they clearly are much better quality than you would expect for songs within an anime. That is, of course, also true when you factor in how there are so many songs being sung, probably around --+ songs. That's a damn lot, and they managed to make them not terrible. Also, if you know anything about the current state of the world, you know that people love adding ""cultural diversity"" to shows just for brownie points. Witcher - adapting a person of color when both the game and book describe Ciri as white just pisses me off. Carole and Tuesday, despite promoting diversity, actually does not piss me off at all. It was done in a more subtle way, less intrusive, and most importantly, it was an original series. They didn't just ""adapt"" a show with a white MC and make them black. Instead,  they started from scratch. This is an accomplishment. I do not mind this anime's attempt at diversity, as it is actually well executed. 
But. Why did I rate this a measly -? Well, the rest of the anime is just so terrible. The characters are actually not bad. Carole and Tuesday, Gus, Roddy, Angela, Tao, Ertegun, etc aren't that bad. They aren't archetypes or so tropey. That being said, the story featuring them just sucks man. Carole and Tuesday just become BEST friends within a minute of meeting each other. Gus, Roddy, and everyone joining with them just becomes the best of friends with little to no interaction. The story progression is just terrible. It's soulless. It's like a person going down a checklist of plot points to go over and that's that. It's like: ""Oh, there needs to be some sort of setback, just make one."" ""We ran out of interesting ideas, why don't they just find some amazing singer right on the street? Or get invited by this bigshot Celeb?"" ""Oh, we want to incorporate snares and other guitars into Carole and Tuesday's song, why not just pick some random people off the street?"" And of course, (SPOILER) you have Angela randomly falling in love, her mother dying to increase drama, and political undertones. Everything is so rushed, and the anime focuses on the stupidest things. Angela's arc could have been much more meaningful if there wasn't a chalkful of episodes of something along the lines of ""Tuesday falls in love tehe!"" Or, how about the only meaningful character arc in Carole is actually half an episode long? Or, how about when they dedicated --- episodes of a clearly forced conflict, because the writers for the show decided that they needed some sort of conflict, and resultant making up for the show to be complete. 
And, it's like the Carole and Tuesday are gods. The only ""failures"" they have, are ones that are out of their control, not because they weren't talented enough. Success is smooth sailing, which kind of takes away from the fact that they are amatuers. It's more like you're watching geniuses in the field already.  
They force politics, rivalries, and inclusion of many celebrities, while also having episode around stupid filler arcs that don't matter. And then, you think the theme of the anime is AI songs vs humans, but it doesn't ever end up like that. The AI thing just gets thrown away, and it doesn't even matter. Like what?? The weak sci-fi futuristic world building and the lackluster use of the theme of AI also does not make this anime better. In the end, the Scifi aspect of the anime is more of a gimmick than anything. And that's the problem. Everything is a gimmick, and nothing seems genuine. In the end, it's a mess, and a waste of time. It had no focus, and the anime didn't feel like a musical anime at all, in terms of writing, at least.  
Side Note: Like, why is it that Ertegun is the most developed character out there? He's, like the only character that has any sort of development. I feel like if he was the MC, the story would have not been white bread, but something actually worth watching. I honestly found his arcs to be much better than anyone else's, which shouldn't happen, really. His interactions with people are pretty damn funny and well made.  
And of course, like I just mentioned, Carole and Tuesday don't function much as a musical anime. There is no artistic struggles, band formation, or REAL strife among band members. Now, I am not going to say that these have to be in a musical anime, but having a perfect run towards the top (within a YEAR from literally nothing) is not a good show to watch, isn't it? Their first single hitting #-- on the top charts is ridiculous. I don't feel as invested in Carole and Tuesday as I should be, since the story progression is so boring. I don't feel anything as Carole and Tuesday release, yet again, a top hit. I don't feel anything about when Carole and Tuesday visit a top singer, since they visit one every other episode. The writers are lazy, there is no emotional investment to be had in the anime. The only thing propping this show up were the songs, really.  
Anyways, Peace.

There were two-romcom anime that were airing from the spring -- season. -D Kanojo Real Girl and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. However compare to Takagi San which was more a tease feast instead of a romcom both -D Kanojo Real Girl Kanojo and Wotaku love is hard for an okatu were actually romcom that uses the character, drama, comedy and narrative to the fullest. However only one of the two romcom anime from the spring -- season was good and that was Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. What Wotaku love is hard for an okatu has over -D Kanojo Real Girl is that one the characters were likable, two that show was well paced and three the romance was actually great and believable. As much I want to go into more detail of why Wotaku is a better romcom anime than -D Girl Kanojo stay tune for my review for Wotaku love is hard for an okatu. In that review I will go into more detail of why I love, Wotaku love is hard for an okatu while I hate this -D Girl Kanojo which speaking of -D Girl Kanojo is no contest not only one of the worst anime of ---- bit is also one of the worst romcoms I have ever seen period. 
So what went wrong with this show? 
Your soon gonna find out. 
Hello everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and welcome to my review of -D Kanojo Real Girl and with that said let’s begin 
Story. 
The story follows a generic okatu high school student named Hikaru Tsutsui who is shunned by his classmates for his otaku behavior. One day he gets set to do pool cleaning duty for being late along with a beautiful but reputed troublemaker Iroha Higurashi who is also considered an outsider by other students. At first reluctant to even talk to Iroha, Hikari is able to overcome his insecurity and defend her from bullies. In yet another pool-cleaning task, they decide to start a relationship. The catch? Iroha is due to change schools at the end of the year. 
The story is awful. 
Am not kidding this is one of the worst romance stories I have ever seen period. 
For starters this show does a horrendous job at portraying the okatu culture. Unlike Wotaku love is hard for an okatu where the show portrays the okatu culture in a more realistic way that is grounded and believable this show this show literally took all of that and throw it out the window in favor being comical and unrealistic. For example in one episode Mitsuya sees Hikaru helping his sister then Mitsuya tells his sister to scream in order for the police to catch him as well branding Hikaru as a lolicon for days. Okay I understand if you don’t like the person as the well the hobby that he does but you didn’t really have to out of your way to humiliate him in public like that so he can be a easy target for the police. 
People don’t behave like this and that event alone really shows how bad the character interactions are which I get to talk about now. 
Episode - alone is the worst first episode I have ever seen a romcom. Instead of having the two main characters slowly learning about each other the show decides to start off with a very contrived pool scene where they both of them fall into the pool. After that the show decided to have an awkward conversation by having our female lead Iroha ask Tsutsui that he is a virgin and Tsutsui replies honestly. The whole conversation feels forced and unnatural as both characters talk at each other instead of allowed a character they sentence plus nothing from that conversation was remotely interesting and because of these reasons alone the show did a horrendous job at establishing theses characters.  
To add insult to injury all of this shit happened in the first episode where both of these characters met for the first time. I would have been okay with this if that happened in later episodes where at that point the two main characters started to understand but having that scene happened in very first of the series really shows how poorly directed and written this series is. 
The single worst thing about the show is that the show itself at times literally forgets that it was a romcom anime as it the show at times devolves into a shitty slice of life anime with a poor portyal of otaku culture which completely kills all the potenal romcom thanks to its stiff character interactions and relationships. 
Overall the story in -D Kanojo Real Girl is awful. 
-/-- 
Characters. 
If you the story was bad enough guess what? The character are even worse. 
Tsutsui is just your boring and unlikable okatu freak who is hard to relate to thanks to his stiff character interactions. 
Iroha is just your typical easy going girl who jealous a lot. While I liked Iroha more than Tsutsui in terms of personality I still thought she was a pretty mediocre character at best. 
The rest of the cast are just throwaway romcom characters that we all seen before as they only to exist to create drama and conflict to the narrative. 
Overall the characters were just plan terrible. 
-/-- 
Visuals. 
Like with the story and characters the visuals are shit. 
The character designs for -D Kanojo Real Girl are very uninspired as they look like they were done in - hour without a second thought. 
The animation is below average it constaints of shotty camera angles, still frame and overall weak animation. 
-/-- 
Sound. 
-D Kanojo has very forgettable soundtrack overall. The same can apply to the shows opening theme however the ending theme was kinda decent. 
The voice acting in the show is pretty decent overall and all the Seiyuus did a fair job on each role. 
Overall the soundtrack is pretty mediocre at best. 
-/-- 
Final Thoughts. 
This show is a dumpster of a romcom anime that deserves to be burned and forgotten. The story is badly written to the absolute core, the character are all unlikable idiots, mixed with a forgettable ost, weak production values and poor story directing. If you want to watch a good romcom anime from go watch Wotaku love is hard for an okatu instead of this train-wreck. 
Final Score -/--

As a proponent of the previous season of SAO, this season sucked. Like, no offense, but it just let me down. It's not like all my opinions on this season are negative, but a lot of the texture the last season had just went away during this season.  
I still love the world that War of Underworld took place in. The possibilities that could be written in are endless, and it's still a massive breath of fresh air compared to the second season of SAO. Obviously, the art still slaps. The colors are gorgeous, the effects are mind-blowing, and the architecture still wows me. As far as the characters go, the set of characters that were already present were really strong, and there were a few fairly interesting ones that were introduced. There were a few of them that I thought were written well, though we didn't see much of them. 
But listen, y'all, the rest of this season just didn't do it for me. The story in the beginning few episodes and kind of at the end had me nearly as hooked as the previous season did. It took Alice's character and made her all the more intriguing. Once the war started, though, my interest waned heavily. The fight sequences were often brilliant when it came to animation and movement, but the story itself bored me. Whatever magic I found in the previous season just wasn't there this go-round. I'd attribute my lack of interest to the fact that watching it week-to-week just made it all seem stagnant. You'd get a fight involving one character one week, and the next week was the same exact thing but with someone else. And, frankly, the characters that got focus this season weren't developed well enough to warrant the attention they got.  
I don't mean to gripe because it wasn't all bad. At the very least, I think it's set up nicely for what's to come, and the story for the outside world always kept me interested. I guess I just expected last season to be a reset for SAO, and instead of getting better and better, it sort of just flat-lined. I know there's a lot of people that'll disagree, but it is what it is. I'll still watch SAO as long as it's around, though, because it has the potential to be outstanding.

Ghost Hunt, in a short sentence, is Scooby Doo for teenagers. A flawed but watchable show, I came away from Ghost Hunt glad that I watched it, thinking it was decent but not blown away by any stretch of the imagination. 
Art- 
The show itself looks fine- probably well above average for when it came out- and has a few standout moments. Some of the ghostly entities themselves- particularly an evil spirit rising up from a well in the second arc and a frail, blood-covered ghost emerging from the darkness in the seventh arc- were really well done and were memorable. There are also multiple scenes throughout the show in which a large number of spirits are all on the screen at once and those are typically visually appealing. Mai, the female lead, also has dream sequences relating to the current case throughout the show and those often have nice visuals as well. 
With all that said, both the opening and ending sequence are among the lamest, most boring and generic I've ever seen. With so much material and so many characters to work with it is unbelievable to me they couldn't find something better than, quite literally, a bunch of spheres changing colors. The opening sequence seriously reminds me of my desktop screensaver in which a random generic shape bounces across my screen, changes colors and then keeps doing it as it changes to a different color. I think they could have done a lot better. 
Sound- 
For the most part the voice acting was quite good, but I've got to call out the character of John Brown, who in the anime is from Australia. The fake Australian accent we get in the dub is god awful and not remotely believable. Half the time he sounds more Scottish than Australian. I can understand wanting to hire someone you know and trust- and they did indeed hire industry veteran Jason Liebrecht for the part- but he's literally from Texas and the fake Australian accent is rough to listen to. Hiring an actual Australian wasn't necessarily the play either, as it's entirely possible their accent would be too thick for Western audiences to properly understand at all times, but I think they could have done better than this. 
The soundtrack was good. I know ""good"" is a lame and generic word for something, but that's just what it was. It was better than ""okay"", never bad and it wasn't quite ""very good"" or ""great"". Good is the right word. In particular, the music during the scenes in which the characters confront the main baddie of the arc, which is almost always some kind of ghost/spirit/apparition as opposed to a human, stood out to me. That said, there wasn't any track I felt compelled to add to my playlist after the fact. The music did what it needed to do and was respectable and that's the long and short of it. 
Character/Story- 
This area is likely where I had the most complaints, but it's a mixed bag as opposed to all bad. Starting out with the positive, almost all the self-contained arcs were enjoyable little short stories in and of themselves, felt different from one another and had different kinds of resolutions. For the most part each character among the fairly large main cast actually mattered and contributed and it didn't feel at any point like it was a one man show or like any character was utterly useless. Everyone always did something, or multiple things, to help solve the problem. 
The thing is, the anime chose to focus so much on the individual case by case arc by arc situation that was occurring that nothing else ever developed beyond the absolute bare minimum. There simply is no overarching plot, period. There just isn't. At the end of the anime there really aren't any bigger picture longstanding questions to be answered because, well, those questions simply were not asked in the first place. Character relationships do not progress in a remotely believable way. By the end of the show the main cast has worked together for over a full year and yet their relationships have not progressed whatsoever. They all still talk to each other, know about each other and feel about each other exactly as they did in the first or second arc. It's to the point where you could watch the arcs, other than the first which sets everything up, in a completely random order and it would not change anything. 
There are countless small examples of this that individually are eye-rollers and not a big deal, but together, adding up over time, really begin to detract from the show. For example, nine months into working together main character Mai makes it clear in a conversation with Monk she has no idea how old he is. Not believable. Likewise, Mai has a crush on the male lead, Naru, pretty much from the start though she constantly notes he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. How does she feel a year later? She has a crush on him and thinks he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. Her crush has not grown nor faded. She's not gotten over it and moved on with time nor has she fallen even more in love. It's simply exactly the same as it was a year ago with zero progression or development for better or worse. Again, not believable.  
The arcs as a whole do not feel connected. We're largely watching a number of self-contained short stories- each having its own mystery- and that's the whole show. 
Addressing the arcs themselves, I have a more positive than negative opinion of them to be sure, but they were not without flaws. Many of them are extremely predictable, with the most egregious offender being the third arc in which they hint extremely strongly who the villain is by the second episode and then drag it out for two more episodes only to confirm yes, the one we made it clear as day is the bad guy is in fact the bad guy, much to the surprise of all the characters. 
As an in general the arcs that were four episodes felt a touch too long and could have been wrapped up in three episodes. Two would have been too few but a lot of the time with four there was too much talking both at the beginning and the end with overly drawn out explanations. Three would have been the sweet spot. Mysteriously, there was one single episode in a show that was otherwise filled with multiple episode long arcs, that was completely self contained that began and solved its mystery all within one episode. That episode in particular felt completely unnecessary and super rushed and was a low point of the show. That episode simply did not need to exist and it added absolutely nothing to the show as a whole. 
And, finally, there are a plethora of conveniences and too many instances of characters being outright stupid. A main character says in a conversation SHE FORGOT SHE WAS PSYCHIC. Come on man... Is that remotely believable? Likewise, in one of the mysteries a child character who is unable to speak is playing a game of hide and seek and he chooses to hide on a rooftop when bad weather hits and the adults can not find him. Zero explanation is given as to how he got up there in the first place, but there's visibly a ladder leading up to where he is so we can assume he climbed it to get up there. Fine. Why then could he not use that exact same ladder to get down? Likewise, with adults directly below him calling for him and looking for him, even though he cannot speak could he not do ANYTHING- push the ladder down, throw his shoe down at them, smack his shoe against the side of the building to make noise- ANYTHING- to get their attention? He doesn't, and instead the character literally dies up there and is never found. Because, you know, even after the fact no one would think to climb the ladder and check. There were too many times where characters were that level of stupid for the sake of the plot needing them to be. A lot of events shown in this anime would not be possible if characters with common sense were involved. 
Enjoyment- 
This anime can be enjoyable if you come into it with the right expectations. I came in blind and this anime didn't have a couple things I expected it to have- namely an overarching plot whatsoever and moments that were actually scary- so I was a bit underwhelmed. The show doesn't even have jump scares and I can't imagine any adult would be truly frightened by anything shown here. It approaches atmospherically creepy once in a while but that's as far as it will ever go. There isn't anything that happens in this show that will leave you sleeping with one eye open. Basically, to enjoy this show you need to come into it with the understanding you'll be watching eight different self-contained short stories that happen to revolve around the same group of characters solving the case, much like Scooby Doo and the gang, but nothing more. 
Overall- 
Ghost Hunt is one of those shows in which the viewer must have the right expectations in order to enjoy. If you're someone who needs depth and character development you'll find more frustration than enjoyment here, as it simply does not have those things. However, if you can enjoy self-contained short stories and just take things for what they are with no expectation of anything grander Ghost Hunt might be worth a watch. The stories themselves are fairly interesting, the characters are likable and it's not a dark or nightmare-inducing show --% of the time. A decent watch for the horror or mythology anime fan but nowhere near an all time hidden gem. 
+Large cast of likable characters that all contribute 
+Eight different mysteries that feel unique from one another and are interesting to watch 
+Solid voice acting, minus John Brown 
-Non-developed, non-progressing interpersonal relationships 
-Plethora of conveniences/characters being dumb for the sake of the plot 
-Frequently predictable 
OBJECTIVE RATING- Strong - Weak - 
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- -.-

Instead of -/--, think of this review as - out of - stars. I say this because this anime leaves one with a 'glass half full' perspective despite knowing that it's not brilliant. 
Admittedly the first episode is pretty terrible, rife with all of the show's major flaws packed into -- minutes including some dodgy animation, crappy dub (which is only marginally better than the bog-standard original Jap audio), a forgettable soundtrack, and some ridiculous cliches (the matrix-style 'come here' gesture will make you cringe). However if you can survive that, you will see what the series can truly offer behind its 'badass action' exterior; a strangely involving mobster drama. 
After the initial setup, showing an undead gunman take on the ghoulish 'org-men', we launch into a lengthy flashback that, most of the rest of the series, builds back up to that point. And despite the cliches, the so-so dubbing, the arguable animation, and so on, I ended up quite attached to these characters. We see their struggle to the top over time and how each of them truly believes in their cause. Even the bad guys, for the most part, are relatable in some way, which of course pulls the viewer in for the climactic finale that pits the two best friends against one another. 
At times the even the way the story is told is pretty well done, constantly switching up the narrative between past and present to show how deep the bond is between the cast and how actions from decades ago can carry on a ripple effect. 
It's a deeply flawed series but for one that has such an unimaginative core concept at its heart, I was surprised to find how much Gungrave made me care about what was going to happen to the cast, and how it constantly kept me guessing with just who was going to survive the chaos by the end of it all. 
It's an anime that can be a slog to begin with but by the time the arguably silly fantasy content returns toward the end of the series, you may well find yourself far more invested and even hooked until the end. I'd say give it a go and you may well enjoy the ride, even if it doesn't particularly stay with you for very long.

Nothing about this feels like it should have been an anime. In fact it may have been better as live action considering the animation is minimal, color pallet is drab, and character design pretty generic. I understand not every anime has to be about heroes and destiny, mechs and magic, aliens and demons, time travel and parallel dimensions... BUT they should be a little more interesting than some completely average high school character (with seemingly nothing going on) besides not knowing what to do with his life (so then like every high school character ever). In a show where characters appearing ""normal"" seems to be the unique twist instead of appearing super eccentric, kawaii, or ""anime-y"", no one feels particularly relate-able or interesting or funny. Like the forgot to infuse the characters with well... ""character"". I found myself bored and un-charmed all the way through desperately waiting for something, anything to happen but it never came. If it sounds like I don't enjoy slice of life, high school comedy/romance shows you're dead wrong. Shows like Orange get what this show feels like it wish it could do. Where other high school shows with a twist like Angel Beats I feel does a disservice to the show.

Ive posted this review for the last - weeks updating it as each episode came out. Now that this can officially stay up here this will be my finalized review of Fire Force with the -th episode. The next time I will update this will be when the anime finishes (If I don't drop it by then). 
-Doofenheimer. 
New era anime really took a dive in almost everything except animation. Can't recall any anime from -----Present that would be a front runner in a Top -- anime list. The only anime from ---- to current day that has the ability to be on that list is Mob Psycho, My Hero Academia and Your Name (Maybe Erased). The best anime from these past years have been sequels (or prequels) to pre ---- anime and that is embarrassing. Fire Force has added to this train of bad anime that couldn't live up to the hype. All action and no backbone. Fire Force is an anime I recall as ""meat head action anime"". The two front runners of this season of anime are Fire Force and Dr. Stone. Both so far are disappointing but Fire Force has only gotten worse. Dr. Stone has already laid down the hardware of what the anime's end goal is. Fire Force is still confused on what direction they want to take. I understand there has only been - episodes so I'll give it time but as for the current -, this is a major flop. 
Story: - 
From what they have given us so far the story is cool but has a lot of generic elements. Fire fighters fighting humans that burst into flames. There are multiple squadrons and of course some of them are more sinister than the others. It seems the -th squadron is the most kept out in terms of knowledge of the Infernals (What are the odds) and want to discover the secrets the other squadrons are keeping such from them. Cool concept, awful delivery so far. (Episode - update) Now they are using such cliche ways to keep people motivated and watching. They pull out the psychological card which just makes me cringe on how hard they are trying to pull together the story. Spoiler, it doesn't work. It's misplaced and just fails. The story is losing its originality and becoming more of a cliche shounen. 
Art: - 
Best part about Fire Force is the animation and art. I will admit it is impressive but that is to be expected because of technology advancements. The more years go by the better animation should get and this is an example of good animation. the art is colorful at times and the setting is unique. I will be expected just as good animation in the following episodes. 
Sound: - 
Sound and Art go hand in hand when it comes to making an anime and the sound doesn't disappoint either. Nothing to complain about. 
Characters: - 
Cliche fan service girl that probably had a dark past and pretends to be all nice and friendly to hide their grief? Check. Cliche always serious badass (Can't forget the tinted glasses)? Check. Cliche meat head jock? Check. Cliche happy go lucky mc that runs into a fight without a plan? Check. Cliche childhood rival only used to make the mc irritated? Check. Cliche cutesy priestess? Check. Don't even get me started on the cliche, ""My mom died and i'm here to avenge her death"" back story of the mc. The anime jumped straight into the first mission without giving hardly any information on the team. All they gave was names and in the first - minutes of the first god damn episode their already on a mission... Slow down and let us settle in on the setting and get some character development. Many of you would argue of course that the lack of episodes explains this. And to that I say... Isn't that what the first few episodes are suppose to be about? The first few episodes introduce the characters and give background info and lets the watcher settle in on the surroundings and characters THEN you can jump into the missions. They just now introduced the evil -th squadron and if I didn't think the characters were bad, I f*%^ing hate these guys. Cliche villains with a smart mouth but no back bone. Typical ally/enemy type deal. By this point I could care less if the entire squad got wiped out. I wouldn't even bat and eyelash. Sorry about going on a tangent but this was my biggest gripe of this anime.  
Enjoyment: - 
Theres no drive to what they do. They just throw in characters and just force us to accept their there and move on with it. Shinra and the captain are the only characters that have a motive to fight. And they JUST now implement the reason for the priestess becoming a fire fighter? The others are just there cause why not. Can't enjoy a fight or emotional talk if there is no emotion at all. Like I said, ""meat head action"". And if any of the characters do have a motive they should have explained so earlier in the anime. Should not be explaining why the character is there -+ episodes into the anime. That is bad delivery. Another annoying concept they do is the quick jump between scenes. They want to create the illusion that the anime is fast paced and action packed but just leaves the audience confused on why and what the characters are doing. They jump from scene to scene and that does A) take away emotion from each respected scene and B) Makes everyone forget or confused on whats going on and for some reason people think this is a way to get people on the edge the whole time. Confusing and rushed, bleh. I can't believe people are actually saying this anime will take over and be the best new gen anime. That is mind boggling people actually say that with a straight face. 
Overall: - 
Nothing needs to be said that hasn't already been. Very mediocre anime that failed to the hype. Lets hope they make a miracle of a comeback cause i'm ready to drop it.

Anime studio powerhouse Madhouse is back with a boxing anime. Standing at -- episodes plus a sequel movies and a few others that followed, the studio went with an extremely popular manga series by going with an unknown director, Satoshi Nishimura (Trigun). Being a sports anime with heavy influence from the ---- hit Ashita no Joe, the wonder of if this anime would hold up visually and/or follow the shounen route of repeated fight sequences. 
Hajime no Ippo or Fighting Spirit in its Western release, focuses around the timid and shy Makunouchi Ippo. He is bullied in High School and passes up spending time with his students outside of school to help his Mom (single parent) run their fishing business to make ends meet. Needless to say, one day Ippo is ganged up on by a group of bullies and takes a heavy beating. It just so happens a middleweight boxer saves him, and takes him back to the training gym. Ippo awakes and is asked to punch one of the bags, thus showing his hidden punching talent from helping out in the fishing business. Ippo strives to become stronger, and thus begins the story of Ippo’s rise in the boxing profession. 
It is a powerful story, and unlike in Ashita no Joe, all of the characters from Ippo to his rivals and romantic love interest all have an interesting back story. The anime gets the viewer to care about the events taking place and the people taking part in it. This anime focuses heavily on character development and does this extremely well to say the least. From what is learned in the boxing ring between opponents, and the fact Ippo develops a habit of running into his opponents pre-match gets Ippo himself to learn about their backstory, and even sympathize with them. Due to Ippo’s character, he is never over-confident, he stays humble and timid, and always strives to train and become the best. This is unlike most shounen series where the main characters gets beat down and then gets back up to channel some unknown “anime-magic” to win. 
Madhouse did something remarkable in creating a -- episode series where the animation was consistent throughout the entire run. This ranged from the smoothness of character movement, the punches always felts they had weight behind them even during training, to the way the boxers moved while in the ring. An unreal amount of research had to have taken place to get that right. Even the music and sound effects hit all the right notes with the fights and the viewer always creating an “edge of your seat” environment to really get that blood pumping. 
Ippo is a shounen anime, so the pacing can crawl at times. The same routine can be seen in the generic story formula, i.e. Ippo trains, backstory, Ippo fights, fallout, repeat. Ippo as a character isn’t overly appealing as much as his rivals are, and while the start is strong, the rest of the anime very much sticks to said formula. Not to say this isn’t exciting and captivating, but some might find it boring at times. Hajime no Ippo is miles above what other sports anime have brought such as Ashita no Joe. If sports anime is among a genre favourite, then there is no doubt Hajime no Ippo is a pure winner.

What an incredible show. The final --- episodes are just brilliant. 
It's a prison break story with kids. And to my surprise it worked freaking great. Maybe it's because all the prisoners in the story are likeable? Usually in stories like this there's an unlikable character or two that I hope dies, but I was rooting for everyone here to survive! Anyway, don't expect much in terms of action for most of the season. It's really slow going as they spend the entire season planning and preparing for their escape. Despite that, it worked because of the suspense of their plan being foiled every episode and because they're not really prisoners but livestock, so there's urgency for them to escape. 
Visuals are pretty great. Initially I hated their faces. They're too cutesy or derpy, but the art eventually won over. The voice acting was fantastic. The music was great as well. The opening and two ending themes are great too. Hope both artists return to produce themes for season -. 
I highly recommend the show. It lives up to the hype it was getting before its premiere.

PLOT: -/-- 
Started out promising, with an unique idea of capitalist super heroes competing for ""hero-points"" in a reality tv-show, their suits plastered with commercial ads. In the reality tv-show, good deeds yield points to the heroes (saving a human life +---p, catching a bad guy +---p, etc.). Brilliant start! 
But! This original idea of capitalist heroes was not explored in any depth, which left me super disappointed. The story doesn't touch the subject of capitalism or commercial ads or anything like that. It's just silly super powers and silly villains one after the other. None of the characters question the scoring of saving human lives, and not even the viewer is offered any food for thought on the subject. The only hints of critique are made of two characters in the show who are compulsive about the ratings of the hero tv-show, but even their compulsions are so shallow that they offer no surface for further analysis of deranged capitalist mentality. 
All in all, the whole anime misses it's greatest premise. A waste of time, beyond the first episode which demonstrates the concept. 
Other than for the plot, I have no complaints. Everything else was pretty avarage. 
... 
ART was ok with heavy use of above avarage -D. 
SOUND was ok with some semi-memorable themes. 
CHARACTERS were simple, but likeable nevertheless. 
ENJOYMENT was avarage... I mean, if you got nothing else to do, then might as well watch this. 
OVERALL... I hate myself for enjoying something so brainless. Oh well, many others drink beer on their weekends to dull their senses and to momentarily forget their existential angst... I watch average anime. Like, whatever.

I'm a fan of anime with action, but Spice and Wolf was honestly one of the best shows I've seen. 
Most medieval fantasy stories usually focus on fighting and magic, but Spice and Wolf focuses on trading and economics. It's a new original idea and nice transition to the knights, mages, and dragons we're all used to associating with the genre. Although the idea of a show with just talking and economics in a fantasy world may seem lame and slow, I never found myself feeling bored during the series. Spice and Wolf makes this tiresome and boring topic quite interesting. There actually is a little bit of action in the series, but it's very short and not too frequent. 
The focus on Lawrence and Holo throughout the series lets their characters develop well. It's not a very complex plot so it's centered a lot on them and their relationship. I found Holo's character very likable and she is no doubt one of my top favorite female characters.  
The beautiful vibrant scenery in the show was just spectacular. There was so much detail in the background and watching it in perfect HD made it look even more wonderful. All of the character designs and places really fit the setting to me. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary in this era.  
The soundtrack for the show was very simple, but it went along with the moods of the scenes perfectly. I must say I loved the openings for the two seasons. They seemed peaceful and fit the show very well. The ending song to the first season, although it was in Engrish, was pretty cute and I liked it. 
Overall I absolutely loved this show and underestimated it before I watched it. I don't expect everyone to love it, but if you think you might like it or want to try something new I'd definitely recommend this show.

If you played any of the corpse party games and found this anime thinking it would be good, i recommend either staying away or starting with very low expectations.  
If you are a true horror or gore lover and are looking for a short anime to watch in between other then this is perfect for you.  
I played corpse party myself and i have to say i was disappointing by the amount of important features  from the games that they simply skipped over. If a true adaptation was made it could easily fill twelve episodes so to find out it was only four i was skeptical before watching.  
The game focuses heavily on character development and mystery, not just horror or gore. This this anime skips over.  
I know i speak of the game a lot but I am a BIG fan of the games and i have to say this was very disappointing. The new story line gave it a new feel which i did appreciate   as it wasn't like playing the game again. 
Although i have to compliment the art style, it is not the best out there but it is definitely refreshing  and truly amazing.  
Overall i have to rate this only a five out of ten simply because I enjoyed this anime for it's plot line and the art work. I am glad something this bad was only four episodes as I don't think i could watch it if it was any longer.

I know I'm a bit late in seeing this anime, since it's been out for - years now. But I think that it is truly timeless. It's story line was breathtakingly beautiful and for me, is a worthy comparison to Clannad, the all time feels jerker of romance slice of life anime, though of course they feature different plots. I loved every part of it, and I was only able to because Sawako the female protagonist is the most sincere and humble character I have ever witnessed. She may not be as capable as others, but she tries. She tries so hard that you can feel sympathy for her every time, but nonetheless, even if you don't, I think you will end up rooting for her till the very end. It might be a romance anime, but it explores many different types of love one can feel: familial, friendship, self love and romantic love. 
Story: --/-- One day, I found myself seeking a romance anime that would touch my heart and make me feel some type of way. And after finishing this anime, I have no regrets! I'm so glad this was the anime I settled on because from the first episode, it had my tears rolling. I usually don't cry for anime, but this one hit something in me. The entire plot plays out in such a delicate manner, where all the feels come genuinely from each character's personality type and their innocent interactions with others. This anime is kind of dragged out to -- episodes, and I was hesitant at first if it would even be necessary to watch all --. But after I finished this, I went straight into the second season because I just could not stop. It was addictive for me, and I would definitely watch it again. It's rated PG---, but concepts are very simplistic and other than one or two episodes where they use a bit of offensive language, I think this anime is fairly innocent. However, perhaps the concepts of love and reasoning may be difficult for those under -- to understand. 
Characters: --/-- I think that a huge reason why this anime was able to speak to me was because of how well each character was able to convey their emotions, their thoughts and feelings. Now I do not mean that they are ---% on every aspect, but I think it was definitely above average. The core reason why I would rate this --/-- for the characters is because of their ability to grow. There are anime with female leads who fail to do the simplest of tasks, but then there's Sawako, a girl who truly finds it hard to understand things most of us would see as normal, but because of her humility, and her honesty, the viewer is almost able to sympathize with the reasoning behind her actions. Every time she accomplishes even the smallest of acknowledgement, one just can't help but be happy for her. She is a main character that may not always be capable but she is definitely one I could never hate because she displays qualities of the purest of heart. The male lead, Shouta, is someone who one can identify as the most popular boy in school, one sought after by a bunch of girls, one who is athletic as well as smart. Sure he sounds typical at first, but he is so much more than that. He is not full of himself, there are things he cannot do, feelings he doesn't know how to express. He is kind but he is not kind just to be kind, and he is able to see others for who they truly are. They developed his character to be able to display qualities of what it's like to be human. Instead of simply leaving him as ""the perfect person"", they were able to incorporate the concept that he makes mistakes too, and that's what is most lovely about it. The idea that characters are able to be who they are, imperfect, but still they receive love, and compassion. The idea that the main girl may not be the most beautiful girl in school, nor is she popular. The idea that people can be loved for their personality, even if they are not a perfect person is what is refreshing. And the way all this love is conveyed through a very ""clean"" story lacking in all things ecchi is what amazes me the most and I am happy that this is one of the few anime out there that doesn't need sexual components to have viewers. The other characters are just as lovely in their own right, and do share some background story to them as well, although not as much. But all the characters stick to who they are and have a firm ground on the person they see themselves as versus what they are really like, giving their character depth. 
Art: -/-- This anime's art style is not bad, and must have been good for when it first was released. However, I am watching this in ---- where graphics have been pretty stellar. Regardless however, the art style did not bug me that much. Everything was proportional because they chose to keep the art and backgrounds rather simple. If the viewer does decide to watch the second season, I'd say the art improves but not dramatically.  
Sound: -/-- It is what it is, and their voice actors suffice. I like the main guy's voice but other that that nothing bad stands out but there's nothing that was amazing either. The opening and closing are pleasant to hear but they do not stick in my mind very much. The second season has a better opening and closing, but that is just my opinion.  
Enjoyment: -/-- I loved it. Definitely worth pulling an all nighter for. I'm someone who does not like skipping episodes because I want every single detail but I can imagine that someone might not be interested in watching all -- episodes. There's a lot of parts that build up into something that pushes character growth but once finishing you might feel like wow all this was only to get this far. To each their own, but this anime was very pleasant for me. Maybe it did not hit home as hard as Clannad and Toradora did, but it is definitely one to remember for a very long time.

A girl and her extraordinary bond with wild beasts. An ancient secret hidden away by a mysterious clan that comes and goes with the mists. A growing conflict between the two great ruling regions of the land.  
Together, these narrative threads form the intricate web that is Kemono no Souja Erin, a coming-of-age story that slowly unfolds against the backdrop of political tension. Through the course of -- episodes, these story lines gradually intertwine and eventually come together to deliver a somewhat clumsy but mostly satisfying conclusion. 
Kemono no Souja Erin is undoubtedly a slow-paced anime. It takes its time to set everything up, and some viewers may find this unappealing. But for those who love to absorb themselves in fantasy settings, this show will not disappoint. The amount of detail that is meticulously crafted into the history and culture of the land is captivating. And because the relationship between man and animal is such a core element of the show, even the behavior of the beast-lords and their interactions with the main character Erin is explored quite extensively.  
Because Kemono no Souja Erin retains its leisurely rhythm throughout, this gives the show enough time to build upon its greatest strength: Erin herself. 
I can honestly say that Erin is one of the most well-developed characters I've seen in a storytelling medium, anime or otherwise. We smile with her and cry with her as she grows from a child — curious and endearing — to a young adult burdened with years of experience. From the get-go, we see that Erin is a bright and studious young girl, taking the opportunity to learn all that she can from her mentors. Each stage of her life is detailed in a humble and straightforward fashion. Her actions, decisions, and even morals are a direct result of the hardships that she has endured during the course of the story. Even as she grows and develops, one key characteristic of Erin remains consistent: her resolve. To be blunt, Erin is obstinate, almost to the point of stubbornness. She chooses to remain steadfast in her beliefs, even though she is quite aware of the consequences of the path she is leading. Don't be fooled by the negative connotation of these words though; they are exactly why Erin is such a human character. 
The other characters in the series are rather hit or miss. Some of them turn out to be bland and stereotypical, such as the main antagonist; others are not really explored fully, such as the Mist People. Furthermore, the comic relief duo of Nukku and Mokku may be appealing to children but will likely be irritating to more mature viewers. Several characters, however, play key roles in Erin's development and are interesting individuals in their own right, such as Ia-lu. But perhaps the most important characters in the show besides Erin are the beast-lords with which Erin bonds. Their attachment to Erin is very believable; it is touching and tragic at times, but never idealistic. Beast-lords are wild creatures after all, and they rightfully remain as such during the course of the series.  
My main gripes with the show may sound picky, but unfortunately they were severe enough to affect my enjoyment of the show. Recycled scenes and flashbacks are prevalent in the show; one scene in particular is replayed so often that it becomes grating, even though the purpose of repeating it is understandable — for reinforcement. Still, I believe that the show would have benefited from cutting down on the excessive use of such scenes. I also noticed that the same few insert songs were used in almost every episode, and many of them are inappropriately placed. The emotional impact of these songs would be greater if they had been used properly and more sparingly. And as mentioned earlier, the ending (particularly the very last episode) was messy and could have used more closure, especially since it was a ---episode series. 
I feel like these flaws were the unfortunate result of the show trying to be family-friendly — an interesting dilemma indeed, considering that most of the story is presented with a level of sophistication that no child could hope to appreciate. 
The art in Kemono no Souja Erin is simple, unique, and has a very appropriate children's-book feel to it. The OST is pretty varied and ranges from soft piano tracks and ambient pieces to Oriental-sounding melodies and even electric guitar tracks. They add a nice touch to the show's atmosphere for the most part. The OP and ED in particular are of great significance; they are heartwarming at first, but both are replaced about halfway through to fit the change in tone of the series. 
If you can manage to ignore its flaws, Kemono no Souja Erin will shine for you — if you give it the time to do so, that is. For those of you who desire continuous plot development, a fast-paced narrative, or loud action scenes, this anime is not for you. It is an anime for those of you who simply desire a warm and well-told fantasy tale with a solid main character and a truly fascinating world.

A huge disappointment! 
I have been a Naruto fan for ages and I have to say a HUGE Naruto fan. But there is one thing I cannot accept...when the author turns everything you like about the show to dust. 
This movie is set somewhere after the last manga chapter (By the way, didn't like the ending either.). Naruto is like a star in Konoha. Everybody loves him, he has a lot of fans, especially among young girls. This part was beautiful, I have to admit. I really enjoyed the feels when watching Naruto and his “Will of Fire” after all the suffering he had to go through. It was also nice to see all the other characters, especially Kakashi as a hokage looks so epic! And the intro where they summarized the whole story in an awesome ink-like animation was so amazing! 
Unfortunately, that's all. The rest of the film is not worth watching. You know, something is probably wrong when scenes that are supposed to be sad or dramatic makes you laugh. I found the whole plot really ridiculous and stupid. It had such a filler-like atmosphere. Some random villain comes here to marry Hinata and the Moon falls on the Earth to destroy it. Seriously? 
Plus most of the film is just about Hinata dealing with her love for Naruto and everybody forcing Naruto to understand what love is, to make her happy. Is Naruto soap opera or what? I don't mind romance in anime but this romance was so ridiculous and kinda forced or how to say that. I am not sure what to think about the intentions of the author. It was like “Umm now let's add a cool fight with...eh who? Well let's make someone random up aaand now...hm let's bring romance again, never mind just place there Hinata and her shy face, that's enough.” 
So the result? If it wasn't Naruto I would probably say it was an interesting movie, not memorable but not bad. The thing is that it is Naruto after all. It was supposed to be the last movie that closes one era in Naruto universe. It brought us a filler with a childish plot and distorted characters form the original anime instead. 
I expected more, much more dattebayo!

Inuyasha is the biggest dissapointment for me, I'v seen u gave him big ratings and I wonder why...really.*spoiler alert* If u havent seen the anime yet dont read.  
When I started watching I was expecting a classic fairytale with good vs evil, romance and good always wins, stuff that now is avoided today, everyone trying to be original. So the reasons my ratings are so low: 
Story:  The main reason everyone is chasing after Noraku is revenge and personal interests not for some good cause, revenge for Kikyo, revenge for Miroku's father and wind tunnel curse, revenge for family(Sango, Shippo), Kagome initially seeks to repair the mistake she made destroying the shard, etc. There are some boring episodes that have no connection with main story or the relations between characters.  
The MAIN reason i disliked the story was the ending, a much better ending would be if Sesshomaru used his sword to bring Kagura back to live(so in the end everyone is ok) and if the final choice(or ""the right choice"") was made by Inuyasha because in the whole anime he is the one undecided between choosing to be a full demon or a human. 
Characters: Characters in this story have many flaws, they dont have much depth and complexity, Inuyasha even as half-demon is much more stronger than the other demons...so why become full-demon then? Most of the time they are indecided, and wandering around looking for Naraku, they rely on Inuyasha's sword to much. 
Art: --% of the faces are a semicircles with a point as a nose and small ears, the only difference is the hair, clothing and size. There is a huge lack or facial expresions, only the eyes change sometimes. 
Exept the strong, main demons the rest of the demons are the same, forming massive demon groups that die instant and verry easy, have no blood, no limbs, as if they are made from dirt or wet sand(like sand castles @%@ ). The costumes are interesting enough and the colors are clear and well made. 
Sounds: The opening and end music is good, but sound efects are verry verry bad, also I watched english dubbed and the voices...big fail. 
Maybe i was to critical beacuse i was expecting better, also i'v heard manga is better. This was my -st review (a bit rushed, i could write more but would be to boring with details) so I would like your opinions, I'm verry critical and I dont give high ratings because is something is popular and I don't really enjoy giving notes like ""- out of --"", opinions are better. Sorry for any english mistakes. Have fun.

Another Dragon Ball film. Another retelling. This one combines the first and second tournament arc with the Red Ribbon arc. Then it tells it completely differently. For the curious only. 
Animation seems a bit sloppy here and there. Certain facial expressions used by our beloved characters don't really match them. Bulma is just all over the place. Everything else just seems like a step down from the anime. It works, but you'll notice it as well. The English voice actors are different from the anime. A few remain the same, but big ones like Goku are wrong. They will annoy you. Goku's voice just lacks conviction. But the music is all fitting. So at least we have that. 
The story is out of control. It starts with Roshi finishing the training of Goku and Krillin. From there they head to the tournament. But Chiaotzu and Tien are around. For some reason Chiaotzu is a ruler of an empire. It's weird. Tien and Chaiotzu are nothing like their anime counterparts. Then throw in some Red Ribbon Army. A hefty dose of Master Shen. Then you have the show. It's sounds like a mess, but if you look at it as it's own thing it works. 
Do you need to watch this? No. Do I even recommend it? Not really. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball and are curious then go for it. It's not going to make your experience that much better or worse.

Forget the plot.  Disregard the characters.  And abstain from having a central theme.  Just find a way to have the f—king fairies fight each other! 
Normally, machismo-laden, mindless fights are a surefire way to draw in a large audience.  Especially nowadays in the age of instant gratification and infinitesimal attention-spans.  But you can only treat the viewer like a brainless imbecile for so long, before they rebel and give you the collective middle finger. 
“Fairy Gone’s” plot is reminiscent of a ball of yarn.  It’s a jumbled mess of string (plot ‘threads’) going in every which direction.  Yet instead of clarifying the various loose ends, it continually adds more string to muddle the waters even further.  To mitigate this failing, P.A. Works — the studio behind “Fairy Gone” — attempts to suffocate the viewer with unbridled, senseless action.  The combatants for these battles (i.e. the fairies) are -D abominations.  It’s a crude, pale aesthetic that lacks artistic detail to bring the work alive. 
Marlya and Veronica, the two central characters in “Fairy Gone,” have flatlined on account of improper characterization; thus, inhibiting the viewer’s willingness to become emotionally invested in their cryptic past.  A past that seems to be the impetus for events to come.  The other characters are rudimentary with no one displaying a personality beyond some hackneyed quirks.  They are, if nothing else, the personification of classic tropes 
Lastly, the enjoyment is meager.  The battle choreography is sloppy and the pacing is rushed.  The OST is undistinguished and it is unclear as to how P.A. Works will homogenize this rubbish, or whether it will opt to double down on force feeding the viewer with unavailing action ad nauseam.  If you are looking for a show with a post-war narrative backdrop, special powers galore, and better character developments — then watch “Full Metal Alchemist” instead of this diarrhea.

This synopsis gave me same feeling as Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and that is the only reason i started watching this. I was not wrong. 
Story: Nothing is explained, you are completely lost,no plot, nothing just girls doing random stuff thinking its cute, AND IT ISN'T DAMN DANIEL. 
Art: I will probably get epilepsy till the end of this show. It feels like they didn't even try to make it look nice, it was like fu*k it, lets just make some bad art cause we know from this synopsys its gonna be retarded.So we can maybe go intro history defeating Yoshiteru Satoru masterpieces. 
Characters: Now this is what makes this show bad, i don't even know what to say to these characters, probably writter didn't know himself what to do so he just randomly put girls that eat whole day and do stupid things. 
Sound: This is only thing that is good in this show and i meant good compared to other aspects of this anime. 
Enjoyment: This is torture, not a single thing of enjoyment, i keep watching this show only cause im not the type that drop shows, just a few. 
Overall: Honestly i feel bad for the writter that will get roasted cause of this show, combined with all that was in this show it got its max with overall -

This is the best anime I watched so far, and probably that I'm going to. 
Not that I'm going to die anytime soon or something, but the past is obliterating. Especially the past and the characters, though I think it's not presented in the way it deserves. 
Let me clear some points: 
The story is not SHALLOW: Not at all, not even -%. You might think so if you watching the anime on a hurry just to put a check mark, but if you pay the slightest attention, you'd fall deep into the story. A little bit is presented about the characters, or even ---- years ago and the anime provided no hints about it. Personally I think the anime tells just a brief bit of the story and is going terribly fast without explaining the motives sometimes, this makes me think hard about the story and what might the characters be experiencing, especially those who lived ----+ years, and it's frustrating, but deeeeeeep. 
Each character has a really meaningful story behind them, that is almost entirely shadowed, and they don't seem to tell the story from their expression, which is kinda absurd but deeep, what makes them do that ? 
Powers are O.K., I actually like the system, but they don't serve a major part of the story. I like the fact that each clan has something special, and how humans attainted significant powers, like godess clan level by making weapons. It's not free, Arthur sword took thousands of years to forge and is actually unique to humans. If you come from a hardcore fighting anime background like DBZ or only watch naruto fights, you might not like the anime right away. 
THERE IS NO FAN-SERVICE, the only instance of this is Meliodas, which is the protagonist, X Elizabeth. And this itself has a story behind it in the manga, as Elizabeth is the .... doing let me spoil. We've actually seen him reject doing that to other ladies. Actually the whole sexuality shit is absent in the anime which is kinda cool. But, we've seen many characters yearning for their deceased loved ones. 
This is the anime to watch.

Just a few words about my disappointement. Minor spoilers ahead. 
The show's main character Ainz Ooal Gown degrades from a dark but somehow respectable person that saves Gazef, gives Enri an artifact to protect her village and avenges his teammates by killing Clementine, to an immoral psychotic madman that brutally slays, tortures and sends to a horrifull experiments hundreds of thousands of people. During those henocides, he hardly shows any signs of remorse, while his subordinates laugh and joke about what is happening. 
Not only this is abominable — this is also pathetic, knowing that behind the image of almighty ""Ainz-sama"" hides nothing more than a trembling nerd that achieved nothing in his own world — a being lower than any of the people he slain trying to become the ""Overlord"". 
This action, around which revolves the main storyline, is plain appalling. And hence, the whole anime deserves nothing else. 
Last time I checked, I wanted to relax by watching a bit silly, but nonetheless entertaining fantasy series; not an anime version of Black Sun ---. 
But well, I guess some of japanese people just still have it in them.

Overall: 
From the simple comedy that was season - to the plot focused season -, Working!! has oddly a good metaphor of growing up. Reminds me of those carefree days no so long ago. Yet it remains it's lighthearted charm. 
The show has come a long way from when it started, and not in a bad way. There is considerably more plot in season -, a slice of life anime where things actually happen. Unlike season - which teased you with development and didn't go anywhere, this season has real development. The amount of laughs and gags for the sake of it has gone down, but this is a good thing as repeating the same old gags would have gotten old. 
If you enjoyed the series or the genre, this season is probably the high point with every episode being memorable and enjoyable. However, season - is definitely not something one can jump into (like season - was) without watching the previous seasons. Enjoyment of the anime would be much lower, so if your new to the series, go watch season -! 
As for the ending, this series is one of the few anime to pull off a satisfying and sweet ending (you have to watch the Movie/Episode --)

I think the only thing I didn't like about Princess Tutu was the name of the show. With a story that, while original, hails to the great storytellers such as Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, set at a pace that presents itself willingly to ballet, and refusing to pull punches, Junichi Sato's dark fantasy about a duck who wanted to be a girl, and the prince whose heart she wished to piece back together is a fairy tale that children can enjoy and adults can adore. 
Like all good fairy tales, the story is most crucial. It must be whimsical yet cautionary, quickly paced, and tightly-knit. Tutu follows this formula well, though not so much the &quot;quickly paced&quot; bit. This is because Tutu has an episodic monster-of-the-week nature that can become an irritance, and would have been if every episode didn't, in some way, tie directly back to the main story. Much like director Junichi Sato's other hidden gem Kaleido Star, the story is broken into two distinct parts, which while seperate, are directly connected. This storytelling works best in that it provides two distinct and memorable climaxes while never feeling rushed or out-of-place. 
The main story itself is flawless. A fantastic tribute to the forgotten and oft-dismissed power of fairy tales and ballet, whimsical enough to never forget its true nature, and dark enough to invest interest and revoke the idea of it just being a children's show. 
It's characters range from the absurd to the sinister and some even manage to play both during the course of the series. The characters alone are uniquely crafted. Though some follow certain Junichi Sato molds, such as Fakir and Mythos, Ahiru stands out as a subversion of the cheerful, determined heroine his works are often known for in that her efforts do not always deem satisfaction, and her ultimate goal is not met with her ideal ending. Everyone interacts sincere to their motives and personalities and no one ever feels like they're doing something they shouldn't be. 
Of course the art, provided by Sato's mainstay HAL Film Maker is divine. Every scene is fluid and graceful, especially the dance numbers. Character designs and backgrounds are very imaginative and hold the Germanic fairy tale motif that the series sets for itself. 
The accompaniment for the series is a numerous array of classical music and ballet numbers, most of which will be recognizable by ear even if you can't remember the name of what you're hearing. Moreso, the music provides a direct parallel to the conflict in each scene it is used, and often scenes are choreographed around the music, making for dramatic impact mostly unparalleled. 
Yes, the title is a turn-off, and I'm sure many of you out there think ballet is for --year-old girls, but Tutu takes the most universal and respected elements of the things children love and craft something everyone can and most likely will enjoy. Though it trudges in a few places, Tutu never forgets where it's going. It's magical waltz always catches up and makes sure it ends on the best note it can. 
Overall, I give Princess Tutu a - out of --.

Honestly, I NEVER give reviews like this ever; I am normally open-minded of an anime and can always see the positive. The last one I hated this badly was Maburaho and that was a long time ago, so you can tell I am very open-minded of most anime as I say I am. But, unlike that, this one gave me NOTHING to work with and I'm sorry if you are a fan of this anime going through reviews, thinking all of them will be peachy-keen. But, this one won't be and, sadly, I can not find a single thing good about it. And here is why. 
WARNING: The entirety of this review is mainly one big spoiler, so read at your own risk. Almost entirely similar to the last one, except it has no moments that any casual newcomer can read. 
Right off the bat, this website NOW puts this anime into Comedy. But, it is NOT at all; for the most part. And, it's delivery of comedy was really stale in comparison to the first. But, let me get segregate this review into two sections. Firstly, the characters. Oh man, I wanted this to be saved for last, but I can not hold it off, as it does effect those who watched the first season. And, know the word ""cliché""? Get used to it for now. 
Remember Junichi, that guy with the hazel hair? That guy that had the soft personality, was really funny and had a generally different atmosphere from most male protagonists? Well, say goodbye to that, because he was retooled to match the hair color of his comedic friend, Suginami, and was given a cliché male protagonist personality where he can literally not explain a misunderstanding like his life depends on it, is constantly smacked around and only is respected in the serious moments. However, he had his moments in this one, but they were far from often like his hazel haired counterpart. He was also given a light facelift that ruined the soft nature of his look that he had before. Despite all this, he had the funniest parts in the anime, for the very little comedy it had; and his character didn't dilute nearly as much as the next one I'm about to bring up. 
This time, not Sakura; oh no. We are talking about NEMU. Now, this cuts right into my next section altogether, due to how much I hate this girl. Nemu single-handedly hogged Junichi for herself through the entire anime...and no, I don't mean they just hungout a lot. 
If you remembered from my last review, she is Junichi's ""sister"" which means she grew up with him and, well, hogged him. I am not going to lie, I hate this more than most hate (...) because, well (...), they didn't meet until much later in their lives. So, they did not have the bond that normal siblings have. Don't really want to list the anime name or any references to it, due to its controversial nature. It does unfortunately make my review look a big lop-sided here, but it is just too significant to bring up. 
However, to regress back to the prior topic, Junichi and Nemu pretty much WERE siblings, even if they weren't by blood. I know they said that cheesy line where they were ""hiding their love by being siblings"" but, can't any pair of siblings say that? No, they were siblings; I don't care how they phrase it. Sibling love is still too different from normal love. It is true that sibling love is actually one step away from normal love, given it is all of the benefits (in a good relationship) without the sex. So, just stepping up one more pretty much qualifies as lovers. 
However, Nemu's ill behavior towards Junichi really stirred some anger in my heart and reminded me they felt like siblings trying to have a family of their own. If you couldn't tell already, this season gave us THREE new female leads to, once again, fall in love with Junichi; seemingly out of nowhere as it seems, and pretty much turned it into a generic harem. But, tried to balance it with at least one new male, though he is significantly less important than Suginami in the end. He is definitely filler at best, since he has no altercations to the story; of which, Suginami hogs that spotlight himself in a few major points. Speaking of, I like how his character is nearly untouched from his season one counterpart. 
Anyway, to further bag on Nemu, you can tell both her and Junichi have a sibling relationship. I know in some anime the lovers have a hate period, but Nemu hates him the ENTIRE time. Their kind moments are only in the serious ones, but Nemu effectively treats him badly for the most part. Take into consideration how any other girl would do the same, for now I will list Kotori as she seemed to be the most competitive to Junichi's affection, and Nemu is not hot stuff anymore. 
In my opinion, that OVA was the TRUE ending to this anime. Kotori deserved to be with Junichi and it shows. She treats him nicely, is not a total bitch to him like Nemu and is more deserving of his love. Nemu is the kind of nice person that assumes her nice deeds should always be re-payed. And, well that isn't necessarily bad, if you think someone has to pay you for EVERY nice deed you do for them, then that is just you being selfish and not nice at all. 
But, to not put all this pressure on Nemu, I will say this much about Junichi himself. He is a lazy slob, had to have the help of his friends to get to school on time EVERY day and forgets things a lot. However, he is a very innocent male lead that, if given less pressure to explain things, does so very well. And, well, he usually never lies about it. He has been shown to be much more perverted in this anime, to add yet another cliché to the mix; but they only did the one time for some comedy with Aisia. I would dedicate a portion here to Aisia herself, but I don't want to write about this anime for long. 
But, I should probably bring up Sakura, shouldn't I? Well, the reason I didn't is because, well, the anime does something similar. She doesn't show up until the anime is almost over and her significance to the story is to just add another wizard to the mix to give Aisia some guilt about her magic. But, she is left unchanged, which plays a MAJOR role in the story if you are a very in-depth listener. 
I'm just going to come clean and say it, though. I will dedicate just a LITTLE bit of this review to Aisia, but only towards her main goal. Halfway through the anime, she notices that Kotori liked Junichi, but was baffled that Nemu had him all to herself; similar to me. So, she wished as hard as she could to the withered cherry tree that Junichi and Nemu would remain in a sibling relationship. In the end, this was the ending I wanted and so I was cheering Aisia on the ENTIRE time and was happy that this anime might have a good ending. Sakura tried to stop her, but failed (and I was just living it up right there) miserably. 
Why? Well, you remember how Sakura was not a grown women? Tick, tick, tick, DING! That's right, the magic in that cherry tree is STILL there because Sakura is not a grown women as she should have became after the tree withered; hinting it still had a breadth of life left within. She even references this herself to Junichi because she thought ""he would like her better that way"" or something, which means that she never let go of it entirely herself. I picked up on it right away, which horrified me because the story did get to me in a way. I didn't think I would have caught onto a reference that wasn't even brought up until one of the last episodes. In fact, I don't think it was ever brought up, hinting that you really just had to be listening to the anime to know for sure. I did, and was right, as the tree was saved. 
To summarize everything, though, I have no good merits for this anime as it was Cliché City the ENTIRE time. The guy ends up with the main girl, whom is the bitchiest of all the girls; the plan of the opposing protagonist failed and so forth. I can only recommend this to first time anime viewers, as you wouldn't catch onto its nature. But, if you are an anime veteran and have been watching many for years, this one won't be good at all. It also forces down a lot of ""sad"" moments at you that don't do it justice as well as the first season did. 
Well I already said this review would be all spoilers, there is one in particular that I do not wish to reveal for season one fans that want to finish up the anime. So, I will mask it with a warning, as I enjoyed it a lot; one of the few things I actually DID like about the anime. 
(SPOILER BEGIN) 
If I had to pick the one thing I enjoyed most about this anime, Misaki was it. It was the perfect reference to season one and only those that watched it will know who this girl is right away. I loved it so much because this girl was so subtle in her dialogue, but she was so discrete with who she was that it was hard for me to pick up the pieces. But, when I did, I realized she had the SAME last name as Yoriko. 
So, yes, Misaki is the girl that Yoriko explored the world for. You know, that girl in the window from the VERY first episode of Da Capo. It was truly heartwarming to see her again, and that she remembered everything about Junichi. I never knew why she didn't greet him again, but perhaps it might have been because that would require, you know, GOOD writing to achieve. I wish she did, but it was very nice to see her again either way. It warmed my heart. 
(SPOILER END) 
So, I would stay away from this one at all costs. It's not even worth it to watch this season, as it will end the way you expect it to. You know, where Junichi and Nemu get MARRIED. Oh, and apparently, a little baby boy grew up to be a little girl. I never understood that at all, but it made me laugh. One of the few moments of this anime that was funny WASN'T during an intended comedy scene, how quaint.

Grisaia no Meikyuu is a complicated arc from the main story of the Visual novel/anime (Grisaia no Kajitsu) the story is told by the main protagonist himself Kazami, Yuuji. Wanting to pursue a promotion within the CIRS company Yuuji must submit documents as part of the promotion process explaining his own past. 
The story telling of his childhood was so enticing, listening to him tell his story while watching the flashbacks and memories was perfect. Yuuji goes in depth on how difficult and traumatic his childhood was like. He explains his childhood thoroughly from an early elementary student to a young teen boy. 
A main protagonist with a tragic background is nothing out of the ordinary its quite common and over used within the Harem genre. Some do it better than other, but I believe the producers of Grisaia did it the best, its not one of those simplistic revenge story were the main protagonists sets out for revenge over the lost of a loved one. In Grisaia they actually go in huge depth of his past adding traumatic, sad , horrific, and psychological all into one you have pretty much the worst case scenarios all packed into one - one hour episode (--.-- approx). 
The art quality (expecting you've watched the prequel) is quite similar with the exception its a little more vivid and HD then previously. You have the strong vivid colors fitted with the smooth backgrounds giving a clear display of what you're watching.  Very well drawn characters and fluent animation with how little action scenes there were they were pretty intense and the blood splats were amazing and detailed.  
Sound quality was pretty standard nothing out of the ordinary. You have your same VA cast as from the prequel. There was not much background music since it was told in story telling POV, but the small sound effects put into for example flashing cameras, helicopter propellers, and punches were good. As for intro and outro as for where I watched it there was none they used up all the time. 
Ah the characters, Im sure many people in the anime community can relate and all agree dense male characters can be the most annoying thing in the world. Luckily there are the few main protagonists out there who just keep me sane one of them is Kazami, Yuuji this isn't your average male harem lead he is a complete --- to most of them he's competent, reliable, badass, handsome, and isn't as dense. His personality is pretty unique from my knowledge if he could relate to any character it would be Shiba, Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. As for all the other characters they all have around only five minutes of screen times, with the exception of Yuuji family. 
Most Harem anime are usually just full of just comedy and romance which is exceptional, but this is why I really enjoy Grisaia no Kajitsu its has all your standard comedy and romance elements, but has a darker undertone  mixed with a big psychological aspect it goes to great lengths explaining every characters background and  how they came to be, instead of your average harem with random girls just popping in and out. If you want a drama, romance, psychological, and comedy undertone harem I would highly recommend watching the prequel to this special.

Shogo Mikadono had been living a comfortable, carefree life up until high school.  As the only child of the Mikadono group, a wealthy network of the Mikadono family and it’s friends and business partners, he’s been selected as the sole heir to the company and family name that his father, Kumagoro Mikadono, has dedicated his life to strengthening and expanding.  Unfortunately, on the day of his ageing father’s death, when Shogo is finally given a taste of what’s written in the family patriarch’s will, it’s revealed that in order for the young heir to inherit his father’s very lucrative estate, he must undergo one final task;  To enroll at a certain high school, fall in love with a dignified and agreeable classmate, and make her his fiancee, with whom he’ll be sharing untold riches on the day of their marital vows!  It might not be the most romantic grounds for a proposal that anyone’s ever heard of...  Still beats the idea of having to come together to repopulate the earth, when you get right down to it...  But for a rich man to marry an attractive woman who’s only interested in business and money isn’t a new concept, and it certainly isn’t unheard of. 
However, as is the unfortunate pattern of life, even the simplest plans must become complicated somewhere down the line.  Not long after hearing about this stipulation, he’s confronted from just out of reach by a soft, reassuring voice that he won’t always be alone...  That the owner of the voice is his long lost sister, who has every intention of marrying him and staying by his side forever.  Wait, did I say soft and reassuring?  Because I meant deeply concerning, as it turns out that his father did in fact father an illegitimate daughter who’s been separated from him since birth, and to make this revelation even more shocking is the fact that the girl with the voice is also going to his new school!  Now, his attempts to pluck a bridal rose from a garden full of crazy weeds is being hampered by the fear that one of his sultry suitors may actually be his secret sister!  This matrimonial minefield is made even harder to cross by the fact that with each step that moves him forward, he’s being confronted by red herrings that are only pretending to be his sister for their own ends.  Can Shogo safely pick the woman of his dreams and collect his rightful inheritance, or is the only thing he’s bound to inherit a deformed child and a one way ticket to Alabama? 
You know, the longer I do these reviews, the more likely I am to cross every single animation studio off of my list at some point.  This time around, we’re talking about Studio Gokumi, a company that spun off from Gonzo in the early ----’s.  The name literally means Studio Group -, which...  I don’t know.  I have no idea what that does, or even COULD mean on a larger scale.  In any case, they haven’t done very much work, although I have seen two of their shows before, namely A Channel and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, two shows whose best qualities were their visual qualities.  A Channel, like most of Gokumi’s early work, was low budget, but managed in such a way that it’s lack of funds could never hurt it in any noticeable way.  Yuki Yuna, like most of Gokumi’s later work, was gorgeously animated with a lavish budget that the producers took full, appreciative advantage of.  Between the two, Nakaimo is closer to A Channel, being one of the studio’s earliest projects, and it looks way better than it really needed to look, given the nature of the material.   
True to form, Nakaimo looks perfectly fine.  The visuals aren’t mind-blowing of world-challenging, but they’re more than serviceable enough to be above complaint.  The animators were very clearly working with a tight budget, so the movement on screen is never exactly fluid, but the characters still move just as much as they need to to convey a sense of life.  There are shortcuts taken, which is kind of inevitable in such a situation, as movement occasionally has to be limited to save some money, but it’s never prominent enough to bother even the most astute viewer.  Not to mention, these shortcuts pay off with interest when the show DOES want to dazzle us with more impressive shots, such as one of the main characters swimming in beautifully animated water, or when they need to show us random CG effects like a can flying at someone’s head from off screen.  I’ve said before that given the choice, I’d prefer a well-managed low budget over a lackadaisical high budget at least seven times out of ten, and Nakaimo easily delivers on what I wanted to see from it. 
The artwork is also very pretty, with it’s only real flaw being certain shots where the background has an unnatural sort of heavenly shine to it.  It doesn’t happen often, thankfully, but it’s irritating when it does.  The backgrounds are fairly well drawn, and while most man-made backgrounds to have a surprising level of intricacy in their design and range of details, things like grass, trees and bushes do blur a bit when you look at them closely.  The characters themselves are drawn to type, milking the most cliched archetypes of the ecchi genre dry, extending all the way to the teacher being a little girl.  You’ve got the cosplaying loli, the pigtailed flat-chested tsundere, the overdressed goth-loli sweetheart girl, and of course Itsuke from Haruhi as the protagonist.  It’s saving grace is that once you get past the clichés, the characters are still designed and drawn really well, although the constant blushing can get extremely annoying.  The lighting and filtering effects are also utilized well, if not very often. 
The soundtrack is a bit on the generic side, but it’s not bad by any means.  It’s very pretty in it’s orchestration, but it’s also really repetitive, as any given track just loops around every few seconds or so.  It does it’s job well enough, and you’ll hardly notice it, unless it’s doing the one thing about it that impressed me...  Instead of playing off the little sister mystery as sexy or romantic, moments dealing with the mystery...  AKA phone calls allegedly from the sister and certain off-color remarks tying into it...  Are paired with music that actually manages to make the concept feel creepy or ominous, which is how it damn well should feel, so props for that.  The opening theme, Choose Me Darling by StylipS, is your typical fast, catchy song from multiple harmonized female singers, but what makes it awesome is the percussion underneath it, which creates a pretty memorable beat.  That, and i’m pretty sure a decent amount of the animation budget went into it, as it makes for a pretty awesome watch, and it goes out of it’s way to introduce the characters and several plot points that happen throughout the show. 
The English dub was produced by Sentai Filmworks, and before I start doling out the praise...  Of which I have plenty to go around...  I’m going to have to go into some negatives, because Nakaimo’s dubbers made two huge mistakes.  First of all, I was shocked to see that Steven Foster wasn’t on this dub.  Yeah, he quit a while ago, but I’ve only ever seen lip-synching this bad under his direction.  In his heyday, his response to the critics blasting him for his translation choices was to release dubs where he stayed true to the original Japanese right down to the letter, and stopped giving a fuck about lip flaps.  These were his *better* dubs, so I’m kind of assuming the company figured out from him that they can do this to save some time and effort and still remain on peoples’ good sides.  This purely speculative explanation, whether true or untrue, doesn’t excuse the final product, where characters talk while their mouths are closed and stop talking while their mouths are still open.  It’s over-all a pretty sloppy job, but the other mistake is even worse. 
See, there are several voice actors in the anime industry who have immediately distinctive voices.  I like to bring these individuals up as...  How can I put this gently...  Target practice for beginner voice chasers.  You don’t need much experience in voice chasing to recognize voices like Greg Ayres, Luci Christian, Monica Rial, Brittany Karbowski, J Michael Tatum or Hillary Haag, because while these are all fantastic actors, they can not disguise their voices for shit.  This usually isn’t a problem, as you don’t need to be a chameleon to be a good actor, but Nakaimo presents a unique circumstance.  The plot of the story revolves around finding out which member of the harem is Shogo’s little sister, and right in episode -, we’re given a brief clip of the sister’s real, unfiltered voice.  Sentai was clever enough to not credit this voice, but it uses the same actor as the eventually revealed sister character, and they used the most distinct-sounding voice actor they had.  They could have used Emily Neves, who’s actually really good at disguising her voice, but nope!  Even the most unseasoned of viewers can figure out the mystery as soon as the sister talks again. 
For this reason and this reason alone, I almost want to recommend the Japanese track with subtitles, as the sub didn’t make this mistake, but if you did that, you’d be sacrificing what actually turns out to be a pretty awesome dub.  I’ll admit that Clint Bickham is a bit awkward in the beginning, but he grows nicely into the character before long.  Monica Rial and Brittany Karbowski play his two most prominent love interests, and of course, they’re more than reliable even with the worst material, which is good, because by the end of episode -, they’ve respectively gushed to themselves over how puffy and cream-filled their boobs are and tried to badger Shogo into sticking his tongue into them through convoluted logic.  I would not trust lines like this to any other actors, so thank god the director knew what material to drop in front of what actor.  Most of the actors are newcomers and less-popular names, with the exception of veteran Tiffany Grant as the trio’s homeroom teacher, and while everyone does a pretty damn good job, none of them stand up enough to be brought up on the same platform as our three leads.  If it wasn’t for the serious misstep I mentioned earlier, I’d tell you to skip the dub and watch it in Japanese...  You know what?  Screw it, just do that.  Good acting isn’t worth spoilers. 
Off the top of my head, I can pick out two genres and one trend that have dominated the anime landscape in recent years, earning an equal amount of ire from anything but the lowest common denominator of the anime viewing community.  These genres are Harem and Moe, and the trend...  One that many critics wish would just go away and die already...  Is incest.  Specifically little sister incest, because incest without focus apparently isn’t abrasive enough.  The harem genre has been a mainstay for decades at this point, and in it’s trek through time, it’s become one of the laziest, samiest things imaginable.  I mentioned earlier that the characters were drawn to type, and that’s because there are a lot of repetitive types to draw from.  Moe hasn’t been around quite as long, but it’s become just as repetitive with it’s sexist characterizations and shameless melodramatic tragedy porn.  These three elements are copied and pasted to death because they work...  People flock to them, both here and especially in Japan, so nobody bothers changing it.  That would be all well and good, if it wasn’t for the crushing feeling that people pushing out this material know damn well that they don’t have to try. 
Well, this was more or less what I was expecting when I bought the series on DVD, but I was very quickly astounded to notice just how much this series DOES try.  It puts forth genuine effort to be more than the some of it’s parts.  If you haven’t had the mystery spoiled for you...  Which means you’re probably watching the sub...  It’s a shockingly good mystery, played out through a story that’s way more interesting than anybody should justifiably expect it to be.  A character is introduced in episode - who’s supposed to be the show’s stand-in for one of the worst harem tropes imaginable, the ever insulting “Trap” character,  and while I won’t tell you just what their deal is...  It’ll be more satisfying that way...  I can think of two reasons the character was introduced.  The first I’ll get to later, but the second ultimately makes them my favorite character in the show.  Instead of acting as a member of the harem, they exist to help Shogo unravel the mystery of his sister through their epic set of ninja investigation skills.  This in turn adds a little more depth and attention to the plot, which can often be forgotten among the tons of fanservice. 
The story has many twists and turns, and a handful of the characters do get individual arcs, which is a common enough way for a story like this to explore each member of the harem, but Nakaimo does it a little differently.  While each arc ties into the fleshing out of an individual character, they also revolve around the mystery of his sister’s identity, with each one setting up what we’re supposed to believe is a new red herring for him and his gender-neutral ninja sidekick to discuss and solve.  Each character with the exception of the student council president has their own backstory, their own tough circumstances, and their own reasons for getting tied into the mystery.  What they don’t have, however, is individual reasons to pursue Shogo, because guess what?  Half the harem don’t even really want him!  Only three of the six girls compete over him, with the other three busy pursuing their own interests that he may or may not be relevant to.  It’s a pretty sad commentary on the repetitive nature of the harem genre that THAT’s a breath of fresh air.  Having said that, I liked these characters, underwritten as they may have been, and I genuinely cared what happened to them.  Shuffle and Maken-Ki didn’t make me feel that way. 
After all that praise, you’re probably expecting me to call Nakaimo a genre defying masterpiece, right?  Oh God no.  It may be one of the better products of it’s genre, but it’s still a product of it’s genre, and as such, it comes with a lot of the same trappings.  When it comes to the writing that carries the series to it’s full run, coincidence is the rule, not the exception.  It’s hard not to roll your eyes at how the different arcs incorporate themselves into the little sister theme, from a girl claiming to be his sister to promote her little sister maid cafe to the entire school thinking Shogo’s so awesome that calling him Big Brother becomes a trend.  Even when the plot gets really interesting towards the climax, it doesn’t...  DO...  A climax, and very little is actually followed up on.  Also, I should probably mention that there’s a ton of nudity in this anime.  Not only that, but they go out of their way to show every female character named at some point...  Well, thankfully, this excludes the teacher.  I generally separate nude scenes into categories of integral, incidental and forced, and while Nakaimo’s are all over the place, most of them feel forced.  Hell, the other reason the gender-flip character exists is to guarantee maximum flesh output.  Seriously, they’re excuse for casual nudism makes the chick from MGS who breathes through her skin seem legit. 
Oh, and by the way, if you’re one of the special little snowflakes who gets triggered when they hear a work of fiction called ‘sexist,’ you might want to jump on over to one of my other works.  “You can’t call a fictional work sexist, that’s stupid, it’s not real!”  Yeah, well, there’s a reason the term pop culture has the word culture in it.  The way you write people is a reflection of the way you view them, and the popularity of the work is a reflection of how accepted that mindset is.  Nobody watches Coal Black without thinking “That’s racist.”  On that note, there are several character constructs of the harem genre that I consider sexist, and while Nakaimo only hits a few of them, it’s still really bad.  Girls holding onto a crush for well over ten years is sexist and unrealistic.  Girls becoming obsessed over a boy over a misunderstanding that makes her think they’re betrothed is sexist and paints women as idiots.  Girls being so thirsty for the D that they claim being a pedophile is better than being gay is...  Well, I’ll give them this, at least it’s a new one.  But it still ties into the harem genre’s age-old insistence that girls will obsessively want the self-insert male character, and through him, the lonely male viewer.  
If there’s one area where this show actually did come close to impressing me, it’s with the actual little sister character.  While the series begins on a note that some sexy, exploitative Imouto hijinks are about to go down, you find out by the end that while the plot line is wildly misguided, it does manage to follow a more scientific interpretation of incestuous feelings, ala the idea of Genetic Sexual Attraction.  In a nutshell, it’s been more or less proven that when two blood siblings aren’t raised as siblings, they’re genetically predisposed to find each other attractive later in life, and yeah, Nakaimo does adhere to this, whether intentionally or not.  Unfortunately, I don’t think the writers really know what they had with this material, because it’s an uncommon enough subject matter that it still deserves to be taken seriously, and some serious groundwork needs to be laid down before it can ever be approached with this level of ecchi kitsch.  I won’t spoil how the series ends, obviously, but like with all of it’s other promising aspects, it winds up dropping this ball pretty hard.  Like I said before, I do appreciate it for trying. 
Nakaimo, My Sister is Among Them is available from Sentai Filmworks, and can generally be found on Blu-Ray and DVD at a very generous ----- dollar price range.  The set comes with an OVA episode --, and while it kinda ties something off, it's ultimately not that important to the story.  The original light novel by Hajime Taguchi is not available stateside, and I’m kind of feeling like that’s a good thing, because it continues way longer than the anime, and some of the spoilers I’ve heard about the extended story have been pretty cringeworthy.  The manga adaptation, illustrated by Mottun, is also not available stateside. 
Despite it’s unfortunate history, harem anime don’t have to be bad.  They can be great, just like any other genre.  The difference is that all the good harem titles I can think of were high concept works that used the genre as a backdrop for a clear, ambitious plot that received most of the writer’s focus.  A few good examples would be Chobits and some versions of Negima.  I wouldn’t put it anywhere near the same playing field as those titles, but for what it’s worth, Nakaimo DID vastly exceed my expectations.  Of course, I was expecting it to be a -/-- piece of filth, so that’s admittedly not saying much.  It tried, and at the end of the day, that alone made me develop a soft spot for it.  There was some genuine effort that went into making this title stand out among it’s genre, and while that effort might have ultimately been bogged down and silenced by the trends and clichés of the genre, it still makes enough of an impact to show what the genre CAN be.  I enjoyed this show, I’d watch it again, and I’d even recommend it to a few people, but I’d be a bad critic if I didn’t judge it as a whole.  I give Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them a -/--.

At first glance, Narutaru appears to be some sort of shoujo 'mon series for kids. It has the most upbeat opening theme you've ever heard, and starts off fairly relaxed and uncomplicated. But initial appearances can be deceiving, and soon enough themes such as suicide, rape and genocide all start to feature prominently, all involving young teenagers. 
It's an interesting subversion of the whole Pok&eacute;mon-esque genre, and one which had the potential to work out really well. However, Narutaru is held back a number of problems, chief of which is that it only adapts the first half of the manga and doesn't compensate for the loss of the other half. Story arcs are set up and then abandoned, characters get involved and then just disappear, and most of the mysteries go unresolved. Because of this, the majority of the characters' motives and personalities are not sufficiently explored, and as such end up being rather shallow and two-dimensional, making it hard to care about what happens to them. 
The art is rather poor and in need of work. The dragon designs are not bad and are fairly varied, but that's about the best thing it has going for it. Everything looks rather bland and uninteresting, and times it looks like the artists weren't really putting the effort in at all.  
The background music is well done, helping to reinforce the dark, unsettling atmosphere of the series, which juxtaposes neatly with the deliberately ironic theme tune. 
Ultimately, Narutaru is a series with great potential that is let down by some shoddy execution. The story arcs are fairly good, but for the most part they don't go anywhere because they don't get a chance to finish. Had the series been expanded into a -- episode anime, it could perhaps have resolved the lingering plot threads and allowed some time to analyse the characters and their motives. Add in some better art and this series could have been a quite interesting take on the Pok&eacute;mon-esque genre. But the way it is, Narutaru is average at best. If you're a fan of horror anime it's just about worth checking out, but don't expect anything spectacular.

To make both the writer and reader easier to read the post, I will start to use ""Oregairu (俺ガイル)"" to refer for this series. There is also another abbreviation ""Hamachi (はまち)"". Packed in -- eps, the -st season DVD sales reached more than -k. What a fantastic number ＼(*Q* ＼) 
The title does shows there is a sign of love theme, but to justify such thinking, this one is not the same as you might think. It's not the series which offer lovey-dovey harem or ecchi scenes to please your hidden desires. Eventho' the title indicates romance in the storyline, you will find the romance only if you read the light novel. 
The anime focuses on the club helping out to solve others prob. Please mind that it's not your typical club activities in other slice-of-life anime. Rather unique this one, when you bet the comedy will come out during the club scenes, it's not necessarily wrong nor right. 
The club activity here, to help others solve their probs, is so philosophically. Yeah I do mean it. It provides guidance on how to behave in the social sphere, somewhat psychologic. 
The right point comes when the characters argue to each other using harsh words and also funny gestures. The main heroine, Yukino, is an anti-social yet mature who argues other sarcastically. My impression towards her is beyond imagination (subjectively). Other main hero(ine)s also add the comedy flavours synchronically. 
Do not dare to doubt the art and music for this series ꒰( ｀꒳´)꒱ 
I'm so captivated with such beautiful art, often using radiant colours. 
The opening theme is ""Yukitoki"" (ユキトキ) by Nagi Yanagi. Ayee! Please listen to this one. And don't forget to listen the ending theme too, ""Hello Alone"" by Saori Hayami and Nao Tōyama. 
Overall, the series is so freaking enjoyable 'til make me rate it -+! 
Pros: 
Characters, lovable and vary 
Two-thumbs up for visual 
Its story and tons of meaning 
There are jokes too!

""Romantic"" my ass.  
Plot and story: 
This short anime is about Ranmaru who recently got married. He ends up drinking on their wedding day and, obviously, becomes drunk.  The captain then takes advantage of Ranmaru's drunk state and leads him to a room on the ship where he rapes Ranmaru. Yes. Rape. Non-consensual sexual activities. 
Even if it had been with consent, there is no love story or romance. Not even friendship. The captain clearly has no interest in Ranmaru's personality or life and only wants to bang him, which is far from being romantic in my opinion. 
Characters: 
The captain is a disgrace to Italians, even though he's just a fictional character. He's clearly not interested in forming any sort of relationship with Ranmaru. Considering how he has no sense of moral, personal space or respect, I'm sure this isn't the first time he has done this either. 
As for Ranmaru, there isn't much to his character. While watching the anime, I couldn't relate to this character, his personality was flat and by the end, we don't know much about him other than about his marriage. Overall, he wasn't an interesting character. 
Design and art: 
The only plus for this forsaken anime. Ranmaru looks handsome, which is probably the only reason why Captain Rape wanted him. 
Ending: 
I think I've already made my opinion about this anime as clear as possible. 
But at least the horrifying experience was short (Thank God for that). 
Overall: 
This is just another anime that proves Japan can't create a proper yaoi and/or shounen ai anime. 
It completely skips the most important thing in a love story and jumps directly to the bed scene, as if that is what romance is all about. 
Before I watched this anime, I was expecting drama, romance and angst. Three typical things in forbidden love stories, which is what the anime was supposed to be. Did the anime have any of these things? No.  
As a hopeless romantic person, I want to see actual romance. Seeing two guys in a bed will never impress me. The love needs to be pure and the bond between the characters needs to be strong and well developed. This anime had neither of these things and failed to convince me that these two main characters love each other, which means the anime has failed to show and work with its main genre - romance. 
Such a disappointment.  
I recommend skipping this anime. Read a fanction or a doujinshi about your favorite pairing instead.

What do you get when you take a world with humans, put walking and talking animals into that world, and then proceed to have no one care? Well, you get Shirokuma ( Or Polar Bear's) Cafe.  
Story -/-- - There really isn't an overall story to Shirokuma cafe , as it is mostly episodic with its plot lines, but in all, a lot of the stories were done fantastically, and were very enjoyable. There even managed to bring in the feels at the end of the show ( which worked surprisingly well) that helped the show come to a satisfying conclusion. 
Art -/-- - I might be too generous with this one, but i found the style of the show to be a bit different from the norm, as well as fitting to the feel of the show. 
Sound -/-- - I can't remember too much about the background music, but i do remember a lot about the - openings and numerous endings to the show, all of which were memorable, with Panda Holic and the first opening being my favorite. 
Character --/--- All the characters in this show are enjoyable, funny, and most importantly, likable, so i highly doubt you'll come away from this show disliking many of the character, let alone hate them. 
Enjoyment -/--- This show is perfect for calming yourself down after watching an intense or serious anime, as the story takes itself no too seriously and is just there for you to sit back and enjoy as the Characters get themselves involved in their many antics. 
Overall -/-- - Like I said before Shirokuma cafe is a very calming , and funny, anime that can be slow at times ( Which is one of the reasons it's not a --) and is absolutely perfect after watching an intense anime, so this show is definitely one to, at the least, check out.

Wagamama is a very hard show to review, because there's not much to review- because it's really just a teaser for the VN source. From the anime standpoint, it's a slice of life about four girls that make up the student council. It's a mix of comedy and a bit of ecchi, with the girls randomly undressing and such as apparently the actual male protagonist, one of the heroine's brother no less, never shows up. There's not much to review because each of the twelve episodes is two minutes long, meaning the combined length of all the episodes is equivalent to at most one episode of a full length show. If you're looking for a show with any depth or character development, this is not it. This is just some cutely drawn girls having fun, albeit very briefly. 
Animation: 
The animation is rather basic with simplistic detailing and limited backgrounds. The coloring is bright and pretty saturated, fitting given the light, playful mood. Though the characters are nicely styled, the show shoots itself in the foot; the VN-styled ""stick"" figures featured in the post-episode sections are drawn in a vastly superior style to those in the anime. There isn't any action in the show but there is a bit of ecchi as mentioned above. The ecchi is rather light and concentrated in specific episodes. 
Sound: 
The show only has one rock-based OP/ED that is obviously created specifically for the show. Don't expect anything special for the BGM, as nothing is particularly memorable. There are four primary VAs in this show, other than Mai Gotou (who I haven't heard from in two years) they're all pretty new to me. They do a fair job though there's not a terribly lot of depth for them to bring out in the first place. 
Story: 
What story? This is essentially an episodic slice of life that just shows the student council girls hanging out in various situations. Some are more humorous or ecchi than others, but in general it's average material at best. There isn't any real tension or central plot line; it's one of those shows where you could randomize the episode order (other than the first and last episode) and still have it feel just as contiguous. 
Character: 
Again, there's not too much depth to bring out in the characters given that there's only -- total minutes of run time. In all that, I got that Toa is a bit more of the quiet type than the rest; otherwise, they're all just energetic, youthful girls. There are some nice interactions but no development given that the ""protagonist"" main male character isn't present. 
Value: 
Unless you want to play the VN or unless you absolutely have nothing to watch, I'd skip out on this teaser; there's just so much better stuff out there than this.

Ok i know the whole this anime is horrible stuff without even watching all of the episodes sounds horribly wrong in itself. But just let me get this out of my self. 
This review is for those who like to have a friend to share his lost time watching trough this anime? or for those who like to have a excuse for not watching this show at all 
those who want to watch go ahead and rate it yourself those who want real fanservice stay back. those who hate half assed art, OP powers etc. stay back and those who want the anime set a base for the story in the first episode (Like akame ga kill or shingeki no kyojin or one punc man or shigatsu wa kimi no uso etc) run like your life depend on it(Well not your life but the time you can use to see good stuff is lost, why waste it in junk)

It's been nearly - years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly - since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... - months later and ---+ episodes finished and here I am. 
I'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if I was watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a ---+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong. 
There was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters.  Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness.  
I'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself.  
What started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for --+ yrs and almost -K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.

*SLIGHT SPOILERS* 
The characters were either boring or annoying.Yuki was so annoying that after - episodes of seeing her run around whirling a genuinely cool weapon that she cannot use to save her life (literally).Honestly when you really think about it,she was not all that different from all those other girls who fawned over the Night Class guys.When she first let Zero drink her blood she said she did not care what Kaname would think of her which we find out shortly,despite claiming she did not care,she tried to hide the bite marks when she met him later and was internally screaming that he not see the marks.I feel that Kaname was fine and i liked him but his secretive nonsense was putting me off.Zero was also a good character but his whole thing with Yuki was annoying and I was sad that he didnt get much of anything without Yuki.The story could have been better and more creative.I felt that it took a typical approach.Overall,this is a disappointing anime.I have seen cats in anime who got more development than Yuki (surprise surprise)

I avoid this anime because I thought it was a full mecha fighting anime but fighting only covers a small component. I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed by this anime because it could be so much more.  
This was adapted from a visual novel - related to Steins gate but do not expect the same quality. No. You'll see that it becomes promising and then the plot just fall below average. The characters are shallow and there was a lot that could be cut out to make way for the real conspiracy.  
Some episodes were good but this anime has a continuing plotline and I think they did not space the episodes out well. If they chose well to flesh out the story and reduce the backstory for the characters, this will work better.  
Unless you have plenty of time, I won't recommend this as you will get disappointed. If you are looking for slightly futuristic sci-fi elements, I think there are other anime which offer a better execution...

After reading the reviews, I thought to myself 'Hey I will give it a try' and I wouldnt say I regret watching this anime, but jesus christ it was an interesting experience. It was really hard trying to decide which characters I preferred watching more, because the two main characters play video characters opposite of their own gender, but its like whirlwind. I watch - episodes in a row and I wanted to smash my brains in because of how clueless and how annoying these characters act. Dont be sucked in by the amazing art, story is literally garbage . I really couldnt get into it, I tried my best and tried to keep an open mind but seriously I cant wrap my brain around this. It is an interesting idea but in execution this anime falls short. It's like they tried to keep the balance between real life and video game but you either find yourself just forcing yourself to watch the parts you dont really like until they play out the latter. -/-- Its a nice idea, but nothing I ever plan on watching again.

I have to admit that it took me three attempts to get into this anime. The first episode doesn't entirely do it justice, even though it's absolutely stunning visually and story-wise. It just doesn't introduce the entirety of the show, which is quite a challenge, admittedly; since ZnT is a very complex story indeed.  
That's one of the things that I enjoyed a lot about it when I eventually sat down and watched it. This anime has a lot of layers to it, and the way they overlap and mix together is absolutely stunning. I adore the characters and the way we see them unfold and develop throughout the story. I love the twists of the storyline and the clever way mythology has been incorporated into it. The emotional conflict and the reason for why the main characters are doing what they're doing remains a mystery until almost the very end, and the moral choices they have to make keep us on our toes.  
The music and art in this anime are beautiful, absolutely stunning, flowing, top notch. Overall, I think this is one of the best short animes of this genre that I've seen.

I watched Clannad, Clannad AS, and after that bought and played to completion the VN. So it's probably safe to say that I like the Clannad series as a whole.  
Season one of Clannad sucks. Badly. There is no real way to dance around this. It falls into all the pitfalls that VN adaptions can (the awkward half-dance between doing all girl's routes and focusing on Nagisa's). It's pacing is atrocious,   ESPECIALLY in the horrendous first episode. People who rate season one of Clannad highly, in my opinion, are either factoring in Afterstory into their rating or highly susceptible to emotional tragedy porn. They're still entitled to their opinions, however. 
I want to push back on of the common criticisms of Clannad, however. Plenty of people think that Clannad sucks in part because the main heroine, Nagisa, is a ""mary sue"" type character who ""is weak and mopes around"".  
Clannad would not be better if Nagisa had some odd quirk, upbeat personality or passionate hobby. Nagisa -- and Tomoya -- are not supposed to be driven characters who try their best to succeed at the start of the show. The story of Clannad is one where two directionless souls find meaning in each other, and then persevere through life's hardships with the help of each other, and their support networks. 
Perhaps the concept of ""finding life's meaning through a relationship"" bothers some people, as maybe it should, but that doesn't mean Clannad is a  better story if Nagisa has her shit together at the start of the show.

While traveling through Japan this April, I noticed a lot of manga and game shops featuring this work (either in VN or manga form). Thus, I held perhaps a tad too much expectation for this work from Minato Soft (whose prior works include Majikoi and Kimi ga Aruji). Shokomeza is about a group of high schoolers coming together to create a bishoujo game, not terribly differentiated from another show with the same theme a few seasons back- Saekano. Again, we start with a protagonist with a seemingly hopeless future, who through meeting a girl decides to do his best to make a game. In this case, Bunta is not a fluffy stuffed animal but rather a writer who makes scripts for the drama club. Will he and the rest of his soon-formed club successfully ""master up?"" 
Don't be led astray by the Minato Soft tag, this show focuses much more on the game creation process than any deep character relationships; you won't find a harem here. The show comes across as a marginally interesting slice of life, which starts very slow (like bedtime story slow) but then eventually starts clicking once deadlines start approaching. If you're looking for a relatively light show where, honestly, not much happens until the end, this is for you. If you're looking for deep relationships or insights as to how to really make a gal game, you're not going to find much here. If you're just looking for a random show to pick up, chances are you'll have better luck elsewhere. 
Animation: 
The animation is pretty good, which is to say it's up to current standards. The show uses a moderately saturated color palette, though the overall feel is a bit dull due to the gray uniforms and plain school walls. The backgrounds are slightly above average with nice attention to details, like rust on desks or swings; with a few add moments of artistic brilliance, such as a panning shot of mugs and plates. The characters are decently drawn but nothing in particular stands out from other shows. Redhead Andou is really the only spice in terms of color you get in addition to a few nice, sunset-hued skies. Emotions are fair but nothing special as well, in fact it is a tad annoying that Kuroda is a kuudere (with an overwhelming focus on the kuu) given the amount of screen time she hogs. 
This is neither an action nor an ecchi show. There are a few bit of ecchi such as a few BL references, a self-proclaimed ""fan service"" episode where everyone goes to the beach, and a maid scene- but really, compared to recent harems this is comparatively nothing. 
Sound: 
I find it funny that the show chose a song that started with ""despair"", though I guess it fits with the lightly utilized ""wasteland"" theme. The opening is a fast-paced, action-oriented song, which isn't a particularly great melody and furthermore doesn't seem to fit with the mostly-calm nature of the show. The show's ED features the girls of the show and has a fair melody. The BGM is standard-fare filler pieces that are lightly mixed in- be warned that this will put you to sleep if you're not on guard. There's a central, four note melody that is featured throughout the show. 
The characters in this show weren't particularly engaging, and I'm not sure of the casting choices as well. Using a relative newcomer, Haruka Chisuga, as the kuudere female lead was risky and didn't work too well for me. Kanahana is at her best voicing relatively shy girls, which is exactly not the drama club star Yuuka. Though it was a good effort overall, it just came across lackluster. 
Story: 
Alright, I admit it; I have absolutely no idea what the intended story of this show is. At points, it tries to tell of the brutal, fast-paced, and deadline oriented gaming industry. At other points, it tries to lighten the mood with the playful essence of youth, adding in trips to the beach and the local yakiniku shop. Additionally, at other points, it tells of the dramas the club faces with sickness, slumps, and outright desertions. With all of these, you end up with a weird balancing act of a story that goes in multiple directions and yet ends up not moving very far from where it started. Somehow, it manages all this while the main plot remains utterly predictable. Perhaps the intent was to focus more on the characters, but more on that in the next section. 
In addition to the odd execution, I felt that the pacing was also jarring. The first few episodes were so plain that I felt it was already in the drop-worthy category. There aren't a lot of plot twists and the overall tension of the story hovers at a mediocre level until the final few episodes, where all of a sudden everyone is energized by the impending deadline; in fact, the show ought to just be renamed ""The Procrastinator's Guide to Game Making."" 
That brings me to my final complaint, which is that the show keeps you at distance from the actual game making logistics and product- you barely get even a few glimpses of what they're actually making. Furthermore, somehow, being the younger sister of a game designer is apparently enough to know everything about the industry- and so Kuroda magically solves how to procure background art, BGM, and how and who to communicate with throughout the entire process. Oh, and somehow everyone still goes to school though they never show how the students balance everything. 
It's one of those shows where at the very end you question why you even bothered picking it up in the first place. 
Character: 
The show has a good variety of character archetypes in the club but fails to really make them engaging. All the characters are pretty static and, other than the protagonist, really don't get much of an exposition. There's only a slight hint of any character relationships and, well, as with the school uniform colors, everything just feels kind of dull. There weren't too many supporting characters, which is even more reason why I would have expected a deeper, more engaging main cast. 
In any case, you get a pretty cookie-cutter set of girls with the outgoing VA Yuuka, bad-girl programmer Andou, know-it-all kuudere Kuroda, and shy artist Yuuki. Our protagonist writer doesn't know what to do with his life, moving between random jobs and finally finds something he likes doing with the group Rokuhara. And finally, he brings along his ""nice guy"" childhood friend who hates couples after getting dumped. The group interactions are fair overall but nothing I'd consider particularly special. 
Value: 
This is not a harem and it is not really a drama. It's perhaps just a slice of life loosely wrapped around the theme of making a game. If you have hours of time to waste on a show, spare yourself and choose something else. In this show about how it is difficult to make a game, we end up seeing how it is difficult to make a good anime.

I really don’t know about this series. I know for sure that it WAS NOT good, but I don’t really know what to think about it and what exactly I liked and disliked about the series. I know that it looked really pretty and there were some beautiful moments, but many of these key scenes didn’t have a purpose that was fulfilled by how they looked. Its as if the show wanted to look nice just to look nice and the images didn’t enhance the plot as much as they should have.  
Speaking of the plot, it was mostly hit or miss with both the first and second halves feeling weak in their own ways. The first half had some enjoyable parts but the main cast didn’t really mesh together in any real or believable way, and most characters didn’t have anything to really like about them. Many were bland and didn’t have much purpose aside from either being an obstacle or fulfilling an aside that fed into the main conflict. Kumiko was likable to an extent and received the most development, and I can really appreciate that she isn’t put into a certain mold and feels conflicting and layered enough that she feels the most real, but she was a character that would have been better served in a better plot.  
The plot was, personally, the weakest part of the series in part to how inconsequential it felt at times, and how many of the surrounding elements did not service it in a meaningful way. What I mean by this is that many of the asides that the series which served to either flesh out the world, provide character development, or explain the situation in a practical way, didn’t seem to have much impact because the time spent developing these scenes did not, in turn, provide a similarly large effect on the world. Often the understandings of other characters to what is happening or the status quo does not change and it feels like most of these moments could have easily been tossed aside and it almost seems like they were. That is not to say that certain scenes such as Kumiko and Rikka on the mountain aren’t memorable, but that it instead feels like it came out of nowhere and disappeared without any real impact on what is going on. You could call it subtlety and say that development on these characters is meant to be subdued and realistic, but even in that case it doesn’t work because we do not spend enough time getting to know these people to really know how their feeling. Other than Kumiko who, admittedly, did believably change over the course of the series.  
Aside from this, the series feels the need to shove all development down our throat with useless narration which often repeats to us things we could understand just by watching what is happening, and most of the time comes off as redundant and unnecessary which ultimately takes you out of the experience.  
As a whole, the plot showed promise, particularly at the beginning where the destination and the obstacles were made clear and the possibilities of truly coming together while working towards something meaningful as a group seemed like what the series was aiming for, while emphasizing the attempted repair of an awkward friendship. The problem, I think, is that the series was too short. I faulted the series’ inconsequential asides but I believe if this same story was told over more episodes and we really got to know more members of the band then while seeing them all interact would have given the story more impact as we see how the events of the story matter to them and better understand what makes them who they are. Instead nothing feels like it really matters because as certain elements are introduced, they often don’t have a worthwhile conclusion or don’t add anything to the story. They may tell you more but not enough that you know why it matters.  
As the story progresses certain events only add unnecessary drama or hold the overall plot back either because the whole story also has the misfortune of being largely predictable, and because they do not add any further tension when the stakes were clearly established and characters act in a way that defy what is best for everyone and holds everyone back.  
Finally, and this is much more personal, I did not enjoy Kumiko and Rikka’s relationship. To be clear, most of the characters lacked meaningful relationships, but I did not see a reason to enjoy their’s in particular. Nor did I see any reason to justify them as a yuri pairing. NONE AT ALL. I am being entirely serious. None of their interactions in the beginning gave me any reason to believe either of them even liked each other nor do they even seem to get along most of the time. They just have vaguely romantic moments that serve no purpose and feel very out of place.        
All in all, I don’t hate the series, but I do have many problems with it, and would easily say that it is my least favorite Kyoto Animation show of recent memory. I can give credit to Kumiko being likable enough to make some parts bearable, and for the ending actually feeling fulfilling. However, most everything else was not enjoyable and I began to actively dislike the show by the -rd quarter. I didn’t like the characters, I didn’t like how the plot flowed, and while the show is beautiful, the art does not add anything nor do anything to bring you closer to the world. Its pretty but without substance.

I really have to say, this movie had a lot of potential,  It could have been a very sweet, calm, artsy philosophical anime. And if it was a -hr or at least an one hour anime that really grasped the audience's attention it would have gotten a --. however the fact of the matter is it starated out very nicely but then I could feel that director of this anime just rushed the ending making a lot of loose ends and just really ruining this anime.

Evangelion is widely considered one of the most influential anime created in the ----'s, if not of all time. It is extremely well known for it's brave attempts to turn the mecha genre on it's head, it's deep character development, and it's unorthodox storyline. Created by acclaimed studio Gainax, and written by both praised (and sometimes hated) writer Hideaki Anno, Evangelion has been called a masterpiece by anime fans. Does it deserve this praise. 
Simply, yes. 
Story: One of the most well known aspects of Evangelion is it's story; it is simply unorthodox, as it does the process of not feeding all of the story the viewer; it drip-feeds it, giving the viewer only half the story, or sometimes giving scenes without any context. For some anime, this would be a disaster waiting to happen, but in the case of Evangelion, this is done almost consistently masterfully, holding back information on such subjects such as SELEE or The Angels.  Many have critisized the holding of frames later in the series, but taken into the context of the fact they were running out of money to make the show, is is understandable.  
For many fans, their major criticism of the anime is the handling of the ending, which many consider far too 'out there' and simply crap. I too, am not a huge fan of the ending, but taking the ending to the TV series, inside the context of the 'true' ending movie, The End of Evangelion, the ending can make a lot more sense, and thus I enjoy it far, far more. To stop me from ranting on for ages, Evangelion's story is a master stroke in writing, one which has been a hard feat to replicate. 
Art and Sound: I was introduced to Evangelion through the in-progress tetraology of films, The Rebuild of Evangelion; due to this, I became used to the cutting edge graphics employed for the higher-budget films. And to be honest, yes, the TV series art is beginning to show it's age -- years on; however, this does not detract from the series in any major capcity, as the art compliments the anime extremely well. 
The sound is also fantastic, and a very high-point for the show. Excellent music is employed to showcase the fights against the Angels, and for darker moments such as the internal struggles of the main cast of the show. Some of Beethoven's music is featured later in the series, which coupled with the emotional impact of the scene, produces one of the most excellent scenes in anime history. 
Characters: By a massive leap, the highlight of the series. Evangelion features in it's story the struggles of the main characters, to devastatingly wonderful effect. Weak, timid, daddy-issues Shinji, to powerful, arrogant, egotistical Asuka, to the quiet, mysterious Rei, and the dark, apparently agnostical Gendo, Evangelion develes into the mind and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them tick, and this is what gives us some animes most regonisable and wonderful characters. 
I am certain entire essays have been written on why certain charcters tick, and that's another reason so many of these characters are so wonderful. Fans are so devoted to their favorite characters (personally I am partial to Rei and Gendo), and this creates a wonderful feeling when learning about these characters and then discussing this with other fans. Generally, Evangelion employs some of the most human characters in anime, showing us that the heroes of anime aren't always strong, both mentally and physically, or not even in control of their lives. 
In closing, Evangelion is one of the strongest anime ever produced. It employs powerful characters, a deep, deep story, and art that has only just began to show it's age. What makes the show's longevity even more powerful is that even now on sites such as EvaGeeks people are still analysing this series, trying to know everything about it. I hope Evangelion will live on in the hearts of it's fans, who'll continue to appreciate it's deep, metaphorical story. I hope that Evangelion will always remain an anime that will be treasured, for all the ages.

SUMMARY 
-Interesting groundhog day time loop mechanic which is central to the story 
-Characterization is pretty heavily reliant on tropes, but is still executed well; very good character development for a few characters 
-Writing and dialogue is inconsistent.  Sometimes it's cliche, but in a few episodes there are moments of greatness. 
-A few weird directing choices which made the show feel tonally inconsistent 
-Pretty violent, but still pretty heavy on dialogue overall 
-Decent opening and ending themes; very good voice acting; a couple of very interesting standouts from the soundtrack 
**NOT A REAL ENDING.  The anime ends at a story arc, but it's not even close to resolving everything in the story.  Lots of dangling plot threads which may or may not eventually get an adaptation. 
-Overall, makes for a solid, fun, action adventure story in a fantasy setting 
------------------ 
FULL REVIEW 
STORY - - 
The story is interesting and gripping from the start with the Groundhog Day style of time loop.  Despite the fact that you often witness events multiple times, they are able to keep it interesting and fresh. 
The writing is often quite good.  They explore the time loop mechanic in ways that make sense, and they rarely leave you asking ""why didn't they do X or Y with this time loop mechanic?""   
There are some times, however, where the drama feels over the top and forced.  Sometimes it feels as if characters behave in uncharacteristic ways, and it can be frustrating.  They sometimes try to milk a scene for more drama than it's worth; in this way, it sometimes feels like the writing does not show any proper amount of restraint. 
The most blatant problem with the story is that it does not end.  This is a problem with anime generally in the past several years.  We rarely get proper endings to stories.  Just because this is common, it does not excuse this show.  I might have given story a - if this show had an ending.  Despite my complaints about the drama, the writing is usually interesting and engaging, which is more than can be said of most shows.   
ART - - 
The art is serviceable.  It's another show that has this modern simple and clean style to it.  Not much shading, not too many details in the character's faces.  The show essentially looks like most other shows out there today (circa ----).  The animation is pretty good for the action scenes.  There are a few moments where the art and animation are bumped up for scenes wherein they go for that higher level of drama.  I would probably give the art an - if not for the fact that I think the modern, simple art style in anime doesn't look that great.   
SOUND - - 
This might actually be the best part of this show, technically speaking.  The voice acting is great, perhaps top tier for anime in ----.  One of the antagonists (my brain trembles!) in particular is really good.  The voice completely sells the character.   
There are a few great pieces from the soundtrack which are very memorable.  The opening and ending themes are fine.  Sound effects are good but probably not much better than industry standard today.  Given that it's an action series there is more work to do in this regard than a typical high school show, and as far as I can tell they do it fine. 
CHARACTER - - 
The characterization is fairly heavily reliant on tropes, but it is executed well.  The main character does feel like his own person, instead of a bland self-insert character.  Supporting females leads are quite good.   
The best part of the characterization is the character development of two characters in particular, one of them being the main character. 
However, one of the worst parts of the characterization is also the main character.  There are times in this show where he acts like a complete idiot in a way which seems out of character and which is forced for drama.  Nonetheless, this eventually resolves.  It's only a problem for a few episodes. 
ENJOYMENT - - 
There are some weird choices made with the directing that sometimes made this show feel inconsistent.  There are some episodes where they try to go for a more cinematic feel which I thought was a very strange choice.  The emotional tone in this show is practically schizophrenic at times.  Nonetheless, the writing is usually engaging and you want to know what's going to happen.  The character development is occasionally frustrating, but the resolution to certain characters arcs is usually very, very satisfying.  The lack of ending is a big problem though.  I would have left the show feeling more of a sense of enjoyment if it had a proper ending. 
You can definitely have fun with this show, and it is occasionally thought-provoking. 
OVERALL 
This show is fun, it's more thought-provoking than your usual action adventure show, and the characterization is above average in quality.  The fantasy setting is interesting, but most of the time the feel is actually more mundane and character focused.  There are some gimmicky trope characters that are probably just in there to bait otakus.  But overall, there's not a lot to complain about in this show. 
There's not much fanservice.  Overall, this might make for a good -nd or -rd anime.  I don't think I would pick this show as a first anime to recommend to someone. 
The re-watch value of this show is questionable, since a decent amount of the fun comes from the suspense of not knowing what will happen next.  Additionally, the character development was a nice surprise to watch as it unfolded.  You lose the sense of discovery on a repeat viewing.  I could still see people enjoying this on repeat viewings though.

WATCH OUT! This review and rating is based on Hentai scale. Parental discretion is advised. 
It's the Hentai Man! Once again, let's get it on, guys! WUHU! PARTY... It doesn't help anything you all see what is the topic this time... Seisen Gakuin... RUN! RUN! Don't let it capture you! 
STORY 
The story is about a teacher (who always isn't very popular with his female students) who get's kinda ""overwhelmed"" by a student, who seem to be cursed or something. After the sex scene, the teacher may be possesed by the curse, as well, because the girl is showin' him a artefact(?) that looks lik a huge, purple dildo. However. After that, he gets it on with a colleague, a female teacher. She recognize that he has... the power?! Then, the -rd ""sacrifice"" is a girl, who gets swimming lessons from our teacher. 
ART&SOUND 
Okay, now it's time for my oppinion. Seisen Gakuin is one of the worst piece of a Hentai i've ever seen in my entire career as ""myself"": Seisen Gakuin has the audacity TO USE BIBLE BLACK SOUNDFILES! YES! I heard - or - Bible Black Soundfiles in this piece of... stuff! The animations are just a joke and the art kind ""trembles"" between standard and ""Mikey, his first year in the Kindergarten"" 
OVERALL 
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?! Seriously, it is a wonder that more than --- people actually know this piece of nothing. The story is so stupid that you only think ""WHY?!"" As far as i remeber, than in the Hentai they NEVER mention, that this dildo-look-a-like is a artefact and that it has got magical powers. If you don't read this review or if you don't read MyAnimelists description, you don't know it! After the act with the girl a huge lightning appears as something like a ""rope"" between the dildo and the teacher. WHAT THE HELL?! After that he can't stop urinating anymore, then you whitness a short fetish scene between him and the female teacher, who says something like ""You must be the choosen one"" HUUUH?! After that our teacher changes his mind for no damn reason: Suddenly he isn't the foolish teacher anymore, no, he is the man who uses the girls... rough! (MAYBE it is because, he realized that he has ""the power"" or stuff like that.) 
Seisen Gakuin. Only - episode, after that it is done. YES! The only good thing is, that it uses some Bible Black Soundfiles. Yep. That is everything. The only good thing is, that it copies something. WHAT IS THAT?! All right, the dubbing is pretty good, but that is something like a standard, isn't it? 
To show some mercy with this ""thing"", i'll give it -/-- Points. 
WARNING: DON'T WATCH THIS! You might regret it! =)

I wasnt expecting much when watching this anime i just found it randomly and thought this look interesting. And here is what i got. Gosik takes detective stories to another place if one might say its one of those anime that makes the a new version of the genre.  
Storywise the anime is set in another earth if you might but you do get the feeling that they use alot of older western names in them. Helvetia are one of the to give an example. Its engaging and fun yet gives you the mysterious and sad feel for the main characters in it. I like to say that this anime gives me what i desire when i look for a new type of detecitve anime. Some of it might be things you have seen similarities with but in the end its all something that is true only to that world and even harder to copy.  
The sound gives of the old gothic world if one might call it that and the opening gives that too.  
The main character might feel pathetic at times but the combination with his female other he becomes interesting to listen to. Though much of that i will give to the female that if you watch this anime you will be more familiar with. Some of the bad characters in the anime are more of the typical anime like ones but others have a more sick mind one might say which gives you that feeling that you want to dislike them or even hate them.  
I might not be objective but its how i feel it when i give it its -/--. The truth is that this anime is one of those rare pieces of detective work that other anime have problem finding. Instead of grabbing simple mysteries they create their own and this make this anime worth watching for all there is.

Lucky Star. With an odd title like that, one is left to wonder what this show is all about. A more appropriate and less obscure name would be &quot;Killing yourself with boredom&quot;. 
Just want a moment to say this. OVERRATED. You could watch the first few minutes of Lucky Star or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar. 
I wasnt sure on what to do with this anime. Was it supposed to be funny? How? I cant find one thing about it funny! Am I supposed to enjoy how Im able to relate to them? &quot;Hey dude, that fictional, animated girl on the T.V just farted, so did I!&quot; Well I'll be damn. 
This anime is just screaming out the word boredom. Who on earth would want to watch schoolgirls talk about the different ways to cut food for five friggin minutes? Surprisingly, millions of em. Even after contemplating for a long period of time, I can not fathom why anyone would want to watch this. To be honest, I dont go for slice of life anime's but I am assured that this is an insult to slice of life anime's everywhere. We deserve better than this piece of ****. 
The animation and the voice acting is the only saving grace here. The rest are piss. The characters are shallow, comedy is not comedic, and lets not forget about how blunt the story is. 
School Rumble has nothing to fear from this destitute, brain-numbing show. 
If I were you I would rather take a brick, apply it to my forehead with force: Trust me, it&rsquo;ll hurt less than trying to make sense of this anime.

Rated a - (fine) 
seen via english sub 
Story was a -. It pains me but it is. Unlike the other two anime show titles that follow with this... this seems quite confusing. Is this a wayback machine episode? if so was in going forwards or back? Was it going in both directions? Was this showing the other students that were mentioned in the previous shows but never shown? An indication of context would have been lovely but they did not. Perhaps the manga mentioned it? 
Art: Rated a - as well. I will admit it was a slightly different approach from what it normally done. However, they went with the manga to anime approach. Love the approach, honest. Yet, you ruined anime for me for a little bit. 
sound: -. Vocals matched the characters portrayed. I would have been happier again with english dub. 
Character: An easy rate of three. Sorry developers but those girls look like boys. It throws the art into a direction that ruins it for me. 
Enjoyment was harder to rate. I am going to side with my character rating. 
Overall a -/-. Come on developers if you start with what this show normally does and you toss in some random stories you can't expect your viewers to reward you with praise. To me it was an insult.

*SPOILERS* 
Basically this is gonna be a rant about the leading male character.  You have been warned.  
He almost has no emotions. His motives aren't explained at all. For example, why does he take care of her at the start? They weren't really friends before that. The became friends afterwards. Because her apartment is too messy and she doesn't eat healthy food? So what? I bet a lot of people live like that. Is he gonna help out every random person he meets? 
Why does he put up with her awful personality? Again they weren't friends. We never see him showing any signs of falling for her or anything so that crap about loving her for who she really is, is bull. If he had a crush on her or something so he did all that but she wasn't aware of that *friendzone* that'd be far better than what we got. 
He doesn't know what he wants. He switches from one girl to another real quick. And of course the - main female characters in the show fall for him. OK, Taiga falling for him is understandable. Minori suddenly can't stand his charms? Ah, well, we'll let it slide. But why did they have to make the model fall for him too? It's like they know he's the main character so they have to fall for him. It would've been excused if he was particularly handsome or charming but he isn't. So why do they all fall for him?

Shangri-La is a weird show to me because I honestly can't tell who this show is for. With a long list of story lines and plot threads all mashed up together, all trying to tell there own stories with varied tones and subject matter, you would think in all of that there would at least be something you can like about this show, or at very least something positive to take away from it. In actuality this show feels like what was intended to be many different ideas that were intended to have their own series devoted to them got crammed together like some sort of anime soup. I don't mean to take away from the writer though, in actuality I thought that many of the plot elements in this show had potential.  
What could have been is sort of the tune I'll be singing to though. From the very start of episode one I felt this way. At first it seems like a interesting take on the post apocalyptic setting, In which the worlds polar ice caps are melting at such an alarming rate that populations across the world are forced to consolidate their living space and leave most big cites to be taken over by the forest out of necessity to keep the worlds carbon balance at bay. This show also shows what a word economy based on carbon would be like, these are actually some of the most entertaining parts of the show to me but I realize I'm not everyone.  
And this is where the biggest problem this series is put in full spot light, the main character Kuniko is one of the least interesting people in the story. There are a TON of interesting sub-plots in this show that easily overshadow the ""main story."" The only interesting things that happen in this show are things that usually have little to nothing to do with Kuniko. I guess I just personally dislike her to some extent simply because I was much more interested in the side characters. So I beg ask the question, Is it that Kuniko is badly written or that the supporting cast is just written better than she is? I don't rightfully know myself, if you decide to watch this then I guess you will come to your own conclusions. The supporting cast I mentioned before is quite interesting, and in some resects is worth checking the show out for. You have Momoko, the trans-sexual motherly figure to Kuniko ( wow, I never thought I'd write that). Karin the carbon terrorist (sort of) and just over all economical badass. And Mikuni-sama, the mysterious little girl that carries a strange disease that doesn't allow her to go out in the sun, but does seemingly give her some horrifying powers. And Kuniko has a boomerang, riveting. The characters do give this show some redeeming qualities so if you are just looking for a few neat characters to tickle your fancy (not like that) then you could pick a worse show. 
The story is still a mess though.  
""Okay, lets have an episode with a lot of action in it!"" 
""Wont that drain our budget and force us to spend way too long focusing on the supporting cast since Kuniko is a action based character?"" 
""Shut up! No one will care about this show if we don't blow most of our budget on the first half! 
Now animate some more explosions and have that one chick beat up the waiter guy again, that doesn't make people feel uncomfortable at all."" 
Shangri-La is very average in my opinion. It has some good things going for it, but at the same time a lot of stupid crap as well. Mediocre is probably the best way to describe this in short. 
This show has been licensed by Funimation, and is relatively cheap on DVD. If you are wondering there is a english dub that is quite serviceable. There is also a French dub if thats you thing. 
This show gets a -/-- in my book, but I do recommend it if you don't mind sitting through a bit of a mess. Thank you for reading, please tell me if you found this helpful.

RE: Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is an anime that builds up your expectation to such a point that you start thinking that its going to be a masterpiece, only to end up going nowhere near your expectations. It's a very promising anime that could have been made into something great if more effort were given into it. 
The anime is without a doubt over-rated in MAL, being ranked #--. Once again to prove that the ratings in MAL are meaningless. 
I think the setup of the anime is pretty good, only the story didn't go anywhere. If this is reproduced with a solid story, it truly has the potential to become a masterpiece.

The ending theme ""Stay Alive"" was superb. The art of the anime is actually amazing. To younger viewers it can be disturbing at some points though with all the gore and stuff.

Enjoyment does't follow logic. Instead of all the mess-ups in the story, the anime is darn enjoying.

Some people rated this anime too low. I think you shouldn't let your emotions mess up your judgement. Yes, the anime was disappointing not to meet the expectations it built up. But that's no reason for you to rate it so low. The anime could have been a --/--, nevertheless it still deserves to be rated at least -.

The quality of animation is awesome, I think this is the most beautiful art make by Bones and one of the best in all animes. Congratulations for studio Bones, they make a greatful job in all technical criterias. 
All characters have a indescribable charisma, this is worth to Atsushi Ohkubo (manga autor) that makes the work so great.  
This is one of the best enjoyment in a shounen anime that I've seen, the comedy, the actions scenes and the story works perfectly at least until episode ----- when the fillers started. 
Trust me, this anime is the most example of how fillers can crash a anime and this is what makes me sick about it. If the anime follows the manga could be a top -- anime, but unfortunately this don't happens. 
The anime is not so bad, the fillers are better then much original anime ends, but when you read the manga you see how disappointing is the anime. I don't know why this happens (and I don't wanna know). 
For me it's a -, just for the first half of the anime, what I recommend is read the manga

Kotonoha no Niwa, or The Garden of Words is a short anime movie depicting a troubled teenager,  Takao Akizuki, and a young woman in an identity crisis, Yukari Yukino. In this movie both these character often skip their responsibilities to relax in a small gazebo in a lush garden. One day they happen to meet each other in this sanctuary and a beautiful, yet hidden bond starts to form between them. 
Story: -/-- 
One of the most amazing prospects of this film is its simplicity.  Something I was not expecting considering that the writer, director, and producer of this film is Makoto Shinkai; famous for creating  Byousoku - Centimeter, which happens to be almost the very opposite of Kotonoha no Niwa. Sitting at approximately -- minuets long, Shinkai tells a quick story with a mature romance involving our two main characters, Yukino and Akizkui. It is also very straight-forward which compliments this mature feeling that Shinkai has displayed throughout the movie. It pulls no tricks or confusing metaphors, it lays it all out on the table and tells you exactly what to expect from the story the second these two meet, and then it delivers it by revealing the problems step at a time. 
Art: --/-- 
Do I really even need to talk about the art in the movie? Hands down one of the most well made animations I've seen to this day. CoMix Wave Films, the studio of both this and Byousoku - Centimeter, once again delivers with amazing quality that is sure to make you think just one simple word ""Wow!"". I literally was blown back by the attention to detail in this movie, whether it is the cutting of vegetables, the action of pencil on paper, or even the rain hitting the ground, and as someone who loves rain, but has recently moved to the desert (thanks SoCal) this film had me gushing of excitement over those little droplets from the sky. The most impressive thing about the art in Kotonoha no Niwa is its ability to even convey what emotion each character is feeling through only body movements and facial expressions, something that is very hard to do in animation. CoMix Wave Films once again sets a very high bar for other studios trying to compete (looking at you KyoAni) and I believe that it will continue to hold that bar high up for years to come. 
Sound: --/-- 
Music and other sound effects serve two purposes in media; to make the film more realistic with sound effects, and to serve as a compass for the audience so they know which way the scene is heading and how to later interpret said scene. Kotonoha no Niwa handles the sound perfectly, even the many scenes of them just sitting under the roof of the gazebo had impact due to the music and sound effects. I truly believe that had this film removed dialogue either completely or even in favor of small tidbits of dialogue as done in many old-timey movies, it would still be very easy to understand and well received.  
Character: -/-- 
""It's okay, we're human, after all. We've all got our little quirks"" - Yukari Yukino. 
This quote pretty much sums up the entirety of both Yukino and Akizuki. Both are characters with small problems of their own and unique, yet realistic ways of dealing with them that everyone who has encountered a bump in the road of life can relate with. These characters don't do anything out of the ordinary given the situations they're placed in, and because it is so simple and relatable one can't help but be intrigued by their small quirks. An aura of maturity mixed with some irresponsibility is a little charm that both these characters also display and is a big part of why the audience will be attracted to them, just as they were to each other.  These characters are the epitome of normality mixed with small everyday excitement that everyone secretly dreams of whether their dozing off in school or during a meeting.  
The side characters for this show are mostly non-existent and do little to progress the actual story as it is primarily focused around the two main characters, however in the few moments where the side-characters are important (won't discuss for sake of spoilers) they are not as fleshed out as they should be despite their importance. This is why I unfortunately cannot give character a perfect score. 
Enjoyment: --/-- 
This section is mostly going to be about my personal preferences and why I gave it a --/--.  
Kotonoha no Niwa is very short compared to other anime; yet it manages to tell a better story than a majority of other anime despite given six times as much time as your average -- min -- episode cour anime. As someone who has found himself busier and busier with work and school nearly everyday, Kotonoha no Niwa was a gift from above, it allowed me to spend my limited free time enjoying something I love very much, watching good anime. Not only does it's time frame fit perfectly for a busy-body like me, but it also includes my favorite genre, romance. I have seen many romance works of art and my favorite has always been ones where the story is very mature and doesn't play around, which is exactly what Kotonoha no Niwa gave me. I didn't have to wait around for a tsundere to figure out the correct way to say ""I love you"", or have confessions be interrupted over and over again through stupid comedic gags (ITS NOT FUNNY); so when I watched Kotonoha no Niwa I felt very relieved to see that a -- year old boy and a -- year old woman would act exactly how I expect them to when faced with ""I love you"". Lastly, the rain. I mentioned it above, I am a MASSIVE lover of rain, the calming pitter-patter against the window as I chill-out inside or on the deck and just look at nature. Rain is a beautiful thing and I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a huge part as to why I enjoyed this film so much. 
Overall: --/-- 
Although it has it's flaws, they are very minor. Kotonoha no Niwa delivers a beautifully short and mature love story between a teenager and a young woman. The story is very straight forward and easy to understand. The art and sound will blow you away with astonishing attention to detail. The characters are very realistic, intriguing, and relatable. Even if you're not a fan of romances or short stories, Kotonoha no Niwa is a gorgeous short film that you should not hesitate to add to your completed list.

I'm assuming that you've already watched the original EVA series before watching the movie before reading this. If not, spoilers abound. 
So yes, this is basically a retelling of the original Evangelion in movie mode, and it's the first of - movies. This first movie covers the first six episodes of the original series, therefore not exactly innovative or anything shockingly interesting about the story. However, they did remove most of Shinji's self-pitying/emo-ing/bitching moments, so it's definitely one improvement from the original series.  
The art is simply fabulous. The original series already had excellent artwork for its generation, and they've managed to improve it. Introduction of CG was definitely a great move, and it made scenes even better, especially the fighting parts. They completely redid the scene with the Angel Ramiel, replacing traditional hand-drawn Ramiel with CG designs. Needless to say, that scene turned into absolute eye-candy. Other uses and integration of CG were more subtle, such as introducing it into the graphs, computer charts, and background. The human character designs were sharpened a bit from the original, but otherwise remained unchanged.  But it was integration of CG into this remake which really stole the light. 
The sound remained mostly the same, but they did add new sound effects, most notably to the EVAs and Angels, and an excellent new ending song. 
Characters remained virtually the same, except they cut out a lot of Shinji's bitching/whining, so definitely a good move. Made the movie a lot more enjoyable, as we only seen about - minutes of whining, opposed to the half episodes of manbitching in the original series. 
Seeing this movie was definitely fun to watch, because they basically took the original series, and remade with better graphics, with a few minor changes, so that it's enjoyable to watch without feeling it's the same as the original series, yet not different enough that it strays away from its original roots. This definitely will bring back nostalgic feelings from older fans whilst giving something new for them to watch and admire.  
This movie is actually a good enough retelling that a newcomer to EVA can watch this instead of the original series, and will be able to know nearly everything that happened. (Of course, it's not really recommended, seeing how it's the original that was so profound and revolutionary.) After seeing this, I have high hopes for the following three movies, although I am a bit doubtful about the last one.

There will be some spoilers due to how the show wraps itself up being a main sticking point of the review. Fair warning. 
It took me a while to remember I even watched this show several years ago on a whim. But it all came back to me mostly on how simple it was. It was a short binge and there was nothing particularly wrong with the show itself, but there's really nothing to it mostly due to how short it was and a refusal to commit to any particular mood or genre entirely. It's rated as high as is purely because visuals are decent and what little plot there is is in one piece despite this. 
The premise is simple. Catgirl aliens have landed and are basically the best thing that's ever happened to humanity. The show tries to also play to the old ""government conspiracy"" trope by having various governments in league with dog aliens that have been trying to hide aliens and all that, but it never comes across as fully threatening to anything in a believeable way. We get a lot of tell not show of both factions and the whole thing just feels like a 'throw it in' gimmick to justify the catgirls. In that respect it fails to be a decent sci-fi show. 
Mostly this show is billed as a harem comedy but it fails in both those respects as well. The harem consists of three girls with no real memorable qualities to speak of other than ""catgirl lead"", ""tsundere childhood friend"", and ""meek glasses girl."" There's never any of the shifting dynamics or character development that you would normally get in this sort of genre. It's made clear from the start the girls all get along and even root for each other. The fact that they all just agree to share the generic protagonist in the end surprises nobody. The show also simply isn't all that funny so it's not particularly harem or comedy. 
There's a protagonist. He's as bland as can be imagined. I wish there were more to this but I literally remember nothing about him and frankly the entire rest of the show could have taken place without him were a handful of girls not be in need of someone to kiss at. 
I don't even remember why I decided to watch this in the first place looking back. I know it's been a long time and while various scenes and episodes still stick out to me to remind me that I did, in fact, watch it, there was nothing cohesive or decisive about it. Not genuinely bad but otherwise incredibly bland.

It was when I was still in elementary school, after long hours of studying, I would immediately open our television and watch Yakitate!! Japan. The anime about bread-making but basically, baking. At ----, I came to re-live my childhood and watch the whole serie. I wasn't disappointed. 
This anime is no doubt, one of the classics even though it targeted many popular anime and did some cross-overs. But, I am getting ahead of myself. I think the story is original in many levels; however, it was a little repetitive. The plot is very good. It isn't just an anime that entails how to bake a bread and its ingredients but its actually more than that. Taking each and every episode that varies from one episode to another, things are getting quite interesting. Bread making tournaments and practicing to become the best baker in Japan or better yet, the world. Baking never felt so fun and crazy like this. It isn't boring because puns are really well made, drama is also presented and facts about baking bread. Bread isn't only the things they're making here, other pastries as well. But you know, mostly bread. 
Aniplex is an animation studio in which it can be seen in different shows in the world of japanese animation. In this era,(---------) the art is awesome however because I am fond of watching HD anime shows, I'd give this one a -. It's good and it reminded me of the old times.  
The characters were spot-on. The only character that gave me a huge amount of annoyance is Mizuno. She was by-far the most unlikable person in this show. Both the voice and personality was stupid and uncomfortable. Even though Yukino was one of the main antagonist, I kinda liked her because she was funny. Azuma and the gang were cute people and awesome to watch but in the end, it was only Kazuma who took the highlight. Kanmuri, Kawachi and Suwabara remained in the sidelines. The guy with the mushroom head was really funny and he was always the one who always gets left behind. I even forgot his name. Tsukino isn't the kind of heroine who would be always be pitied on and become so annoying because she was always defenseless and does absolutely nothing but watch the boys go in competitions for her sake. Despite the fact, I wasn't annoyed by her and kept watching 'til the end.  
The openings and endings were not at all outstanding but I loved the first OP and ED the most. Both songs were happy and has unique tunes. The outstanding part about this show was the sound effect, call me weird but I actually hum to the sounds. If a sound effect from Yakitate!! was played in a place and I heard it, I would already know and be familiar that the sound was from this show. The voice actors did a spectacular job but Kazuma's voice wasn't suitable for me. In my opinion, he should have deeper and manly voice but after -- or so episodes I kind of get the hang of it. Mizuno's voice actor was annoying. She had a very high-pitched voice and it was also out of tune for some reason. She sounded like a broken jukebox or a scratched record or something. 
I had fun watching Yakitate!!. It was a unregretful experience in so many levels but just like other reviews they got tired of watching in the remaining - episodes or so. I agree to that; however when you try to see and get hooked, you will immediately want to know whether Kazuma will lose or win in every battle. But I have to  admit some jokes were repeated many times and it became boring to watch. For example, puns in every bread they would eat and the overreacting reactions with crossovers from other anime. The only thing that kept me alive was Kuroyanagi's reactions and Kawachi's catchphrase, ""Naniyatte?"" or in english ""What was that?!"" His voice and facial expression while saying that cracks me up everytime. Even though it was repetitive I can't stop reacting from it. Same goes for Kuro-yan. This was no doubt a unexplainable enjoyment. You will only know once you've watched it. 
To sum it all up, a unique but blunt story line plus a very memorable art plus a splendid music plus fun character development plus a undeniable enjoyment equals a great anime. The ending is just fine but it wasn't the ending that everyone would hope for. It was okay for me and people should be happy and try to watch this shounen anime.

Hi, this is my review for Kuroko no Basket. If you decide to vote ""Not Helpful"", please tell me why you did so on my profile as I always look to improve and please, read the review. 
Story: -/- Plot, -/- Development, Total -/-- 
Kuroko, now a junior high school student starts his semester Seirin High School, a team in it's -nd year. What the other players at Seirin soon find out is that he was a player on the legendary Teiko Middle School team, and was known as the ""phantom sixth man"". Along with Kagami Taiga, Kuroko decides to beat the ""Generation of Miracles"", Kuroko's old teammates which are all split up among schools around the area.  Reason why, is because Kuroko thinks they no longer know what it is to play basketball as a team. 
The story of Kuroko no Basket is not very exceptional, but it's also unique in a way that the main characters don't only seek to be the best, but to beat - specific people. As the story unfolds we have few sidesteps from the main story and most of it is predictable. However, the plot keeps you going since you always want to see Kuroko's other teammates and learn about them. 
I am a person that can continue watching shows even after they are spoiled for me, but if you really can't handle knowing most of what will happen in the next episode, you might want to skip this show. 
Art: -/- Art, -/- Animation, Total -/-- 
The art and animation is detailed and thoroughly done. The animators, drawers, whatever they're called making this animation and art have really outdone themselves. I mean, I really have nothing to complain about. However, when watching I noticed that some of the animation might've been missing some frames. 
Sound: -/- Voices, -/- OP/ED , -/- OST, Total -/-- 
I can't complain a lot about the voices except for a few unfitting ones on a few of the supporting characters, however these don't really matter and the voice actors for Kagami, Midorima and Kuroko I think are exceptional. 
The OP and ED of Kuroko no Basketball are definetly not lacking and work really well for introducing the episod eand ending it. Can't complain. 
Now for the OST, we have Gyakushuu, Kagami Taiga, Misdirection and ofcourse Sessen. If you haven't heard Sessen or missed it in the anime, then I beg you; seriously. Go listen to it. Right now. The OST collection this anime has is one of the best if not the best. Seriously. 
Character: -/- Design, -/- Development, Total -/-- 
The characters are kind of simple and clichè, but they got nice details to them and the fact that they represent a color of their own(Each have a color in their name) is really neat. Though the characters might seem clichè, I know the original mangaka put a lot of work into them. I can't see why people would dislike any of the characters for a bad design. The team is enjoyable to watch and even the simple talk is great, there's even more development further which makes me really like this show. 
Our two main characters and a description: 
Kuroko - strongwilled though silent, a bit of a smart type MC 
Kagami - probably more of a MC than Kuroko, eats a lot(cliché), musclehead 
And also, plot twist: The girl is the coach, not the manager! 
Throughout the anime we have nice development arcs and we have deep insight in what the characters feel and think. The characters are never left alone once in the spotlight and the anime does a good job at the development(for a shounen anime!). 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
I really enjoyed this anime, though I maybe liked the -nd season a bit more. There are neatly placed puns and jokes inbetween the serious matches and the anime is both full of action and full of great humour. 
Overall: -/-- 
-/-- for very good. It is a good anime to watch but it's not a must see though it gives sometimes a good laugh and sometimes scenes so serious you think you're playing basketball yourself. I recommend it to everyone with the random thought ""I should watch a sports anime""(the case for me). And if you've already watched it, you should watch ""Haikyuu!"" which probably is my favourite sports-and overall anime.

TL;DR - Hitsugi no Chaika is barely interesting enough to capture one's attention as the show is of the most basic the JRPG genre has to offer, but its lack of ecchi and any hugely problematic story elements make it a relatively decent time-waster and something to eat your dinner to if you have nothing better, but that's unfortunately what this anime amounts to - a waste of time. 
Hitsugi no Chaika is an adventure/supernatural anime centered around a girl named Chaika, daughter of the recently overthrown ruler of the world this anime inhabits. This anime takes place in a world I can only describe as a generic JRPG/fantasy world that contains magic, superpowers, and the like.  
I really don't have too much to say about this show considering the show itself is extremely simple and rather bland to say the least. The magic in this show is used by people who are ""wizards"" and who can harness their abilities into what is basically a magic rifle with magic bullets that shoot out spells. Initially the magic has an interesting appearance when spells are cast, but considering this anime uses the same generic animation that other anime with magic use and the same generic mosaic pattern with every spell, it gets very mundane very quickly.  
The main characters in this anime are comic relief in of themselves as their personalities are so flat and straightforward that this show seems to almost parody itself, creating the illusion that it doesn't take itself too seriously when in reality this show never really had much to offer. This show also lacks any persistent ecchi, but that's truly one of the few compliments I can give this show. The show instead mostly consists of girls in very revealing outfits, but rarely has any sexual plot points or anything that would truly label this an ""ecchi"". Hell it might've even given this show a better reason for existing, but perhaps the world doesn't need another meaningless ecchi in an already growing haystack of ecchi in the anime world.  
Overall this show doesn't offer much besides some mild amusement. The world is incredibly generic and the story doesn't leave much to be desired, but this show has relatively good pacing, is unoffensive in its very basic ideas of both morality and justice, and is a steady adventure anime to eat your dinner to if you don't have anything else to watch.

This show, in my opinion, took way too long to kick into gear. Throughout the first half of the show, I spent more time wondering where this show was going than actually focusing on the show. The story takes too long to progress for you to even enjoy the show in the first place. In all honesty, I was somewhat hooked when shit hit the fan. This anime wasn't entirely all that bad. 
Story - - 
I had no sense of what the story even was until things started getting explained. The problem with this show was that hardly anything was explained EVER. The only thing I got from the first few episodes is that there's this dude who really likes stars and CHIKUSHOOOOO his childhood friend is dead and NANIIIII???? we're suddenly back at the start with a new white-haired girl. Even after the appearance of Yui, I still wasn't understanding what was happening.  
Art - - 
Meh. Nothing special. Pretty boring to look at honestly. It did have a few moments. --/-- for the freaky black box though.  
Sound - - 
The sound in this show had no effect on me whatsoever. OST wasn't anything special either. I felt nothing from the music. OP was decent. 
Character - - 
I LOVE YUI. She's was great, but she still can't make up for all of what the other character's lack. I HATE KAORI. Her voice actor, imo, was too high-pitched. Also, I just felt that Kaori was nothing but selfish the entire duration of the series. Kenny, funny guy, nothing cool about him though. Nagisa was going SOMEWHERE with the whole arranged marriage thing but then it was totally DROPPED. Airi, poor girl never even had a chance with Sou. Sou-kun, I don't think he was a strong enough lead. 
Enjoyment - - 
First half of the series was bleh, but again, once it got going, I was intrigued. Still, this show was pretty hard to get through. 
Overall - - 
I believe this show COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING GREAT. But sadly, it isn't.

(doing this review mainly to make up for the removal of another one that i did) 
holy shit this is a crazy show whit a shit ton of stuff going on  
in fact it is the only show where a shit ton of stuff is going on but theoretically nothing is ever actually happening. the show has an interesting empathises on nothing. nothing dandy and the crew do is ever important to anyone but them. and often it is nothing more than a mundane task that the character wants to complete that then stems for the rest of the story. 
this show fucks with the timeline quite a bit and i think that the lack of real over arching story makes this work. with no real need to be relegated to one universe this show takes every chance to be complete of the walls crazy. like putting a battery in a microwave and hoping to find the cure for cancer. it won't work but the road to getting there is a fun and exciting experience. even if the only reason for that is the fact that the actual outcome could be so far from the desired on that it almost feels like the story writers where writhing this show using trial and error. 
this show is criticised for having no plot or barley explaining the paper thin explanation for a plot we are given but i argue that (spoilers) dandy is the god of the universe or whatever and he just wants to expel story for a good meal at boobies.

""These are a few of my favorite things!"" 
Sakamichi No Apollon delivered in the enjoyment category no doubt. That late ----'s vibe, combined with the animation and music of the show, and lively characters..all of it was simple, yet effective and satisfying. Sentaro was my go-to watch character in the series, just because his story and appearance, and his attitude, and he was christian. Richie and him went great together in the whole series, it felt..right and necessary having them around each other, because the anime felt interesting whenever they would meet up. Just those two making music, filled KOTS duties on music. Of course let's not forget the other musicians.  
The other characters weren't too important aside from Ritsu. Junichi's scenes and involvement were good, but really...man all I wanted to see is if when am I going to see more jazz being made! Richie and Sentaro, without them getting screen time together the show would be probably bad! Those two characters go hand-in-hand, because they created lots of entertainment for me. The last episode..oh man it was fantastic, a great ending indeed (you won't be disappointed!) 
As for the rest of the story, some parts feel extremely rushed..and those specific parts I felt would've been essential to make the story more interesting and to get to know the characters way more. The story isn't special at all aside from the heart-warming and tear-jerking ending. I never understood Richie, he was so surprising and so interesting in the beginning of the series, however later on, he gets confusing. I never got to know much about him aside from his few interests. Again, this story is laughable and probably mediocre, simple but nothing much to talk about, although the ending justified it for me. 
As for music..I went ahead and downloaded the ost. You will most likely be to do so as well if your into Yoko Kanno's stuff. I watched the OP every episode. Special effects were close to none at all including atmospheric effects, car noises, birds chirping, wind blowing, none of that organic stuff. Voice acting was good, I liked it alot! Background music fitted in so well with so many of the scenes as I could remember, some of them were really feel-good and just nice to have an ear on! 
I'll end this review here. I want to recommend you to watch this anime, even though there's a tiny chance you won't like it..but it's only -- episodes of music, drama, and romance. ALso, I just wanna say this anime made me cry like buckets. Just do yourself a favor and watch Sakamichi No Apollon, it won't hurt. If you like enlightening and heart-warming stuff, watch this anime! 
Thanks for reading! 
May grace and peace be with you, and God bless you. :)

When i watched the first episode of Dusk maiden x amnesia, i was confused of the beginning... i mean first they all know eachother but later during first episode he meets the club members, it's confusing in like - hours but then you get it. 
The characters are really interesting, and it's most aroun Teiichi and Yuuko but that's good, i just wished the others were more on the screen, the first episodes are most introductions of the characters like most animes. It's plenty of ecchi moments in it and also humor at some moments, and some episoes may cause confusions or something like that but you'll understand after some minutes or hours ^_^ the story's really good but on minus are that they showed the ending of the serie at the beginning of episode - which was a huge mistake i think, if they hadn't done that the ending would be alot more better. 
The art are really good and i gave it --, the sound are brilliant and the soundtracks are masterpieces, i've found a liking of the intro ""Choir jail"" which is also played at the end of episode --. Characters are good, i gave it - because of Yuukos perrsonality, i'm not gonna spoil anything but i didn't like the part with the shadow thing and that, and where she suddenly changed from airhead to ""something else"" enjoyment is on - because it's alot of ecchi (which is minus for me) otherwise it's good, the last episode's ending are quite similar to alot of other animes, for example Clannad after story's one example, for some reason when i watched the endingof episode -- Tasogare otome x amnesia i got the Clannad After story ending in mind.  
Overall i gave it -, This anime's a both girls and boys anime and i recommend it  to people who like Romance and at sametime ghosts and old tales.

Code Geass is a Mecha anime, with lots of drama, fighting, and disagreements. The story starts out as an almost day-to-day life of a school student until he gets caught up in a rebellion against Britannia. I loved the story line, and how there were plenty of twists in it to make the series more addicting. The way that everything was played out was outstanding. The story was just amazing. As was the art. Everything looked so realistic. The robots were amazing. To me, it seems like the art was perfected to every last bolt. The sound was good, but there were re-occurring sounds in some of the episodes that got a little annoying. Besides that, I loved all the background music, all the opening themes, and all the ending themes. The characters all had very different personalities. Most of the characters also seemed to have the thing with 'acting like someone else' when they're around their friends. I enjoyed this show so much. I wish that the ending wasn't so.. Sudden. Everything has it's own way of doing things, and personally, I liked this anime a lot. Overall, it deserves --/--.

This is my ---th review for MAL! Before I start this review, I want to thank all my MAL friends and everyone who has ever said that they enjoyed one of my reviews, as well as those that gave me the constructive criticism I needed to become a better reviewer and a better writer in general. 
Overview 
Today I will be looking at one of the most critically acclaimed, lauded anime of the last -- years. Berserk is difficult to review because so many critics that are far more articulate than I am have already looked at it. What can I possibly say that hasn't been said before? Probably not much, but I will try anyways. Fun fact: the words Berserker and Berserk come from the Norwegian poem Hrafnsmál, written by the Viking poet Þorbjörn Hornklofi in the ---s AD.  
Oh and spoilers!!! Is it even possible someone hasn't seen Berserk?! 
Story: --/-- 
Before I dive into the story, I must first explain some background history. Berserk wasn't just another dark and moody medieval fantasy, it was in many ways rather revolutionary for fantasy as a genre! The Berserk manga came out during a time when much of fantasy was still trying to closely emulate Tolkien and Lewis. There were some darker fantasy authors like Zalazny that revelled in sinister schemes and dirty politics, but even he wasn't THAT dark in the end. In these fantasy novels there was good vs. evil and good always won in the end. There were evil men, but Mankind was unquestionably good as a whole. Berserk started as a manga in ----, a full - years before the first Game of Thrones novel was released and made dark fantasy the norm, completely changing how the West writes fantasy novels. Berserk was a trend setter and a series with some serious balls! 
Berserk is the tale of a badass, ruthless mercenary named Guts who wields a giant sword and slaughters everyone with his unstoppable rage and fury. The title Berserk is a reference to the medieval Berserkers on whom Guts was based. Guts was found under a corpse hanging from a tree and was brought up as a child soldier by a complete douchebag named Gambino! Gambino not only abuses Guts and forces him to fight to the death at age -, he even sells Guts for a night to a Moorish warrior, who brutally rapes him. Fortunately, Guts later commits patricide and lives out -/- of the Freudian dream. Guts later joins a mercenary band called the Hawks after losing a duel to its fabulously gay leader Griffith. The Hawks do very well as a group and kick some serious ass before many are slaughtered fighting a giant demon that calls itself Zodd the Immortal! Zodd is one of the most badass characters in the history of anime. He gets his arm cut off and beats the shit out of Griffith with his own severed arm, as a sort of reverse Beowulf. Zodd is about to kill Guts and Griffith, but he notices Griffith's weird and freaky necklace and mysteriously buggers off. After the Hawks win the war that had been raging for --- years, there is a fallout between Guts and Griffith and Guts leaves the Hawks. This really effects Griffith, who is heavily hinted to have romantic feelings for Guts. Griffith decides to channel his rage into banging the princess for no reason, even though this is a horrible idea and completely out of character for the cold, calculating Griffith. However, the writer needed the plot to advance. Griffith is captured by the king's guards, tortured, and kept in a dungeon for a year before the rest of the Hawks find Guts and get him to help them rescue Griffith. At first Griffith contemplates living life as a cripple with Casca looking after him, but he decides instead to use his magic necklace to summon - Arch-Demons and sacrifice all of his loyal followers in order to become the -th Arch Demon and form the final “finger of the God Hand”. Griffith does this because…if you haven’t figured it out yet Griffith is a HUGE asshole! Griffith even celebrates the occasion by raping Casca in front of Guts while demons hold him down, simply because he knows Guts loves Casca and that would piss him off. The anime ends with a massive “fuck you” ending to the audience and fades to black with Guts screaming in agony. In the manga it explains how Guts and Casca escape Deus Ex Machina style with the help of the “Skull Knight” whom the author uses shamelessly whenever he has written himself into a corner.  
Honestly, I felt the manga really goes downhill and becomes increasingly generic as the mangaka seems to give less of a shit every year. It has been going on for -- years now and the chances of it ending with a satisfactory conclusion are virtually zero. The Eclipse ending at least completes Griffith’s transformation to evil and ends as a strong parable for the corrupting effects of power. Although the Godfather did this a bit better in my opinion because Michael started out likeable and wanted to NOT go into the family business. Griffith ALWAYS wanted to rule the world and was a complete sociopath from the time we met him. In a flashback from Casca, we are shown that at one time he cared about his men and was even willing to sell himself sexually to an old man in order to get war funds rather than risk his men in raids. However, apart from this one flashback in a single episode, Griffith is basically a complete douchebag and this lessens the impact that his turn to evil has on the audience. 
Characters: -/-- 
The characters in Berserk are quite memorable and like the plot were HIGHLY influential on anime that followed. Let’s look at Guts character. He is an ex- child soldier with a highly abusive father figure that hates him because he blames Guts for the death of his wife and eventually tries to kill Guts. The impact of his own father trying to kill him makes Guts steel his heart to the point that he is physically repulsed by human contact. As stated by Griffith, “Guts kills simply to confirm his own existence and test the strength of his will”. All of these traits and the EXACT SAME backstory were used in Naruto for the character Gaara! Guts’ giant sword was also the main inspiration for Cloud’s giant sword in Final Fantasy -. Griffith is one of the most famous anime antagonists of all time! He is up there with Char, Johan, Light, and a short list of legendary anime bad guys that everyone has at least heard of. Casca was a fairly strong female role that didn’t conform to anime stereotypes and was pretty badass. That is until after getting raped she loses her memory and becomes Nyuu from Elfen Lied, only worse. However, that is just the manga and I am reviewing the anime today. Other supporting characters include everyone’s favorite Judo, Pippin the strong man, and Corkas who is the comic relief asshole because this series really needed more assholes! Also Sir Adon was already the comic relief asshole, so I am really unsure why Corkas needed to exist. Overall, a strong and memorable character cast. 
Art: -/-- 
The art in Berserk is at least better than the god awful CGI in the first movie, but it is still honestly quite poor. The use of still frames and recycled animation is worse than DBZ and Berserk was made in ---- with a decent budget and only -- episodes. Eva was made - years earlier than Berserk and had WAY better animation…except for the last - episodes that is. At least the character designs for the main characters are solid, although extras tend to all have the same face. 
Music: -/-- 
A lot of people really like the Berserk OST, but unfortunately I am not one of them! I thought it was rather mediocre for the most part. It doesn’t have a lot of diversity and uses the same decent quality pieces over and over again like the track “Behilit”, which is played more often than “Rocky Top” at a UT Volunteers game! 
Entertainment: -/-- 
Parts of the show are truly entertaining, while other sections can get a little slow in my opinion. Also the extremely pessimistic outlook of the series can get quite wearisome. There is a reason that most stories offer if not a happy ending, at least some kind of hope or bittersweet. Berserk is like a Greek Tragedy of old and this can be fairly hard to write. As mentioned before, the author really should have not done the present day stuff, scrapped Puck, and just had the Golden Age arc as a modern day Greek tragedy. That would have done much better in preserving the series artistic integrity and legacy in anime history. 
Overall: -/--: (--+-- +-+-+-)/- = -.- rounding to - 
Many prominent anime critics including JesuOtaku and Bennet the Sage consider Berserk to be the single greatest anime of all time. I…am not one of those that think that. I highly respect Berserk and think it is a very good series, but it has some flaws and I can’t really consider it the greatest ever. In addition, Berserk doesn’t quite “hit the spot” for me as far as my personal tastes go. Overall though, I would HIGHLY recommend watching this series.

Such a horrible fate One piece has to find himself being produced by Toei Animation studios.  
There is no doubt that one piece is awesome if we talk about the story. The universe is attracting, characters are lovable and it follows a certain logic that fit perfectly the shounen manga world, from this point of view you will definitly have a hard time finding a manga with such big and coherant world and at the same time light-hearted. So story -/--.  
[IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH ONE PIECE PASS ONTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT HINT ABOUT THE STORY] 
The only problem that i could spot in the story is the recent developpement of 
Sanji,Usopp and Brook. The author has quite ignored sanji and brook, and make usopp a good for nothing, succeeding in enormous proportions because of his luck and not his will to become a great pirate. And that sacrifice of the character only for some gags that are not funny is in my point of view very absurd. If we were - Years in the past and you were telling me Usopp's storyline from the dressrosa Arc, i'm not sure if i would want to talk with you again...   
For the character developpement, i'm sadened that the author of the pillar of the shounen world (so children story) actually has the systematic tendency to over-sexualise the body of the women in his story. The binary vision of the pretty women with big boobs and a perfect waist in the opposite of the ugly women is really disturbing and can opress the lector. Because of these two point i gave -/-- note for Characters. 
Soundtrack is awesome and voice characters too so : -/--. 
When in the vast majority of anime adaptations the anime make the story even more interesting and pretty. One piece is the exact inverse case. From static plans being abused to bad drawings, bad and awfully long animations and a pacing utterly slow, the dynamics of fights is impacted negatively.  
It's because the studio has make the awfull choice to animate one chapter per episode, have you seen in an anime a character yelling - times in the same scene his attack's name, then you haven't seen one piece anime.  
Some scene are very far from being honest with the manga. So i put -/-- for the Art.  
Overall, don't lose your time watching one piece anime, buy the books you'll definitly enjoy better the story. I put -/-- Overall because i think -/-- for this anime is defintely too much, i would put -/--, but my opinion is that this anime does not represent the manga correctly. It's not for nothing that a project named ""One pace"" (Removing all sort of bad scene) exist for this series.

Compared to the first season of IS: Infinite Stratos, the second season feels very similar. Just like the first season, the mecha theme is brought back, along with the harem, the ecchiness, the gag. In simpler words, it doesn't feel like anything has changed.  
Like other harem animes, IS: Infinite Stratos - brings a cast of girls chasing one guy, but the difference is that the setting is in a girls-only school with the protagonist, Ichika, the sole male in the school. Judging it as a harem anime, sure, this is a pretty smart idea. However, since both the characters and the story are ridiculously weak, the anime as a whole simply cannot be taken seriously, similar to many other harem animes. We have the prototypical protagonist boy whose strong male presence (considering he is the only male in the school) attracts a whole lot of girls, but he is oblivious towards their feelings. We have two types of girls in the school: the first type is the type that falls in love with him for no reason at all, and the second type is the type that falls in love with him because he promised to protect them. Basically, the characters are very one-dimensional, sounds very similar to the first season, right? Charlotte is the only girl who has an enjoyable and understandable character, which is why she is also the best character across both seasons. The story is a minor improvement from the first season, since at least a few episodes have antagonists in them (the Phantom Task), but it is still very poor, as the story is full of holes and a very important antagonist gets introduced out of nowhere, which leaves me wondering many many times, ""Who the **** is that? Why the **** is she not introduced in the first season? What the **** is wrong with this storyline???"" 
Other minor aspects are just OK. Art is what you would typically expect in a mecha anime. The ISs look pretty good, characters are like any other anime characters, animations are average, nothing to ""Wow"" about. Sound is also average, but it does its job to fit in with the anime. You're not going to hear any sound that's going to make you cry or fire you up.  
Among all these negative aspects of this anime, the one shining star is: it draws cheap laughs out of you. This anime isn't going to leave a lasting impression like Steins;Gate does or Gintama does, this anime isn't going to give you an anime hero that you will think about for the next week like Death Note does or One Piece does. The most you should expect is laughing at silly, ecchi scenes with tsundere girls. Bored? Want a break from your routine? Want to laugh at stupid things and drool over breasts? This is it, this anime is for you.

This is an anime series with more than ---+ episodes and the name of the anime is totally unimportant and irrelevant to the story.  
Story : This anime has no plot by any means, simply an unending stream of battles with no point, hung together with adversaries getting a adjustment in appearance in every new battle. The battles are as faltering as they can get : An arbitrary character will be running and another person will show up in their path for reasons unknown. At that point it will cut into a flashback demonstrating that they were companions like -- years back. At that point they will talk for -- minutes and afterward begin battling. They'll battle for like...- scenes? At that point they will claim to have been holding back and going easy and then the two character will start shouting and yelling at each other.  
The fundamental character, Ichigo Kurosaki transforms into a reptile. Wtf?  
The art is great.  
Sound is decent.  
-/-- Overall.  
Enjoyment..well, if that is your thing then you'll like it.

I'm a bit late with this anime but when I watched it the first thing I say ""Is this based on VN(Visual Novel) or Novel?"" because it just too good to be true. Then, I did some research and found out the writer of Plastic Memories the same as the writer of Steins;Gate, yeah, that Steins;Gate. ""yep that's why"" 
Overall it is an amazing anime, one of anime that makes me cry along with AnoHana and Angel Beats. The art is nice, the sound actor is great, my favorite character is Michiru 
I really love if the make a second season but that might be a bit too much to ask, a movie maybe, about the main hero try to fight like the one in Ushinawareta Mirai

*Spoilers for Char’s Counterattack* 
A harrowing tale of love, betrayal, grudges, death, and faith, an epic battle to save the world, and a final battle to settle one of fiction’s greatest rivalries and conclude an epic saga that has spanned an entire decade. This is final chapter! This is Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack! 
Much like Char’s plans themselves, this movie didn't quite pan out as intended. Instead of the gripping and somber finale to an iconic rivalry, the film is more of an exhibition of how stupid people can be and how a lack of foresight can damage a saga, film, and finale. The epic conclusion to this legendary and awkwardly managed saga somehow doesn't utilize the saga's canon very well, resulting in a misfire as tragic as its characters' fates. Let's find out how, shall we? 
---- Universal Century Calendar. A plan has been initiated to drop Axis onto Earth by none other than Char himself. Why Char is doing this is beyond me thanks to the fact that not only was he never remotely like this, but there was no progression from any Gundam series to this point. Either way, this has gotten the Earth Federation panicking, especially since whenever they try treaties, he backstabs the hell out of them and blows whatever forces are near him to kingdom come. None take it worse than Amuro Ray, the ultimate rival of Char, and thus, the rivalry begins again. Sounds like an interesting premise, don't it? If you made it so that Char’s plan is in line with his typical actions and how he is as a person (since they aren't), this would be totally kickass. That said, you'd also have to give a good justification for why he went back to being an awful person considering how he was in Zeta Gundam. On top of that, you'd need to justify why these two would butt heads again, and the film's attempts at this aren't very compelling. Already, this film fundamentally fails. 
Speaking of reasons this film fundamentally fails, we get the introduction of - characters: Gyunei, Hathaway, and Quess. I'll talk about how fucking retarded these pieces of shit are later, but let’s just say that their stupidity and actions are very...intrusive, to put it kindly. Two of them are the subject of bad heel turns and all of them have terrible romantic aspiration subplots that start up for no legitimate reason, and the amount of time spent on them simply bogs down the movie. They're not the only ones with romance subplots however since not only has Astionage gotten himself a girlfriend named Kayra, and Amuro and Chan have banter before sharing a kiss in the middle of the movie. Both go nowhere but I have to ask: did something happen between Amuro and Beltorika? They aren't in ZZ, and we never see that they split in either this or Zeta Gundam, so what happened between them that Amuro is now single and ready to kiss a girl? This movie doesn't say anything, making this subplot rather badly written in terms of implications. For Astionage and Kayra, he wants to cook her a pasta but in battle she dies, causing her to mourn over her corpse about the pasta he earned to make for her. Honestly, it would've been more impactful if we see him making pasta before the news got to him. Regardless, let's move on. 
Even with all that, there aren't many plot holes or many other inconsistencies in the film, but then we get the Axis drop and Amuro’s attempt to stop it...along with a team of mobile suits from the Federation’s --th fleet outta nowhere just to try and make a deus ex machina, which initially seems to fail but then, out of nowhere, Amuro’s Nu Gundam starts shooting our green particles after a morality sparring match with Char and this is enough to get Axis off course and deflect it entirely, with the fate of our two rivals left unknown, and then the movie abruptly ends after this deus ex machina. I don't need to explain how bad this writing is, right? I mean, it doesn't kill the movie, hell, the plot wasn't all that great to begin with thanks to bad character subplots and decisions but this was just the final nail in the coffin. At least, it would be, but the final nail actually turned out to be how this film doesn't have any stable chronology with the previous installments, as nothing built up to this. To be fair, given how not much left over from Zeta properly carried over to ZZ, it's no surprise the same happened here. What is surprising is that where ZZ resorted to retcons, this one is disconnected from ZZ almost entirely. The only thing connecting them together is a throwaway line about the failures of the main antagonist from ZZ who made her debut in the final stretch of Zeta Gundam. As if this film needed more reasons why it just doesn't work on a basic level. 
For the returning case, luckily Noa and Amuro are basically kept intact, even despite how agitated they are in this crazy new crisis. Char meanwhile...let’s say that his biggest flaw is the extremes of this new plan since this is basically the product of progression that we never got to see since he was never remotely thinking of this kind of action in Zeta or the original Gundam, so what happened that made him truly hate humanity so much? Aside from that and how decidedly uncharismatic he is now given his main antagonist status, he’s kept intact as well. We never cared about Astionage, and Mirai is barely even present throughout this movie.  
Now to what really tanked here: the new characters. Let's start with one of the most hated characters in Gundam history, Quess! Aside from being an emotionally manipulative bitch, she, for no reason, tries to stake claim for both Amuro and Char and hated people close to them for “getting in her way” and really shows what a spoiled brat she is. The fact that she becomes to willing to kill anyone and everyone makes it worse since she’s already a flip-flop character, an inconsistent pancake that just flips and flops all the time because she’s a selfish and manipulative whore that has nothing else concrete about her! Gyunei initially to want to study her as a way of improving himself as a Cyber Newtype but then, out of nowhere, he falls head over heels for her and is ready to do whatever it takes to destroy Char to win her over. Why he would fall for a ---year-old when he is seemingly a lot older is beyond me by it just happens abruptly without any reason as to why. The jackass doesn't even get to die properly because we never actually see him die outside of his mech getting blown up. You'd think for such a notable character for the film they'd at least show him in the process of dying.  
I'm aware that Hathaway isn't actually exclusive to CCA, but like Katz, we only get to see him do things and have a personality that affects a narrative in his somewhat grown-up appearance, which is here in this case. For the most part, he seems like a decent kid, even though he falls for Quess. However, late into the movie, he loves her so much (for no real reason other than they went on a date, we don't even see him having a crush on her beforehand) that after Chan kills her to save his life, he outright blasts her to death. Is the main message of the movie supposed to be that love makes you stupid? If so, there are better ways and settings to show that message without having such badly written as intrusive characters on display, and all of these guys have ample screen time and relevance to major scenes in the movie, just to make matters worse. Anyone else in this film is one-dimensional and basically worthless to the narrative other than Nanai (who is only really notable to me for delivering a deliciously satisfying slap to that bitch Quess) that I'm not gonna waste any more time dissecting this overall pretty terrible cast of characters. 
Studio Sunrise and Studio Hirabi to make this film, and if nothing else, the film looks gorgeous. The action and mech animation shows off the best of what the --’s were capable of, with such crisp and smooth animation and detail with every bit of action and movement, making the battles brilliant to look at. The Nu Gundam and the Sazabi have particularly great mobile suit designs and all of the other new mechs look pretty neat too. The almost angel dust-like sparks coming from every shot fired from a blaster rifle and every explosion make this film just majestic to bask in when it comes to seeing the fight scenes, and the character animations and designs look great as ever. The only gripe I have is in one of the colonies having egregiously dated CGI that also fucks over its frame rate. I never knew that was possible in the --’s and it was a disconcerting experience to be sure, though it hardly takes anything away from the glorious visuals of the film. Honestly, the visuals are so good that some viewers might just be able to brush the writing aside and enjoy it as an action spectacle. That's all this film is good for, honestly. 
Sadly, almost none of the tracks in this film are memorable, which is a real disappointment, especially considering how good Zeta's soundtrack was. There is only one track from one of the earlier scenes that sounds pretty good and I wish there were more pieces here that sounded actually cinematic and memorable. None of it is bad music but nothing sticks, not even the ED. It's not the worst soundtrack in this timeline, but not one of the better ones. The dub is also rather meh, barring Brad Swaile’s great returning performance as Amuro and Michael Kopsa as Char Aznable, who despite a few weak moments, sounds pretty good and has a really booming political speech at the midway point. Everyone else is rather so-so, some being worse than others but even then, the dub never sounds overall bad, but these two basically saved the dub from absolute mediocrity. 
Like with some of the worst anime Gundam installments out there, good mech action isn't enough to make a good Gundam series. If an action show or movie wants to have a story as its focus, the story it tries to tell actually has to make sense and the drama has to work without being an intrusion on the product and our enjoyment of it. Unfortunately, Char's Counterattack fails at all of this, so you either enjoy it as a spectacle, or you get a headache out of frustration. Despite trying to cap off one of the most monumental sagas and rivalries in the industry, the film can't justify its own existence. The more Studio Sunrise uses this film's events as a lynchpin for dodgy future titles, the more headache-inducing these failures become. There's a reason I say this timeline dies with the end of Zeta Gundam.

I can honestly say that I've never been so happy to be done with a series. This show is barely watchable, and it all stems from the main character. 
The Worst Person In The Entire World 
At first, I thought I'd really enjoy the show. The first --- episodes or so have a unique feel with some decent comedy and interesting characters, but then it takes a turn that it never recovers from. The main character, Sato, is a twenty-something-year-old version of your boiler plate Shinji character, but it doesn't seem that way at first. Don't be fooled; once he starts exhibiting the cliche weak, hesitant, self-centered, clueless characteristics we find in way too many anime, you will loathe him for the remainder of the show. 
Sato is not a NEET; he's not an hikikomori; he's not otaku; he's just an awful person. Clearly the author believes he's an hikikomori since they need to say that on average - times an episode, but throughout the show you will see him constantly switch in and out of being perfectly fine in society and completely scared. You could argue that the switch coincides with how is life is going, but the polarity between the two states is jarring and completely unconvincing. Additionally, even though he's supposed to be a shut-in of - years, he has no hobbies that would indicate he's done anything except stare at a wall for that time. He's not otaku, he doesn't play online games, and he isn't even aware that you can search for porn on the Internet. 
What makes the show completely unbearable to watch is how entirely self-centered he is. Unlike him, all of the supporting characters have had real hard-ships (some much harder than others). While he remains completely inward-focused, he never asks his friends about their problems or tries to understand what they are going through. This is a man who even raises his fist multiple times to the one person who is ---% unconditionally supportive and caring to him; even when she's in complete tears, he says nothing to her. Instead, he goes home to contemplate how he is affected by what she was saying. Not even a thought about her or what kind of pain she was going through. 
The Saving Angel 
Aside from the main character, the supporting characters are actually quite interesting. Most prominently, Misaki, is a beautiful person who by far has been through the worst of it. In all honesty, this show could've been terrific if she was the main character. If it weren't because I wanted to see how her story unfolded, there is no way I could've made it all the way to the end. 
Story 
Characters aside, the story had a few problems as well. The biggest problem is that the series takes a few random deviations (kind of like mini-arcs) that are incredibly far outside the realm of the main plot. Including an in-world MMO subplot that lasts a few episodes. They were too distracting, not to mention boring. There were also some major consistency issues as it pertains to the passage of time and the balance of money. You could say these are small details, but the passage of time was to the degree that at one moment the implication was that a month had passed and then just a few minutes later that only a few days had passed. 
The story is also way too long; it could've and should've ended at episode --. It even has a great climactic feel to it, but for some reason another -- episodes of misery await. 
Art 
I love the way the characters are drawn in this series. The art is without a doubt the best aspect of the show. The only thing that was bizarre is that Misaki was the only character that wore the same t-shirt and skirt throughout the entire show. Every other character had different outfits, but even though she actually had a job, she apparently had no wardrobe. There's one part of the show that could imply this was intentional, but I'll avoid a potential spoiler by dismissing it. 
Comedy 
The beginning of the show has some funny parts; after that, there's less than a handful of parts to get a chuckle out of. You can see where they were trying to be funny, but it falls flat. 
Execution 
The visuals and environment are quite nice, and the music is enjoyable too. The voice acting is really well done, and the subs (watched on funimation) were also good. In terms of execution, the show was done quite well. 
Final Thought 
I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who doesn't want to be on the verge of tossing a perfectly good screen out the window. The amount of frustration that comes from watching Sato continuously portray the type of person who does nothing but completely absorb himself in his own misery had me throwing double-birds at my screen over and over again. Do not start this show because you will probably get sucked into something that seems pretty good until around episode -.

Though the series has barely just begun, I really enjoyed the first season of Yuru Yuri. The story was just random, making it comical for the viewers unlike other anime where there are always problems. It shows the daily lives of regular middle school girls with some funny situations. I must say that the art is indeed better than most other anime in my opinion and the sound makes it sound cute. Each character has their own personalities, making everyone different. Akarin, for example, is a bit withdrawn but tries to stand out and does her best, making the best out of her day. Kyoko is very outgoing and energetic. She makes the group's lives an adventure everyday. Meanwhile, Yui would be the mature type of the group to make sure that they stay out of trouble, mostly referring to Kyoko. Chinatsu is like the extra glue that would tie the entire group together, making even more funny situations with her imaginations of her and Yui. Yuru Yuri is really funny and overall, I think it deserves a perfect --.

No, but in all seriousness, I found myself literally wracked with anxiety pulling for the characters, hoping with all my heart for the desired ending. It ends up being contrived, but that's OK; I don't think my heart could have taken it any other way. 
The OST fits the movie beautifully, and the landscapes and animation are top notch. Haven't seen an anime that looks this good in a while. 
Character development isn't the strongest in existence as it felt like it was based on some certain tropes, but the experiences feel genuine and the body switching was a delightful choice that added a new layer of depth to the story. 
I haven't had an anime that's gotten me this close to tears in a while, and that's a damn good indicator of how good this movie is.

When this anime was first released out in ----, I wasn't immediately hooked into this series until late ---- after finding out how high this show's popularity was. So, I just took a shot at watching this anime to see how well it displayed. 
Story: - 
To begin with, I've read the summary for this anime a lot of times and one day when I reread it again, I didn't think it would really center a lot around ""memories"" and I certainly didn't expect that would be so important in the plot. So I thought that this anime was going to be another boring Slice of Life anime. 
But I was wrong, and I wasn't just wrong in how well it displayed in the first few episodes. Episode one started off normally like any other anime and the fact that it was a college setting made it a bit interesting as I've been sick of watching high school characters (they tend to be annoying, especially with how they are portrayed). 
The main character's amnesia, I thought it was only a portion of the anime and that it won't be brought up again (thought it was just a filler for his background story), but after around episode -, I realize that this anime may just leave me wondering how the choices the MC makes counterargue with me and the rest of this anime. 
I can agree with others in that the story was interesting because I've never seen any other anime with this kind of plot. Sure, amnesia has been around a few animes, but this one involved with his past conflicting with his current self, which leaves me with questions about amnesia and whether someone should really try to go back to their past self. 
The Romance genre has never been good with me because after a while, I just drop the series because there's nothing left to tell after the MC just gets together with the other person. Since the plot centered around this fast-paced and out of the blue romance relationship between the two MCs, I thought that there was literally no character development at all, it didn't appeal to me and worst of all, that's not how real life works (yes, this is anime world so I don't blame the author). 
Art: - 
Nothing wrong with the series's art, but sometimes I feel really angry when seeing the two MCs face, comparing with their personalities. The other characters and their design with the art looks unique but they kind of dull in with every moment the anime goes on. 
Sound: - 
I probably shouldn't rate sound a - because I didn't even turn my volume on when I watched this anime. I never saw and heard the opening song and ending song, and I've, of course, didn't get to hear any background music. I didn't hear any sound and was fine with it, but I could almost imagine their voices, and the voice actors were fine, nothing wrong with them. 
But to be fair, even if I didn't hear the music, I won't rate it a -- because that's unlogic. All I can say is that art and sound were about the same. 
Characters: - 
Trust me, there really are characters that are immediately unlikable and not even worth mentioning, and I'm sorry to put this, but about --% of MCs just don't go along with my head and this may only just be my opinion. 
The main character acts like a goody-two-shoes and a nice guy that seems to have his way of talking to the main character girl easily in the first few episodes and it just centers around them too much, there's no space for other characters to get close with the MC girl. 
Tada Banri - The MC wasn't unlikable in the first start, but after his problem with amnesia reappears, I just couldn't take it anymore. His conversations and attitude with Koko was very annoying and knowing that they were meant to be the main couple, I actually didn't want him to be with anyone in the end, aside from Linda after knowing who she was. The only thing I like about him was his past, maybe I should say that his ghost was one of the characters I like. 
Kaga Koko - She was annoying but I didn't despise her in the first place (it shocks me that I actually felt bad for her in the first place when it's her fault for being a stalker and obsessive/weirdish kid). The cover of the anime mainly showed her and I already didn't want to know anything about her and she looked like the only one who's capable of wearing other clothes, whereas the rest were plain and nowhere to be found. She even looked more adult than the rest (but her personality is worse than that of an adult) and I thought it was a story of an older woman with a younger man after her first appearance in episode one. 
The way she says ""love"" makes me think that the author didn't put enough effort in her. It felt as if she was a person who was very hard to avoid and disappear in someone's life (with what happened to Mitsuo) and then all of a sudden, someone totally capable of giving up love for him and then falling in love with another person. It really bothered me with why the MC chose to go out with someone like that instead of someone who was interesting, like Linda. 
Linda - the first time she came out, I was thinking ""Oh, another character that will not get together with the MC"". But after knowing her past with Banri, I really started liking this character and hoped for the MC to get his mind and head straight and leave someone like Koko. His thoughts about amnesia made me hate the MC because if I had amnesia, I wouldn't want to lose my identity and start over with no one to know (of course, this is just my opinion). 
Mitsuo, Oka Chinami, -D-kun - characters who are just like placeholders for ""friends"". -D-kun was suddenly part of the group and only served for a few lines and his personality began to contradict with his name and it didn't make any sense to even have him with just a few information about his likes and his name. Oka Chinami was a likable character at first and after Mitsuo started to take an interest on her, I thought they would have some character relationship development, but no, there was not. Mitsuo just started to take a liking to another person and then Oka realizes this and starts to feel for him without any mentioning of how or any way of distributing this information in the viewer's eyes. It's always about the MCs and not them, these characters' stories get nowhere and no result except that we know the MCs are the ones who get together. 
Enjoyment: - 
To be honest, I actually enjoyed the series because of the plot. I enjoyed some of the characters even though they only have a little of screen time. When once the idea of amnesia awakes in an episode, it makes me want to know more only to know that the MC will have to have some time with Koko for a progressive romance, and it felt like the anime doesn't really cover that until the last episode. And the last episode wasn't enjoyable because of Linda's reply and it felt rushed and we never get to know whether she meant it or not, so how could Banri's ghost just be satisfied with just that answer? The MC returns with amnesia and amnesia can be like this, but I don't think he can just turn back and turn new and realize what is his best and true decision is. 
Overall: - 
The story was good but it didn't keep me watching. I ended at episode -- even though I decided to go to Wikipedia and read the plots for each episode to see how the author was going to manage the conclusion and watched the last episode.

What is the worst anime of all times? What is the criteria to even consider, a piece of fiction to such an infamous title? Those are questions I hopefully can end up answering, while giving insight to the colossal mess, that is eva -.-. Many will take certain approach with some reserves, a worst anime of all times discussion usually is only warranted to a certain type of titles. You probably know them by now, those ultra-trashy, low budget ovas, the likes of mars of destruction, skelter heaven, garzeys wing (at least that is because everybody flipped their shit, whenever I tried to argue shows like charlotte were the worst thing I have seen). And while those unanimous bad shows certainly are awful, I would never call them insulting. No one in the production of those were under the impression of making a great show, neither did anyone put any real effort to make it so, so why would I get mad over how bad the final product ended up being. There is no passion, no ambition on such projects, they are just lazily made projects, made in the hopes of getting a laugh or two, because of how bad they are. And those usually succeed on those low ambitions only.  There is nothing to grab here, nothing to get really angry or mad about. Such forgettable anime, no matter technically bad they can be, or how a lot of their individual’s elements are way worse than anything else, will never stand as a worst anime of all times list for me. 
And here I brought the discussion back to evangelion -.-. I was not laughing, when watching, because of how awful all its aspects were. Like there are lots of things even I can admit where incredibly well made, this is a gorgeously well animated, greatly directed,with cool soundtrack, film. The action set pieces are completely stunning, the shot composition (as with anything hideaki anno makes) is superb.  
Neverthless the act of watching this was pure agony, I ended up scratching my face, facepallming and even screaming angrily at everything that was happening on screen. A this is not how this is supposed to be thought, crossing my mind at every moment and scene of the movie. Anyone that is reading this can probably guess by now, I am a diehard fan of the old neon genesis evangelion series, the old series and eoe, being my favorite piece of fiction ever created. It is such a personally important anime, for reasons, I hope I can in write in the future in a pretty fucking long essay. And after finishing those two, the most inspirational and important thing for me, I went and watched all - rebuilds that are out. However before anyone gets any funny ideas, no I do not dislike these movies simply for they are different(I am sorry, NGE is just so perfect doing things another way is usually wrong). I do not want these movies to simply be a scene by scene copy of the series, that would be completely pointless, Eva -.- was almost a carbon copy of the series original episodes, and that only made it passable at best. So let’s get into some specifics of why I loathe this movie.  
For starters, the characters  are not that interesting or fleshed out, especially when compared to its older series counterparts. Sure, in order to streamline this and make the material work as a movie, changes were inevitably going to be made considering, how unlike -.-, this one actually, complicates the plot (a lot) and brings a lot new aspects that were absent in the original (surprise, none of that shit actually worked to its advantage). But really sacrificing a lot of the character depth in eva, in order to make room for more mecha action and plot oriented series? That is a low blown. Remember when we had this superbly made episode - of nge, that great such great insight to shinji’s character, and weight to his relation with Misato? FORGET ABOUT SUCH SHIT, because let me tell you, not only the characters on screen are not that interesting, their interactions are also shafted, there is not enough time dispensed to properly stablishes how every character reacts and affects each other, no relation feels organical or well developed. It all fells so artificial, like these are the works of a checklist, of the minimal things to do, in order to make the audience remotely care and understand the characters. For example, Asuka is on screen for a total of - minutes before falling in love with shinji, talk about contrived character writing. Again a lot of people will not agree on how serious of an issue this ends up being, having a more action heavy, almost blockbuster like formula of this movies is bound to appeal to a lot of people.  
But no, for me most of the appeal of eva was not in the mecha battle, even if those were undoubtedly entertaining to watch, nor in its cheese save the world plot. But in its flawed characters, that had to face not only a lot of pressure from the duty as pilots, but a lot of more universal and relatable personal issues. Like the pains and joys of human interactions, how said interactions may come to define us, our world views, how we see ourselves, how important it is to come on our own as an individual, make your own decisions and take responsibility for their consequences. And to be fair it is not like those ideas are absent in the movie, there is definitely an effort to allude and portray a lot of the same ideas. Though this ends up being mostly wasted effort, the protagonist we see on screen right now, is no longer that complex individual desperately struggling with his fear of rejection, and the fact he never acted upon any of his desires. Now all we end up having is a generic harem lead, that has chicks literally fighting to be his girlfriend. Asuka also really changed, long are gone the days where she was that self-centered bitch, that really needed confirmation from others, while at the same time isolating herself, a person that only defined her value in life for how good she was as a pilot. Currentely she is a generic tsundere, that only cares about the great Shinji Ikari. Anno even had the audacity of changing the iconic evangelion elevator scene, and change the dialogue, from rei’s view of herself, asuka's trauma with her mother and need of confirmation, to a literal fight about who should be shinji’s number - girl. Why would I care, or how could I relate to the themes in display , no matter how personally important they may be? How the fuck I am supposed to really relate to these characters? To make matters simpler, I did not like what they did to my Shinji, my misato, hated what they did to my gendo, and my god, Asuka, what did they do to you? 
Wish fulfillment and escapism are not terms of criticism I really like using against fiction. Those are so overused, because of the way how everything is labelled as such, the terms have lost a lot of their meaning over time. I will have to use those here, because very rarely I have seen something that was so transparent, about its intent of being a wish fulfillment fantasy. If you have any better way, to describe a show where our protagonist literally says, I do not care about the world, I just want to save this cute idealized version of human being, a perfect waifu, please let me know. The tone in here reminded me more of a school comedy if anything, with lots of its aspects, like the constant ecchi fanservice moment being awfully self-indulgent. Eva always had some of that shit, but -.- capitalizes on that by tenfold. And like I get it, presenting this perfect fantasy, of the average male being called out to save the world, and having lots of chick fall in love with him has a lot of thematic purpose in this story. It is that escapism tale, that eva questioned and ""deconstructed"", in its later half, by applying psychology and real world logic to a lot of its clichés. To what degree that is so innovative in mecha (if at all) is very debatable. It turns on its head such fantasy, and in turn brings back important questions of how the audience deals with reality (Are we running away from our problems?) and what purpose fiction has in your lives. So yeah I get what Anno was attempting, it is very deliberate how pandering this ends up feeling, maybe the escalation of those aspects serve to show how bolder, escapism has become in the decades after NGE's release. But it does not change how not worth, the final product ends up becoming, especially for someone that already got a lot of the same ideas, in a way more potent way before. I might end up giving it a pass for the whole rebuild saga, if the meta, franchise angle was well done in -.-, but that sadly was not the case. 
The worst past of all of that is not even present in the movie. The fan reaction to it manages to even more annoying than the movie itself. Like whenever I see someone saying that they like this, because shinji finally acts like a man, I just want to lower my score for it even more. But that, and facts like how this lost that darker and depressive edge of the older series, how more prevalent the action scenes are, all seem to be hailed as great positives.  Many even start to argue to just skip the older series, which is pretty ironical, since there are lots of aspects specially in the next movie that will not make much sense if you skip the older series (you will still not get it even, with the context of both).  
Those opinions, I simply cannot stand that, like I know evangelion is a highly divisive series, but having this being put as a definitive version, something that makes NGE obsolete, is just so unacceptable  Really, I get why people like this, but every minute watching is nothing but a slog of seemling endless torture. Something feels very wrong in every scene, and by that fact alone I can easily say I find the so hated eva -.- to be a superior work. Sure -.- is in a lot of ways a clusterfuck, with a fairly incomprehensible plot, however I never got the same feeling. It feels like eva, it had concepts like Shinji facing alone the consequences of his actions, having to face the weight of killing the person he cared the most, that I could easily get behind, unlike anything in -.- or -.-. So well done -.-, for being the first competent imitation of the original's ideias and mindfucks, that actually had enough bold choices to add anything to EVA as a whole. 
I could keep complaining about every change this movie makes in the original plotline, But for someone who does not want a comparisson series, I sure talk a lot about those. Instead I want to argue, what is the point of this story. While -.- is somewhat understandable, as a new introduction for newer audiences that did not grow up with eva, and -.- brings up an entire new direction for the franchise, -.- is sadly lacking. Sure you could say the purpose was simply to make easily digestible self-indulgent nonsense, that bridges the gap between those two, but outside of that I got nothing. This is such pointless and mostly derivative nonsense. 
In the middle of all of this, a silver line of hope exists. I am talking about the sequel theory of course, the controversial fan theory, that the rebuilds are actually sequels to the original. It may give an entirely new way to approach these characters, and story. Like the more extreme ways the character’s act in -.- could be seen as a natural development of their personalities, it may also give an in series importance to how pedantic a lot of it feels, representing Shinji falling even further into escapism after failing to accept reality after EOE. It retroactively may give some value to some of the things I am complaining about. As for me I would be really surprised if that was not the case, there are way too many fucking hints at the rebuilds actually being a sequel, to the point it will be kind of a surprising twist for me, if that ends up not being the case. Regardless I will wait for -.- to make any form of final judgement on that. And of course this will never redeem -.- in my eyes, but hey, It will become better than what we have right now. 
So those are the reasons for me thinking of this as my worst anime of all times. I am of strong belief, that the individual aspects of a series have no value in, and of themselves. It is how they add up to create the enjoyment, the experience is how I rate and judge fiction, so no, I do not believe this should be rated at least a - for its fantastic technical aspects, or soundtrack. Animation is completely worthless without a great story, a vision, passion and a desire to express ideas. Maybe even all of that alone may not add up to a good show, since with some ideas I have this inherit prejudice with. And maybe that is all there is towards my hate of -.-, but hopefully, I could be more insightful than that. Lastly I would like to add that yes I do recommend -.-. Despite my eternal grievances with it, if you did not like, or just did not care much about NGE, definitely give this is a watch. I hope you end up having a better time.

(This will be my first review. It was orignally a forum comment that I cleaned up to be more appropriate. I'll stick to more detailed manga reviews in the future.) 
The story seems pretty original at first but then it devolves into your generic RomCom, with all the cliché. 
-) Story and Characters: - each 
In the beginning, it looked like the main characters have it all. Yet, under the veneer of wealth, all is not so good. Masamune is popular but thinks excessively of himself. He also has a complex because of of his past. He is confident if we compare him to other MCs of the genre but he just as dense and stupid at times. 
Aki is your generic run-of-the mill  tsundere. She has underlying trust issues and often treats others with contempt. However, she will gradually open her heart to other characters. There's not much to say about it without spoiling the story. As our two protagonists get close to each other, they introduce various plot elements and we get to see their quirks. This their interactions rather entertaining. The side characters are gradually introduced, each adding some spice to the plot. 
The most prominent one would be Yoshino. Presented early into the show as an innocent klutz, she fashionably proved that looks are often deceptive. Who would think that the seemingly innocuous Koiwai would be the catalyst behind the premise of the story? Yet, this is the case. Her past is the most tragic one amoing the whole cast and her interactions with the MC are fascinating, to say the least. 
Kojuuro is your habitual trap. Gentle and shy, he is the opposite of the MC. This is a nice contrast. He is a loyal friend better taste that the main characters when it concerns matters of the heart. Tae Futaba aka Class President is also a moderaely fascinating character. The de facto tomboy genki. Energetic and extraverted, she brings life to the show. Her spontaneity often moved the plot when it began to stagnate and made the show much more enjoyable. Her candour would have won me over if it weren’t for Neko. 
Oh Neko! Many dislike her because her introduction more or less ruined an intimate moment between the two protagonists. Yet, she remains my favorite Character in the show. She reminds me a lot of Marika Tachibana, with a hint of Rem from Re: Zero. Her past is heart-warming and her personality is enthralling.  She is a very forward character and her moments with the other characters are fun to watch. It would be interesting to see a character like her in a leading role. 
The show’s main villain was introduced fairly late, at a fairly inauspicious moment. He does have some genuine motications but nothing much to write about him. He serves more as a plot device and introduced some forced drama. 
-) Art and Sound: - and - respectively 
The voice acting is quite good but nothing spectacular. My biggest complaint would be the generic, annoying high-pitched girl voice opening song. It is way too overused nowadays. On the other side, it’s quite rare for the main Seiyuu (VA) to sing the OP. The sound effects are appropriately used but then again, it's a Rom Com not an Action Anime. The visuals are actually the best part of this anime. There are some gorgeous scenes and they do not suffer from budget issues. The animation is also fluid. 
-) Enjoyment: - 
The pace was more or less satisfactory if we exclude the ending and the direction was average. It isn’t very deep but lies somewhere between a traditional romcom and a romantic drama. Masamune-kun no Revenge managed to portray the restless behaviour that accurs in adolescence in a somehow enjoyable way.  
-) Overall Impression: - 
Overall, this was a passable adaptation of the manga. I would not recommend it though. The story isn't complete and some elements can get too childish.  
Like we say in my country, je suis resté sur ma faim.

After the worst fight of Hajime no Ippo in the movie 'Champion Road' here comes the best fight in the whole series in terms of emotions, there are others that have better boxing quality, but this one is pure gold for all that is at stake for both of them. Also the training, before the fight, their stories, all is awesome. 
Ippo almost doesn't appear in this movie and he is not missed, Kimura is a great character, and even if Ippo is a better boxer his fights begin to be too similar, and his personality doesn't help to be interested in his shameful love story with Kumi.

*this review is almost completely spoiler free, there are two minor spoilers, but they are marked* 
It has now been about a month since I finished watching Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. I remember that after watching the final episode, I was left with this feeling that is sort of a mix of amazement, emptiness and craving for more. It’s difficult to properly describe this sensation, but I think if you’ve ever experienced that feeling, you should know what I’m talking about. Nowadays I rarely feel that felling after finishing an anime, and when I do feel this sensation, I know what I had watched was good. Other anime that have left me with this are for example Clannad, Steins;Gate and Kimi no na wa. If you look at my profile, you’ll see that I consider all these masterpieces. 
Now, let’s focus more on the actual anime. The story starts and progresses like almost any other slice-of-life/romcom anime. The characters kind of feel like very typical, the kind of characters that you see every other show. But more than that they also feel unique and well built with lots of depth in them. That being said, I’m really not an expert when it comes to analyzing that kind of thing.  
The main character (Sorata) is easily the worst character of the anime. On the other hand his female counterpart (Shiina) is interesting in his behalf as well. I felt that I slowly started to like Sorata a bit more after some episodes, but after episode -- his character fell. Let’s say that he was almost at the bottom of a deep canyon in the beginning, slowly staring to climb, after that episode he lost his grip and fell so hard he went through the floor of the canyon. Near the final episodes he almost manages to redeem himself, but as I said, only almost. 
Some of the characters seem to be there just to fill the empty slots. First there is Nanami, who is there pretty much just as a third wheel between Sorata and Shiina. Then there is Ryuunosuke, a shut-in computer genius who has no interest in people, especially girls. And then Rita, who (minor spoiler alert) has to go and fall in love with Ryuunosuke of all people. The only side characters that I felt had some impact on me are Jin and Misaki. To be honest (spoiler alert again), the love story between them is one of the best parts of this anime, despite the fact that Jin is most of the time almost as likable as Sorata (which is obviously not a compliment) but in the end I ended up quite liking him as a character. 
As I mentioned earlier, the story feels like any other anime of similar type (for example Toradora). Meaning it stays quite well within the “safe area”. It doesn’t try to do anything new and different but still manages to be unique. I don’t think that “taking the safe route” in terms of storytelling is necessarily a bad thing, if done well. And in this case, I think it was done well. 
The artstyle looks really nice and the music is decent. I really loved the -nd ending song. The voice actors/actresses do their job well and the voices match the characters quite well. 
The overall rating I gave this anime is -. In reality I would’ve given it -.-, but since I can’t give half-points I rounded it down. Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is without a doubt one of my favourite slice-of-life anime. There are many things I would change to make it better, but overall it was okay. Besides the main character, the biggest complaint I have is that the romance was lacking. It was there, but I would’ve liked for it to be a bigger focus. 
Anyway, this was my first review of an anime. I’m not very experienced in reviews on other things either, I have only written two or three game reviews that use a similar “professional” style. After all that I have one more thing to say, thanks for taking time and reading this.

Claymore is pretty awful and I'm going to use this review to defend that statement. 
It's unfortunate that this show was done by Madhouse because I tend to enjoy a lot of Madhouse shows. But I guess not every show a studio creates can be excellent. This happens to be one of the worst I've watched Madhouse pump out. 
The aesthetic is completely bland. The story follows Clare, a Claymore. Claymores are - foot tall Scandanavian blonde women in this world, apparently. And they wear grey to hammer home the fact that the show is completely stuck in the doldrums. Also, there's a lot of Claymores, and given their design it's hard to tell them apart. Madhouse had to run through the entire gamut of hairstyles for women in this show just to differentiate them. 
There's no character development in this show. What I learned is that there's - leads, Clare and Raki. They're listed as ""mains."" This is a revenge based narrative where the female lead Claire is going after someone, but there's no time for development at all. Clare develops via various deus ex machinas throughout the series as a typical ""power-up"" for no real reason or effort put into it. She gets the power-ups on demand most of the time. This is why there's a real lack of empathy for Clare in this series. It's hard to be motivated to root for someone when they're continually fighting enemies that at first seem to be hopeless no-win scenarios just to have the hero triumph cuz of plot armor. Let's speak about Raki. He's useless. He doesn't do anything except follow Clare. If Clare is written in the active voice, then Raki would definitely have been written entirely in the passive voice. However, Claymore lacks any real depth to use any literary devices. 
The monsters that the Claymores battle are also unimaginative generic copy pasta garbage. 
The sound is pretty unremarkable as well. There's some Scottish bagpipes played in the earlier episodes for some unknown reason. I'm not sure how there's a link between bagpipe playing and this world other than the reason it bears the name Claymore. I guess because all the girls wield the same giant phallic worshipping swords. The tracks do switch to some heavy metal tunes later on around episode --, but it's a little too late. the heavy metal fits the show more, but it's more of a shrug when it comes in. 
And the battles in Claymore are simply awful. They're the worst parts of Dragonball Z, the repeated frames. In Claymore, however, it's even worse as most characters bodies are completely stationary except for a flurry of incomprehensible garbage that's repeated over and over as she flails her sword about repeatedly. 
Stay away from Claymore. Maybe the manga is better, I don't know, but this adaptation is just soul-crushing.

An entire anime made out of tropes. 
It hasn't aged well, I really can't say many works HAVE since the early --'s, but it's not complete garbage. If you grew up watching this anime, there's really no getting around your nostalgia goggles with this one, as many of the good parts of the show are pretty indefensible and sound like complete sociopathy when explained out-loud without context.  
You can't escape tropes in anime, and this is another one where it kind of pioneered them with how prevalent and well-received it was, I remember a lot of kids on the playground crowing over this when it originally aired on toonami. I watched the entire series and the first few movies (in english) religiously from beginning to end and never found myself bored or getting fed up with filler, but if you asked me what the main villains name was or literally anyone other than the Main Characters names, I wouldn't be able to recall to save my life. It's very forgettable and doesn't have any of those iconic moments like in other series, but I certainly still enjoy rewatching the first few episodes every now and again.  
If you enjoy episodic stories that occasionally veer back to a main plot, this is the show that basically invented that formula. It is packed with, and has, fun action sequences and no character ever feels overpowered. If you're older, and watched other anime as a kid, you will almost certainly enjoy this one. I can't say much for the manga, if there was one, I definitely wasn't into reading when this show was popular. Whatever you do, don't expect a masterpiece and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I hate this anime so much yet I cannot stop watching it in the hope that over two hundred episodes down the line the story will actually develop. I now have to take monthly breaks in between of individual episodes so that I can convince myself that the next episode wont be as bad as the last. 
Story: -/-- 
If this section of the review is a mess it is because there is no way in words to describe how horrifically bad fairy tails story is and I have therefore just ranted for a while about how bad it is as well as I could. 
Imagine if nobody ever died even the bad guys. Does that sound like an interesting story with high stakes? This is what Fairy tail is. Not only that but every villain seems to have a change of heart and become good or just comes back to be defeated again. Death is something acknowledged as happening in the past yet literally nobody seems capable of being killed from blows that should destroy entire cities. 
There is no plot development, a horrific seven year skip, an overarching story that disappoints at every turn, so much bad filler, people recover strength from fucking friendship in every fight etc. 
This anime has got to the point where each horrifically short story arc is incredibly easy to predict. The story never changes it is just on a constant loop in which the heros lose then get motivated and come back to win. 
Art: -/-- 
The art has its ups and downs (more downs) but is what you would expect from an anime of this size. I have never been disappointed with the art but it has never excited me either. 
Sound: -/-- 
This anime is made watchable only by its well voiced characters, good sound effects and great music. I still listen to some of this anime's music despite the horrific memories it gives me. 
Characters: -/-- 
The pros of the characters are that they are well designed and all have their own interesting distinct powers. If this anime had been good then I would have been very pleased with the cool way magic is portrayed in such variety. 
The cons of the characters is that they NEVER FUCKING DIE. Literally every character is invincible there are no stakes. They also reintroduce characters that should be long dead and make previous story arcs even more pointless.   More characters are added at such a rate and bad guys convert to good so fast that there are now hundreds of main characters. 
Overall: -/-- 
I'm being generous here when I say this

'Dakaretai Otoko --i ni Odosarete Imasu'/'Dakaichi' just isn't working. As an anime, the series isn't very enjoyable because it can't follow the formula of the manga. The manga is almost entirely sex ...each chapter has gratuitous sex scenes that make up the majority of the plot. Takato and Junta aren't particularly compelling characters but when they were boning their brains out in the manga, you didn't care. But in the anime you're like, 'oh...so these guys...exist.' 
Fact: turning a yaoi title into a shounen-ai doesn't work and Dakaichi is proof of that. The fact that each episode is so long and follows the narrative of the plot without the sex just makes for an awkward and shallow story. I'm not looking for a porno, the manga was enough LOL but there's absolutely no substance to this series. The implied sex/fade to black is strange because the actual sex scenes in the manga take up so much space and so much of the characterization takes place there that the anime counterpart is hollow and at times nonsensical.  
There's no room for character development because this plot revolves around sex that actually isn't happening on screen in the anime. Here's the formula: Takato goes to work, Junta behaves strangely, Takato gets insecure about Junta's oddness, Junta reveals he's been holding back and or forces Takato to sleep with him, they sleep together and that's it. If the series actually does follow the manga's actual story, they have a bit to work with but I think it'll still feel out of place.   
Each episode is so painfully slow, boring and badly paced...I'll probably keep watching but it's a huge waste of time. Find a better BL series or read the manga. The one thing I'll give 'Dakaichi'' is that it's art style is pretty clean, the shading of their jaws are interesting and the main characters don't have massive hands and exaggerated features. The art was good enough! As a fujoshi that's seen A LOT of the BL titles out there, I don't recommend this one.

""-You must be an idiot! You should try dying once! 
by the way, that's a cliché joke in this world where no one can die. So, was it funny?"" 
I'm at a loss for words... 
What could I say? I keep getting surprised with Key's scriptwriters. Who's already familiar with their works, probably heard the name Jun Maeda before. He's the original creator of Angel Beats. You may not like him, but Maeda's (and his coworkers at Key) manner of creating and conducing a story, be it a light-hearted comedy or a melodramatic romance, is definately worthy of praise. Just look around, Clannad, Air, Kanon and recently Little Busters! are all well-known series. 
When you see the description and the pictures for this anime, you actually think there's nothing of ""special"" with it. Guns, girls, music, baseball, god, angels... awesome! But can it all fit together? After a long sequence of Key's emotional stories, I wasn't willing to watch this (aparently) easygoing story with ""afterlife"" or ""purgatory"" theme. There's just too much of it nowadays that it's getting boring. 
Fortunately I gave it a try and watched the first episode...  
Sometimes you find these series with a kick off episode so amazing that throws away all your worries and uncertainties. Starting straight with the OP song, without a preview cutscene, you're introduced to the characters and just a few minutes after it, the story starts to develop. Fast paced like this, the viewers, just like the male protagonist are thrown in this ""afterlife world"" where those who doesn't want to disapear, or reincarnate as a caterpillar, must fight against god. 
I've read a few reviews with really low scores for AngelBeats, the main reason being the ""lack of originality"" regarding it's story. Let's be fair, the anime industry has been producing series for more then -- years, it's reasonable to think that some themes would be repeated. However, a recurrent theme doesn't mean the new releases will all be cliché or repetitive, what's important is the way the theme is approached and the individual elements each anime adds to it. That being said, I consider AngelBeats an ""original"" anime, even tough the basis of its story is not new, the characters, scenario, art and the development of the plot itself, makes it unique. 
This series has that kind of sadistic/dark humor that you can't deny, it is funny, but without all that gore you would usually see in a show with this theme. It's tagged as ""Supernatural"" here in MAL, but it's the ""family"" kind of anime, that you can watch whenever you want. You won't experience those awkward moments where someone who isn't aware of what's going on see the screen in a not-very-correct moment. (Also the amount of fanservice in AngelBeats is minimal.) With ""death"" being part of the story it's certain that there would be violence in it, but it's in a level that isn't disturbing. In the end, you could call it a ""slice-of-afterlife"", since it has all the elements an generic slice-of-life just with a unusual setting. 
For those who aren't familiarized with Maeda's animes yet, it's nice to point out that they're all full of symbolism, and this one isn't an exception. You always have two perspectives and some things are left in the open for you, the viewer, to make your own interpretation. 
That's why I'd always recommend the subbed version. No offense to the dubbers, they're great. But while watching it in japanese you'll always get more from the dialogue and furthermore somethings become easier to understand. 
The plot had some lose ends indeed, but I wouldn't call them ""flaws"". Considering it's just -- episodes long, Key and P.A.Works did a marvelous work with it, if you watch it open minded without paying too much attention to the script you won't find a problem with it at all. 
One common issue with series where there are too many characters like AngelBeats does is that you get lost within. 
It becomes confusing to tell who did what, whose name is that, etc. This is something you won't experience with this anime. The characters -I mean, the PEOPLE- of it, each one of them have it's personality well written and it's own importance in the story (be it a main or supportive character) they all had a carefully written background story that does make you feel like you're watching real people with real problems even when it's something unrealistic as being dead. 
Shiina and Yui, for example, are both supportive characters, but they're important in the plot just like the protagonists, also their mottos and catchy phrases ""how unwise""/""what an idiot"" adds that ""spice"", that extra thing, that were missing to take a laugh out of you at certain scenes. They're not just laying there with the sole purpose of being a side-kick for the main characters.  
How often do you see it? A drama anime that manages to keep its direction and focus in the protagonists but still take care of the supportive characters' problems and happy moments? 
There's just one opening theme for the -- episodes. However, there are small differences in it from one episode to another. Remember when I mentioned the symbolism on Maeda's stories? The OP isn't an exception. The piano, the lights and the way the characters are presented, there's a reason for it all. When you realize it, you start to see it with different eyes and that opening that would be boring to watch becomes interesting. The same applies for the ending theme. The animation of it changes according to the story and in a couple of episodes it's a different song. This is a interesting thing to point out, there're some studios that completely fails to make an emotional ending because after the heartbreaking scene they throw the usual ending theme, a ---%-effective mood killer. In Angel Beats thankfully this doesn't happen and the songs choosen for these couple of endings are wonderful.  
The background soundtrack made for it is nice. It's none masterpiece but fits well with the scenes. If I were to give prise for something of it, would be the sound effects. They used some really nice ones, from horror movies hollywood-style played with classical instruments to new ones made with synthetizers.  
The artwork is nice, atractive and well drawn, but I'd like to open a paragraph here, if I may, for a special topic that isn't covered in the main score neither in the ""art"" section. It would be for the transitions and visual effects of the anime. This would be all those text boxes saying ""in the next day"" but also light and angle effects. These are subjects the animators took great care of. All the transitions from one scene to another had, how could I say, ""style"". Every time the scenario changed, there would be a tag in the corner with the place's name. It becomes even a visual joke in the anime when the characters goes through several places endlessly. The same for facial expressions, you can sense someone put effort on drawing it. From laughing scenes to dramatic ones, they seemed always convincing.  
If I were to write a ""Trivia"" section in this review, it would become too long for it to be read. I'll just say you'll get some really nice laughing moments with some practical jokes, references they make and definately, character quotes. Specially T.K's ones (the english-speaking guy). Pay attention and you may even find ""easter eggs"" of other Key projects such as Clannad and Air. 
I had so much fun with this anime but still I was moved with the emotional scenes. The deeper the story was developing, I was still laughing with the characters but also feeling bad for them. This combination is what makes Angel Beats a masterpiece for me. It's not too dramatic but also not a easygoing comedy, just the exact average between them that I came to love. A beautiful story about life and people. 
Angel Beats is a ""compact"" anime with a clear ending. That's why I don't have hope for the -nd season, however if it happens to appear someday I will be looking foward to it.  
As a final consideration for this review, I'd like to give a advice: Don't watch the special ""Another Epilogue"" right after you finish the main series. Take your time, relax your brain. Otherwise you'll go crazy on theories and alternative endings. Watch it open-minded, without the ""oh, this is so cliché"" kind of thought, and you'll have a great time with it. Enjoyment-o'-meter: ---%.

Some very minor spoilers up ahead. 
‘Gankutsuou’ is an anime adaptation of the --th century author Alexandre Dumas‘ most famous work called ‘The Count of Monte Cristo’. I stumbled upon this anime while going through MyAnimeList’s top selections for something to watch. I was intrigued by it being an adaptation of a classic French masterpiece and many reviews giving it a perfect score so I went ahead and downloaded the only torrent I could find of it that still had seeds. Pretty strange for a highly rated anime series to not have a decent quality torrent but, hey, it’s pirating and you take what you get. 
Before I get into the cream of the pie, I would like to make it known that I have not read the original work. I plan to. The day I manage to find a good physical copy of it locally will be the day I get to absorb what the fuss is about when it comes to Dumas. Thus, this review is not going to contain any comparisons to the original novel, the various film adaptations, and also not the manga and novel adaptations the anime is seemingly related to. With that made clear, I will now pick up my spoon. 
The story starts off, ---- years into the future, in a wild settlement on what appears to be a moon called ‘Luna’. Our main leads Albert Morcerf and Franz d’Epinay are on holiday and cruising around during what is akin to the Mardi Gras until one day when they encounter the enigmatic aristocrat who introduces himself as the Count of Monte Cristo – who Albert falls in respect with. After giving the naive Albert a taste of thrill by letting him choose, with cards, a life to be spared from execution. The danger-fun seeking -- year old is then kidnapped by a gang and subsequently saved by the Count. Albert then asks the Count how he can repay him. After some evil grins and malicious vibes, the Count is introduced to the Parisian and so, the tale shifts into that of men and malefaction. 
Those who have read Dumas’ book already know how the story will go. Those who haven’t read it nor come across the various other adaptations need to know is that Gankutsuou is primarily a tale of revenge, what it does to man, and the dynamics between those ensconced with the act and its morality. While many (seemingly) claim that Gankutsuo is difficult to sum-up, I feel that the Count himself provides an apt summary: 
My solitude has ceased to be solitude. I am surrounded by the goddesses of revenge. 
Seeing as the anime is based off a masterpiece, I can safely say that the pie’s crust has just the right color of golden brown and flakiness. What has to be talked about is the cream itself. Unlike most others, I feel that consistency and flavor of the cream are rather off. There are slight pacing issues here and there along with some terribly directed scenes. 
I don’t mind the pacing problems much. The scenes, though, are ridiculously janky. For example, many characters will fail to see the Count ear-to-ear grimaces even when he is standing right in front of them. Another case(s) would be Albert’s many outbursts – especially when the Count’s intentions are brought into conversation. One would argue that, considering anime, these may very well be minor disturbances but I counter that Gankutsuou takes itself very seriously and, therefore, I should so too. The writers and the director had Dumas’ apparent literary genius with them. Obviously, you would expect refinement: not regression. 
Another thing to note is that, in my opinion, the leap into a galactic future doesn’t do much for the plot except for reinforcing the idea into the cast that the Count’s blue skin, elvish ears, wolfish fangs, and regular visual tomfoolery are probably a product of the advancement of technology. While it does bring the scenery and emotion home in some scenes that have to do with the mystical/spiritual, like in the cavern scene where the Count talks about life with Albert, it is mostly irrelevant. 
Speaking of irrelevancy, it has been brought to my attention that a lot of minor characters who barely appear in the book are given major roles in Gankutsuou. Whether that is a good thing or bad I will find out later. Though, standalone, a decent chunk of the cast was even less decently fleshed out. Albert slowly but surely grows out of naivety. He goes from a mumbling bumbling mess to a man of conviction and heart. Barring Baron Danglar, the man who sold his soul to the stock market, even the Unholy Trinity of Degeneracy that the Count wishes to wage war against is developed enough to not be called plot devices for the development of the Count himself. Honestly, while I watching the anime, my thoughts were that most of the characters were rather one dimensional. In hindsight, I realized that the caricature-ness of some of folks actually embossed a rather quaint charm to the theme of revenge and even the city of Paris. Oh, and the clothes as well. 
Yes, the clothes. Striking clothes. That is because of the animation style that Gankutsuou employs. Highly jarring at first, due to the low quality of some designs, but then rather beautiful late from midway to the conclusion. The style is called ‘Unmoving Plaid’. If you’re too lazy to Google it (and I am too lazy to describe it), then think of the American cartoon Chowder. If you’re a filthy weeaboo then recall Bakemonogatari. Anyway, whereas in Chowder, it is only done with clothes, in Gankutsuou all movable objects not animated with CGI are given the same treatment. The same goes for the CGI. Extremely bad at first but then somewhat improves later. There might have been a weird case with the shifts in quality and budget that could be possibly explained by some rich Dumas fanboy caught wind of the project when half the episodes were already done and decided to make a generous donation. Or maybe not. Who knows. 
While the animation and art style are flamboyant, the sound is the exact opposite. Gonzo, the studio, has worked on many famous works such as ‘Hellsing’ (the original), ‘Full Metal Panic!’, and ‘Welcome to the NHK’ and all of these had excellent soundtracks. The soundtrack is comprised largely of underwhelming orchestral pieces. The only exception to the musical rule is a track that goes ‘ting-ting-ting-ting’ or whatever in tense scenes. The opening and ending songs performed by bass guitarist of the ‘Stranglers’, Jean-Jacques Burnel, tie in to the plot but I personally did not like them. 
To conclude, while I wasn’t much impressed with most of the narrative and the characters I will say that the ending, which is very different from the novel, had me hooked. I can appreciate artists taking creative liberties with another’s work as long as it is close to the level of or better than the original. I know I haven’t read the original work but I now have huge hankering for it. Gankutsuou’s ‘climax’ truly does justice to the term. 
I give The Cunt of Mount Crispy a -.-/-- (rounded off to - for MAL). Not bad. Just good. But since it is a serious work I will give it a serious score otherwise I would have given it a -.-/-- or something. Would I recommend it? Maybe. You might like it more than I did.

Naruto Shippuuden is a very average anime considering it's vast popularity and will make you wonder why it is so popular. Most people who are watching this or is planning to watch this has seen the previous series. I will warn you now with the exception of Naruto chasing after Sasuke and the female characters still being completely useless please forget everything you think you know about Naruto because it is buried one way or another.  
Story -: It manages to keep you in suspense, but sometimes becomes too dark for fans of the lighter  Naruto. 
Art -: The art is still average. Nothing special. 
Sound -: Beware voice actors and tunes that don't fit with a scene. 
Character -: Some characters changed drastically, most stayed the same. Some characters are cliche. 
Enjoyment -: I'm still watching it so I like it overall. 
The series pick up from Naruto two years later and we see how much our heroes grown changing the mood to a darker more mature tone. Part of the reason people stay tuned to Naruto was because of the light and refreshing tone so for it to be almost completely gone puzzles me. It makes me miss the plot line of the old Naruto.  
As for fillers, whether you like it or not fillers need to be use in long anime series so the mangaka can have time to write more. Still I guess the complaining of fans worked because there has been less filler use in the series. The problem is because there has been less filler use the pacing of the show has suffered. Some fights scenes are ridiculously long and constant repeat of the same flashback is the new norm.Even the camera shots are repetitive and unnecessary. For example in one episode with a reunion like air  every five seconds you see the face of a character. It gets infuriating at times. 
Naruto has always been average with their art and this time is no exception. Expect the same overall look with the occasional darker backgrounds to draw more suspense. Also the characters look mostly the same with just a change of their outfit.  
Since this series is darker than the original Naruto so is the music. Even when it is supposed to be a funny moment sometimes the same dark melody will still play. The openings and endings are mostly mediocre, but if you want to check them out then do so! To me the dark tone of music sets the mood, but is overplayed to the point it does not stand out. Background music blends, but also makes the emotion of the scene stand out and Naruto Shippuuden falls to do that. Also it took me a while to get used to the voice actors. I know the characters have changed, but it's only been two years! Naruto's voice in the sub version sounds like a -- year old man! When I watched Naruto I watched it in dub and I liked how their voices(even if it was annoying) matched the age of the character and was unique. Many characters in this series voice has the monotone base that never changes making the character boring. 
Now the moment most people have been waiting for in this review, the characters. ""Do Hinta and Naruto get together?"" ""Who becomes the -th hokage?"" Well I'm sorry I won't be answering those questions, watch it for yourself. Naruto probably changed more than any other character in Naruto Shippuden. No longer is Naruto the repulsive ninja who acts before he thinks, no longer is he immature. The failure of getting Sasuke back and the training with Jiraya molded the Naruto we knew into a man. He is not even naive anymore. Sure chasing after a friend who doesn't want to be saved is naive in a way, but to me is shows his loyalty more. Sakura may have become a medical ninjia and strong like tsunade, but she is still useless like almost every girl in this series. As for Sasuke, if you still liked him after watching Naruto, well you won't now. Sasuke gets so annoying in this Naruto Shippuden it makes no sense. Sometimes you would wish anyone would kill him. Besides old time favorites you get a new set of characters plus a more detailed background of some minor ones like Kakashi. Still the characters are a little cliched. 
Overall I still enjoyed Naruto. It's funny considering at first I was totally against watching the new series, but life changes you sometimes. I would definitely recommend this to fans of the ninja genre! If this review was helpful I am glad I helped you and if it was not well I hope my next review helps you.

So, I've made it to the sixth season of Natsume's Book of Friends. Each season, I feel like this story gets better and better and closer and closer to what I want to see from it.  
My favorite aspect of this season (as has been for the past couple seasons) was the development that we get to see for Natsume and his friends. Unlike previous seasons, though, I feel like this season started to bring Natsume's two worlds together in a way we hadn't seen before, which is something I was highly anticipating. I don't know if the story will take it past the bits we got in this season, but I really hope so. Another thing I really want to see more of that we got a little bit of during this season was some internal conflict going on with Natsume. Like I said, there was some, but I would really love to see a point in the future where Natsume has some pretty serious struggles with the world of youkai and humans.  
There was more development for Reiko this season, as I was hoping for from last season, though it actually felt like a small bit of a decline from season five. However, I enjoyed the anime's way of telling her story this season because we got to hear more about her as a person in her own time rather than this person from however many years ago that could talk to youkai. 
I will say this season, while amazing, seemed like a bit of a set up for what's to come. For example: who are Natsume's grandparents, really? How much power does Natsume actually have? Will there come a time when Natsume thinks it's best to open up to everyone in his life about youkai? Unfortunately, these questions don't get answered this season, but the set up is just as magical and fantastical as all the other seasons have been. 
This anime really does take you to another world and I think, regardless of the fact that it may not start out as everyone's cup of tea, it's going to end up being a lovely anime for anyone to watch.

This anime is basically about there are so many parallel worlds that connected together . And each episode is about the main character (IN other world ) Life. And basically his journey in life .. Why is this so good ? Just finish the entire series and you will know why it is so good. Although , the dialogue is a bit too fast sometimes but somehow i feel that everyone can manage :) IF you are looking at each individual episode , there is no meaning to the anime . You have to carry on watching until the end where all the emotions throw you off. It will make you realized a lot of things and help you mature as a person . It is really REALLY A meaningful anime and the message it carry across is so powerful :)

I've been waiting a long time to give this anime a terrible review somewhere. 
If you have ever watched any other mecha anime you have already seen every single thing that happens in this anime.  The art is pretty good, sometimes even really cool, the music I didn't notice which generally means there was nothing wrong with it. 
Really, from an artistic point of view this anime is fine.  There's nothing wrong with the visuals.  I'd even go so far as to say they're great!  The trouble starts when we move on to the writing side of things.  The story just sort of plods along for episode after episode, with not nearly as much plot development as one would have hoped for.  The villains just sort of mope about, sending out generic mecha monster after generic mecha monster.   
Maybe I could have looked past all these other problems if it weren't for the orgasmic high that all three of the pilots get whenever their mecha link up with eachother.  The whole thing is handled in such a juvenile, silly way that it becomes impossible to take the show seriously after a while.   The fact that all the characters are like lobotomized versions of Escaflowne characters just makes it worse. 
So yeah, if you want to watch a Frankenstein's monster of evangelion and gundam wing, populated with many characters who are vaugly reminicent of much, much cooler characters from other shows, have fun watching Sousei no Aquarion.  I admit, it is amuzing to watch just to sort of chuckle at, but it really offers nothing new or special. 
Also, it was directed by Shoji Kawamori, who should really freaking know better.  For those who don't know who he is, imagine if Hayao Miyazaki made a movie about a group of schoolgirls who all had a crush on some really skeezy older dude, and there were tons of upskirt shots.  Picture that in your mind, and you'll understand my disappointment.

Overall Plastic Memories was a good tearjerker. Every aspect of this Anime was not poorly done, as was it not too over the top. It was very good, earning eights across the board from me, but it could have been better. The art and sounds from the anime were fairly good. Dynamic and fluid, and not listless by any regard. The OP/ED stood out the most from the sound to me. Thankfully the over use of sound bytes/effects never happened. Allowing it to maintain a well rounded approach from start to finish.  
The art of Plastic Memories was visually appealing, you could gain the sense of being there and experiencing it all. Very good in that regard. As follows for the characters of Plastic memories. Each was introduced and developed well in each characters own way. Got some back story, got some relationships, you got everything to build a connection to a character.  For my overall enjoyment, well I really got to enjoy the anime. Mostly in part as it was the first anime I've watched since I came back to the world of anime. I gave it two watches before starting a new one. The feels it gives are just right.  
To finish this off it's story time! Well the story was nice. The concept was good and it felt warm and holding. We didn't start running right from the get go, instead we had a brisk walk for a little bit. Which was great, but of course it really picked up in the late game. Ending with the forecast calling for rain. Have your ticket for feelsville ready to show as you board the train.

My review/score might be biased in writing this because of how annoyed watching this made me. It's not their fault, really. It was just because this is nearly impossible to find anywhere.  
I've never put this much effort into watching anime. After scouring every place I could think of, I found a version of this with Vietnamese subtitles and had to translate it all. In the end, it was just a bunch of regular running gags that kinda lost their glamour after the entire two seasons. I actually liked most of this series, as well as a lot of the specials they put out, but this just wasn't as good as the others. 
It's fun (I guess) if you like the running gags, but there's no new humor to be found and I honestly found it a little bit too repetitive for my tastes.  
I would recommend this if you: liked the first two seasons, like running gags 
I would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like the first two seasons, don't like running gags  
Have a great day everyone!

Vroom vroom vroom it’s anime’s most popular racing series, Initial D. Initial D stars Takumi Fujiwara, a constantly spaced-out and quiet gas station worker with no hobbies or interests in life. The normally reserved Takumi is forced into the spotlight when his incredible talent for street racing is discovered, honed by years of doing tofu deliveries for his father’s business. Takumi is forcibly encouraged by his coworkers and friends into putting his racing abilities to the test in order to defend Akina’s hometown pride. Takumi, who first considers racing completely uninteresting and cars a bore, gradually discovers the sense of accomplishment and pride his new skills bring, and he’s even more desperate to prove himself as a racer when his carsick love interest compliments his smooth driving. 
Takumi is supported by his best friend and racing fanatic Itsuki, as well as upperclassman and lead racer of the Akina Speed Stars, Iketani. Also important are the opponents Takumi races against, most notably the Takahashi brothers, elite racers whose region-ruling elder brother Takahashi analytically plots to defeat the new unstoppable racer. Initial D’s cast is generally realistic and likeable, with mild yet distinct personality archetypes. Characters are passionate about their hobby and take it seriously, but winning or losing at the sport is hardly considered the end of the world. Takumi’s interest in cars and racing grows at an appropriately slow pace and noticing the nuances of his changed perspective on the subject is rewarding and feels natural, but beyond that little of the cast evolves as people. Takumi’s hobby brings out a competitive spirit in him, but he remains unassertive and distant throughout the season. It’s endearing at first when Takumi is the underdog, his lack of charisma going full circle and becoming genuine charisma when contrasted with his confident opponents, but the small range of his personality gets old. His incompetent relationship with Natsuki is cute and does evolve throughout the show, but is otherwise uninteresting to follow. Natsuki has no involvement with the part of the show having to do with racing, and their chemistry is only supported by the childhood friend angle. I have no idea why Natsuki would be interested in a guy who only gives one word responses, doesn’t start conversations, and has no interests or hobbies, but she’s all over him. The supporting cast is weak because everyone plays diffident comic cheerleader to Takumi. The screeching and melodramatic Itsuki straddles the fine line between endearing and unbelievably annoying, just barely landing on the former because of the few subplots in which his incompetency with racing and people despite his passion garners genuine sympathy from the viewer. Iketani ends up listless outside of a short romantic subplot. He’s supposed to be Akina’s number one racer until Takumi shows up, but what little we see of his driving ability is completely unimpressive and far from knowledgeable about racing compared to the rest of the cast. Takumi is also observed in the shadows by his father Bunta, a former street racer who was legendary in his time, and his boss Yuuichi, an experienced driver and friend of Bunta. 
The main attraction of Initial D are the races, but there can be a lot of time between them spent on developing the next opponent, preparation, or comedy/daily life between the main characters. Probably more so than most sports anime. This can occasionally be a drag as the races themselves are never in more than three episodes, with even the final race being a meager two. The anime does assume a fair bit of prior knowledge regarding racing and car terminology on the viewer, and it’s arbitrary which parts are explained and to what detail. I had a particularly problem following the physical logic of the races, where characters would explain how a technique was pulled off but without any kind of visual aid. With little racing knowledge such as myself, hearing about how one of the cars moved by shifting gravity and whatnot seems sensible, but it’s difficult to envision and perfectly understand just through dialogue and the simple racing animations which also makes it harder to appreciate the creativity behind the races and the technique itself. 
While the framerate of Initial D can be choppy and there might not be a lot of movement, the art itself is solid and pleasant to look at – for the most part. Many criticize the “fish-like” eyes and lips of the character designs, but they’re meant to resemble original manga artist Shigeno Shuuichi’s art style and it’s distinct otherwise, so I like it. By far the most controversial aspect of Initial D’s animation is its use of computer-generated -D renders for the cars. CG animation was starting to catch on around this time with many studios believing it was the natural evolution of animation. Initial D’s studios jumped the gun on what was still a niche form of animation and haphazardly shoved it into their series in an attempt to look hip and progressive. The irony, as we know now, is that the CG is immediately the aspect of Initial D that dates it the most. Even though CG was a newer animation form than the cel animation used otherwise, the older form is professionally done by experienced animators and has hit around a universal standard of quality in anime, while the CG is technologically primitive and employed by people who have less experience using it. Initial D’s CG cars are basic models that lack texture to give them a realistic surface and have bold, flat colors that contrast heavily with the surrounding environment of -D animation. So the animation styles clash, look ugly, and break the series cohesion, but what else? 
Initial D’s studios also use the CG as an excuse to cut corners (as is often the case with CG ever since). One of the most noticeable things about scenes with CG in the frames is that the -D cels they’re on will be completely unanimated. Not only is this awkward if you take the time to notice how everyone and everything in the background is as still as a tree as a car pulls up, but any attempts to mask this lack of moving frames is hilariously embarrassing. A constant technique used is to have a CG car pass in front of a group of people in the background, such as driving across a road horizontally, and then have that still frame of spectators swapped another single frame of them looking in the other direction. Cheap animation has been a part of anime since its inception, but not often will you find a --s anime that reminds you of Astro Boy of all things. And It really is laziness – I can count on one hand the amount of times the series has -D animation in the same frame as CG animation, but they can clearly do it. There are also occasional instances of disproportional scales and perspective, where a person standing by a car is way bigger than they should be given their distance. Use of CG also discourages use of traditional animation techniques to emphasize a sense of speed. There’s no motion lines, blur, or anything of that sort to drive that sense of whiplash in your face.  
This makes the way the races are directed and portrayed far duller than they have to be, or should be. Without such things as those traditional techniques noted earlier there are no ways to distinguish how fast the cars are going in the animation other than speeding up the rate at which the CG model is dragged across the screen, which could look ridiculous. The visual dynamic of the races is extremely hindered in this way, as the cars going across the screen looks the same no matter how many times they do it throughout the series. This means the drama and intensity of the races is primarily conveyed to the viewer literally, by characters commenting on what’s happening during the race or the sense of speed. But the audience should feel like a front row spectator, not needing to have it explained to them in a visual medium about racing what the stakes are or what the rhythm of the race is. The visuals should shift throughout the races to mimic the adrenaline rush and conflicts of the drivers themselves and recreate the dramatic perspective of what the characters are experiencing, rather than have it delivered in such a plain, flavorless manner that it doesn’t sell the intensity of the race but instead dilutes it by having it conflict with the excitement of the literal narrative as delivered through the dialogue. This is, without a doubt, the weakest part of Initial D. The CG cars are not cute or endearing, nor do they simply look aesthetically unappealing as they clash with the primary animation style. The real issue is that they’re an active detriment to the very core purpose of the series, that are used to circumvent positive direction and animation techniques that would make the series more exciting. The studios didn’t have the ambition to take Initial D to the level it should have been and the most important part of the show, the races, suffer greatly for it. Basically, watch Redline and note the masterful ways it manipulates the motion of its animation to emphasize fluidity and speed and notice how none of them are used in Initial D. Even noting the fact that Redline is a blatant fantasy while Initial D is more grounded, that’s no excuse why a series in that vein can’t attempt more tactful use of such techniques to push the action without crossing the line into absurdity. If it’s not even going to try any of that, then what’s the point of animating? 
I’m definitely interested in the future of Initial D. While storytelling progress in this first season has been leisurely at best, it hasn’t paused for long enough to give me the impression that Initial D has reached its full potential. Shuuichi Shigeno seems to realize the basics of having to introduce twists to keep the races interesting, and as he should predictably become more desperate he’ll hopefully bring more dramatic and significant deviations to the formula. This is all presumption though, as it still depends on Shigeno’s intelligence and ambition to take Initial D to the next level. Improvements in directing and animation could also be a major help. Though Initial D is a lukewarm thriller so far, there are enough hints of promise to keep me curious in where it could go so I’ll probably watch to its completion. A street racing anime is a fine concept, but it hasn’t come close to full throttle.

I don't know why people say it's the most cliche anime ever but to me it is most definitely not! The first series was okay saying it was not all actual storyline and some random episodes of nothingness but it's evolved to a complex meaningful storyline if you can't handle a lot of different storylines at once then don't hate on it. It is fun, action packed, exciting and yes sad all at the same time. I won't tell you how it's sad because that's for you to find out but it is a really great storyline and meaningful i would recommend this to people who like action, can handle a lot, or someone who want's a meaningful storyline.

From the standpoint of someone who watched this just to kill time during the daily commute: 
Normally any such anime I watch just needs to have decent art/animation and explosions or similar to satisfy me. No character development or great story is expected. The first season fit this criteria, so I would have been fine with more of the same in the second. 
The art and animation was fine, the fighting was fine, not too much drawn-out downtime nonsense, it should have had all the makings of a nice mediocre subway watch. But read on... 
Now, anytime I watch shounen stuff I mentally steel myself for the ridiculous convictions the main characters tend to hold and spew forth at any given opportunity. But when it comes to Yu and his 'family', and their motivations and actions when it comes to 'family', I couldn't handle it. It got so much worse this second season. It's immature of me to be emotionally affected by an anime like this one but I will admit I got a little upset. The sheer stupidity and hypocrisy hit me like a sledgehammer. This is of course far from the only anime that contains this sort of thing but I simply cannot fathom why this IP is so popular given the above. I sure hope nobody thinks that his way of thinking is honorable or admirable. I was able to finish the season only because I held on to the improbable belief that all the main characters would die horribly as divine retribution. 
tl;dr It was mediocre, but my personal sensitivity to the extreme nonsense that counts as the main character's reason for existence made it next to unwatchable. I finished it half because I am a glutton for punishment and half because it was just a timekiller on the commute anyway.

Don't trust this review. Most viewers think this show is a masterpiece, thus by probability you will most likely think the same thing. I'm going to say some harsh things in this review, but even if you think my word is the gospel, you should still watch the first few episodes of the show. And remember, a - is not a bad score. I did not dislike this anime at all.  
First, on to the good stuff. This has a premise where a man is punished for doing the right thing. It starts off excellently, following his torment and the bizarre chain of consequences following his decision. The art is in a striking style that seems perfectly wed to the story at the beginning. From these first episodes, I had the feeling that this show was going to be a masterpiece.  
However, this show slowly collapsed in to its own cage. What was interesting became repetitive, the novelty of the art style wore off, predictable patterns began emerging, and pet peeves that wouldn't make a difference in a -- episode season became more and more grating.  
I almost don't want to reveal what predictable things become annoying, because maybe the reader wouldn't have noticed it before I said anything. An example, we have a standoff. Two important characters, high suspense, one character pulls the trigger. GUNSHOT sound, cuts away to outside of building, leaving what happens a mystery. Hey, it's suspense! Another one; a character is talking, he will say ""blah blah blah, *pause* no, *pause* blah blah blah"". Why? Its all in the tension, Mr. Smith, no, Mr. Revealed! I know all about you know! It's an effective enough line that if one character had it, as a sort of signature line, it would have been amazing. However, when everyone has the same distinctive signature line, it gets rather silly. A fun little game to play with this anime is to try saying ""iie"" (""no"") in unison with the character. Another quirky thing that many characters do verbally is repeat a word over and over again, as a sort of dramatic buildup. Often, this will lead up to a scream.  I commented to my friends that the dialogue seemed like it came from a comic book, and they couldn't help but agree. Here's another one: as a character is having a flashback, about to remember something important, something will always cut off the memory (unitl the end of course, when all the beans are spilled). Maybe an interruption, or else maybe she won't want to continue remembering. What we end up with are a gadzillion flashbacks. As another reviewer put it, these are ""shameless efforts to create nail-biters”.   
Some details in this anime also just don't make sense. Like, nobody even alters their appearance (except Johan). Dr. Tenma is wanted, his face has been all over the news, and he just walks around in broad daylight and is surprised when he is caught. I mean, really? In many cases, he's behaving quite suspiciously too, just begging for attention to be drawn to him. An amusing example of a detail that didn't make sense was when a character walked into a room, she was perfectly composed. She pulls out a gun, and *suddenly* she is completely out of breath, as if she had just run a marathon. Yes, I know pulling a gun on someone is exciting, but it was completely ridiculous. A detail that more amused me than bothered me was the way they used guns in this show. A detective walks into a room, points a gun randomly in one direction, suddenly swerves to point randomly in another direction, and then suddenly swerves once again to point randomly at the camera, before putting the gun down and looking around. If a bad guy was actually where the camera was at, he would have shot the detective as soon as he walked in, but hey, pointing the gun in random directions is exciting!  
A lot of reviewers will place this anime on a pedestal and claim that it is a mature anime, as if somehow those of us who didn't love it are childish. Don't fall for that nonsense, you'll see it in reviewers whenever an anime tries to be deep. It isn't really all that deep. It's a good show still, I enjoyed it myself for all that I've been bashing it, - is still above -, which represents average.

Made in Abyss is an anime beautifully crafted by studio Kinema Citrus. It features characters with their own little unique twists, art in which every frame can be used as a background for your computer, soundtracks that you'd carry with you just to listen, and memorable characters. 
Kinema Citrus isn't very popular, understandably - after all, they made some mediocre anime that normally features a -/--; examples being:  
- Black Bullet (----) 
- Yuyushiki (----) 
- Gochiusa (----) 
They don't typically do a lot of action anime, and more inclined to and successful with the slice of life genre, and to anyone who bears witness to Kinema Citrus, prepare to be shocked: they delivered a masterpiece. 
Story (-/--): The story is revolved around Riko, a young girl who is a Red Whistle, an apprentice Cave Raider - the most inexperienced of Cave Raiders - and Riko wishes to and aspires to be a White Whistle just like her legendary, famous mother, Lyza. The Cave Raiders constantly go in and out of the Abyss, a huge pit that dwells far into the Earth, holding relics and unique, and simultaneously deadly creatures. 
This concept expresses that of a huge imagination and I felt that the studio did everything right in their power in expressing the story as beautifully as they can. You can understand most concepts, and you might get lost a few times, but you'll have painted the general picture and perhaps hold an attachment to the creative ideas given to you. 
Art (--/--): You can tell that most of it appears to be frame-by-frame instead of CG. Generally-speaking, frame-by-frame hand-drawn is better, but there are definitely a few moments where there is CG - and Kinema Citrus managed to make it blend well with the traditional art style. There's barely anything that looks out of place, and the animators sure deserve a commendation for the hard work they put into every detail. There are so many moments that you could just screencap and use as a background for your computer. 
Sound (-/--): An amazing, exhilarating soundtrack. There are two soundtracks that you'll fall in love with, those being: 
Hanezeve Caradhina (ft.Takeshi Saito) 
Underground River (ft.Raj Ramayya) 
The soundtrack is incredibly unique and definitely fits the fantasy feel that you get from watching this anime. Whoever was in charge of sound effects was definitely trying to put as many sounds appropriate to try and attach the viewers to what they were viewing, and it worked generally well. Every single clink, every single tap, every single footstep and contact, you could hear and feel. 
Character (-/--): The two main characters, Reg and Riko have their own quirks about them, and even then, the characters that surround them and are of less importance have their own special quirks about them. You'll come to appreciate each character you come across, even if they don't have quite a lot of screentime. Unique, every single one of them. However, it is due to this uniqueness that sometimes, there is too much emphasis on a character and you'll be expecting so much more from them, but they are definitely in-depth. 
Enjoyment (--/--): The episodes just engage you, and with each episode, you just yearn for the next. There are short clips of the last moments of previous episodes at the start of each, so you'll be able to get the gist of what happened last time, and keep pushing on. It's so engaging, and all of the elements presented tie into that. You could feel as if you were there. 
Overall, --/--. Congrats, Kinema Orange - I just hope you can keep up this much quality into what you cover.

Here goes nothing 
A review of Eva and EOA 
a bit of backstory 
Around - years ago,I read the evangelion manga,since  a lot of people told me it was  the best anime and that it was complex 
Silly me thought it was an adaptation,it wasn't,I didnt like it, i decided i should watch the end of evangelion,since the manga was unfinished 
I didn't like the characters much,but I was in high school and in that time, 
I always finished what i started watching. 
It was a fucking mistake,I felt the story was too bogged down by symbolism and the characters were a joke. 
After years of ranting every time I heard about evangelion on comment sections of the internet 
I decided I should go back and watch the anime series,hopefully thinking that I was wrong and there was something worth of my time back then. 
Let's start with the good: 
The design and the sound 
All of the characters visual design are iconic 
the backgrounds work 
it has a certain atmosphere that gets to you, 
If there's something flawless in the franchise,its this point,the music,shiro sagisu's work is good mostly,certain moments are great and interesting, 
Certain tracks get you a  bit pumped even by themselves 
The original voices,are fitting and not annoying for the most part. 
Now,for me,characters and story are the important parts of any series,it's here where the series lack,see,the characters.while a little bit more developed than say,knights of the zodiac,are not relatable or sympathetic 
See Shinji,starts as a coward character,who halfway through the series,seems to get some courage,but by the end of it reverses back on his old ways,in the manga i hated him,in the series,he's not that bad,at least not for the most part but for me,bringing him back to that cowardly position is a bad choice,why delve into someone's mind if you dont like him or find him interesting at all. 
Asuka's even worse,I had to take her annoying voice as a child on the brink of murdering someone,she's not likeable,her backstory is very simple and boring,her motivations are very silly,proving herself to Kaji and later just to anyone. 
Rei is as dull as they come,she's even worse than her manga counterpart,just a line here or there. At least there she had a hint of a relationship with Shinji. 
The rest of the cast is hit or miss 
Gendo's motivations are confusing,he's less likeable than his manga counterpart as well 
Ritsuko tacked-on backstory feels silly 
The kids,toji and the one with the glasses are ok,whoever decided to kill Toji in the manga deserves a punch to the face. 
Kaji is still a womanizer but we dont see a lot of him really 
Misato  instead,comes off as a better character on the series,we delve more into her relationship both Shinji and Kaji,she has motivations,she cares,she's just a woman in a storm of crazy confusing plots 
The story for the most part,is a generic mecha monster of the week show with a mystery ,while some questions are answered,most of them are not,at least not in a clear fashion self concluding way, 
What do i mean by this,see,the  creators made such a mess of a series that they sometimes answer questions of the series in conferences,which are then spewed out by fans, 
To me,this isnt satisfactory at all,a series shouldnt have its questions answered outside of it,its like buying a ticket for a ride and instead someone's telling you what happens in the ride 
Back to the series,its mostly episodic just right before the ending we get some good drama,but it gets undercut because of budget problems and the series shows it specially in one scene in episode -- or -- 
There's a scene where it tooks a whole minute to move out of a frame,I couldnt believe it,what a cheap way to fill time,there's another where it's a thirty second wait,there's half an episode of clips 
The animation of the battles though,is another story,they're fluid and sometimes beautiful. 
I could've accepted time filling if it wasn't for the bad part of the series,see,the author was depressed before making the series,this is his way of getting out of it and it shows 
Tts filled with half ass references to Freudian and Jung psychology(One of them is outdated and ridiculous,The other one symbolistic) and philosophy,which also fill time by getting this repeating scenes, 
See,im all for anime or movies dealing with those two subjects if done well,the execution of the series and movie is piss poor 
The movie continues the series where the show after two episodes of filler and bad philosophy left off,Shinji's been broken down,all the angels have been defeated but for some unexplicable stupid reason Seele wants to cause the third impact and so does Gendo,which makes all the series rendered moot and stupid,hurray! 
We get someone jacking off,good action scenes,misato being cool,gendo being an asshole,this is all fine and dandy until we get a trippy scene which then breaks down into some avant garde scene with video of  an audience on a movie theater,images from japan, text and clips from the show,the movie then ends with the line that defines the whole franchise:how disgusting(whether its i feel sick or how disgusting is a problem for the subs) 
See,most people who read this will probably assume that i came back with a bit of prejudice,i did somewhat,but i really wanted to like the series 
I just couldnt,at best it's mediocre,if ignore the bad philosophy and psychology 
At worst,it feels like a high school essay on both subjects,in the end, 
I just didnt like it,i felt peace while rewatching the series though,my mind finally rested from the torture of the doubt if the series was any good,if you want a better series with self conclusion stories,that deals with heavy subjects,go watch ghost in the shell or lain 
This is a cult anime show,only for the hardcore fans who get too much into it,if you're a newbie,i say take a pass and go do something better with your life 
EDIT ----: 
In hindsight,with now new knowledge that was given to me by some internet posts. I still stand by me decision to give it a -. Mind you I should post some old Locomotion channel trailers that promise God vs Humans. This was misleading. Also,I kind of expected Evangelion to be more like the original Mobile suit Gundam ----. Yet to fault it because it is not similar. It's stupid.  Without Gundam,there is no point to Eva. Eva is the watchmen of mecha anime as watchmen was to superhero comics. It is about deconstrucionism. I don't like deconstructions. To me they are very fucking boring 
If and only IF  I compare it to modern anime,I would give this a -.  
At least EVA tries and has ambition.

I watched recently Macross SDF and I loved so much. And then I wanted to keep watching the secuels and, after Macross Plus ( this one is pretty good), I watched this. 
I'm trying so hard to describe with words how much disappointed I am with the work they done over here. 
This anime was made in ---- - ----. We are talking about -- years after the other Macross show (Macross -), and there is a very high jump in animation improvement, but, it seems that, that much that they improved in animation, they lost it in imagination. 
In Macross Frontier we can see the same approach, with the same - Heroines, secondary characters that don't contribute so much to the history. 
We can see in, all the serie along, how the it trys to ""Looks like Macross SDF"". Apporting that fanservice that even gonnes wrong all time. 
Also, other thing that pissed me off are the songs.  
In Macross, the voice, the sing of the heroine is one of the most important factors, and the way of transmit feelings to the viewer, BUT! There are so many ways to do it. 
Here, the song didn't transmit the feeling that you were looking for if you come from Macross SDF. Here, the songs are just OST, putted there to make the viewer like them forced with an Idol half naked. You can't In any moment that the singer its feeling the song, even you cant feel it, its so sad. 
The Episode Distribution: 
There was also an other point of the show that annoyed me so much is, how ""heavy"" were the episodes, It's like the episode tries so hard to tell so many things, so many story lines, and made it so hard to swallow, ( and, in the end you realize that all was pointless.) 
I won't recomend this anime show to noboddy that enjoyed Macross SDF, just for not destroy their illusions like mines.

Just to be clear, - isn't a bad score; I'm only saying this show is average. 
Harems have always had a bad reputation among people due to their lack of originality. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or NouKome, is no different and is almost exactly what you would expect it to be. It's definitely nothing groundbreaking, as most would expect from a harem, ecchi show. I was originally pretty hyped for this show because the synopsis was interesting and I thought this ""absolute choice"" plot point described in the synopsis would create some pretty hilarious situations. I was correct in this assumption, but as it stands, NouKome is still generic and littered with tropes you often find in harems. Even though it lacks originality, the high amounts of comedy is something worth mentioning, so you shouldn't dismiss NouKome immediately. 
The story for this show is mediocre, though it is actually decently original, considering its genre. The basic premise of this show is that our main protagonist, Kanade Amakusa, suffers from a condition, or curse, known as Absolute Choice, which forces you to choose between two options that appear in your head, or else you get severe headaches. Right off the bat, you can probably understand how this element in the story allows for some pretty hilarious moments. Unfortunately, even though this show is quite funny, it still lacks an actual plot. The story doesn't ever go anywhere, and even though Kanade really wants to fix his condition, he doesn't by the end of the show. Granted, this could be to allow room for a second season, though I don't believe there is one announced. This show is listed as a romance, but that's a bit misleading. Most of the girls fall for him, but, to everyone's dismay, he never chooses one of them. The high point of this show is comedy, but some of the jokes simply fall flat, or get watered down by the ecchi elements. It also ends with an obligatory, harem beach episode and its full of extra fanservice. Anyway, you shouldn't try and watch this show for its amazing story line for it has none. 
The show is animated fairly well, but so are most shows nowadays. A strange trend that I see in anime that this show has is how everything seems ""shiny."" Hair, clothes, and skin often reflect so much light that it masks them in a blazing glow. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but everything is still shiny. All the light also seems to have a red tint. It's pretty noticeable, however, it shouldn't detract too much from the anime. Characters move fluidly for the most part. There's really nothing to complain about. I mean, nothing moves like a robot, so you shouldn't be bothered by it for the most part. Every character is drawn pretty well, though they seem to constantly blush, which could annoy some people. 
The voice acting is nice, but a lot of the girls have a squeaky, high-pitched voices. It feels like all of the girls are voiced by the same person. The acting isn't bad, but some of the voices get annoying over time. You could also say the voices are cute, so the squeaky voices could be considered a positive. Nothing else of note comes to mind concerning the audio. The music for the OP and ED are actually decent, but nowhere near exceptional. 
As you might expect, a lot of the girl's characters in this show are based on generic, harem archetypes. Though, honestly, the girls are unique in some ways and offer a relatively unique twist on their base archetypes. Let's first talk about Kanade Amakusa though: our male lead. I hate to say this, but he's also pretty much another generic archetype. Which archetype? The male lead archetype that is oblivious towards all romantic feelings directed towards him. I'm less mad at the archetype now than the fact that Kanade's barely an original character. Kanade is also kind of snarky and snide. All the girls want to marry him, and he is oblivious of this: that sums him up. Back to the girls. By the fact I constantly refer to them as ""the girls,"" you should understand that they are essentially one big character. To the shows credit, they are pretty quirky in their own way. Chocolat, our female lead, is as funny as she is gluttonous. She falls from the sky in order to help Kanade with his Absolute Choice. She fails at it and that makes her somewhat likable. Most of the time though, character's like Yuouji and Yukihira are just targets for various missions Kanade is given to complete. By the way, Kanade completes missions to prevent him from being stuck with Absolute Choice forever. I don't know how it works, but NouKome doesn't bother explaining it. He's assigned these missions by God who is pretty much the pinnacle of awesome. God is, well, God. He loses points for not letting us see his face though. I should also mention the existence of the Reject - and Popular -. Kanade and much of his harem happen to be in the Reject - for they do strange things. Kanade is often forced into those actions because of Absolute Choice. 
Character's don't seem to develop in NouKome. They exit the story the way they enter and that proves to be pretty annoying. Again, don't expect much from the story. 
It's not like this show is not enjoyable. It's far from it. Characters like Kanade will peeve you off, but its bearable so we can try and ignore it. If you can get past Kanade and his obliviousness, you get to the meat of this show: it's comedy. Some occasional jokes aren't too funny, but most of the humor is chuckle-worthy. Also, most of the complaints I have only become relevant in the last few episodes of this anime, so the first, around -/- of NouKome is enjoyable. They really crank up the fanservice in the last portion. 
In the end, Noukome is a harem that's got humor going for it. If you have a lot of harems you would like to watch, NouKome should probably be on the top of all those. It's better than a various assortment of harems, but it's still nothing special. Luckily, it's only -- episodes. I still wouldn't recommend marathoning it, but I would recommend watching it in small doses if you're into harems. Overall, I would say NouKome is an average anime, but fine for people who like ecchi and harem.

Note: I got to see this at a special premiere screening in my city, with Masaaki Yuasa himself in attendance! He's a very lovely guy. I hope that hasn't biased my review too much. 
This film is closely intertwined with The Tatami Galaxy, a previous Yuasa-directed work. Their original novels were written by the same author, they share a setting in Kyoto and apparently take place in the same universe - many characters from TG pop up here and there in NiS, if not always in the way you expect them to. It's not strictly a sequel, but you'll get much more out of the film if you've seen Tatami, so that's something to consider. 
Night is Short, much like Tatami Galaxy, is a bit of a difficult sell plot-wise - it focuses mostly on a college student only named Senpai whose only goal is to win the heart of his crush, the titular Girl, over the course of a night in which the two are out and about in Kyoto. Of course, it's not quite that simple- inventive camerawork and use of surrealism turn what could have been a very dull story into an amazingly fun adventure through Kyoto with a bouncy, dynamic cast of lovable characters. 
Without revealing too much, the film retains Tatami Galaxy's distinctive, surreal visual style and sense of humour, but is much more lighthearted, comedic, and amazingly over-the-top in places without missing out on conveying its own messages. If you liked Tatami Galaxy, I can practically guarantee you'll love Night is Short. 
The increased film budget combined with Yuasa's direction style lead to some beautiful animation sequences, and the Girl is so amazingly cheery, she can't help but grab your interest. An easy --/-- from me, but then again I also loved Tatami.

'Taste the regret, bitter as it may be, and indulge in it' 
The movie, as most already knows, is a sequel to the series 'Tamako Market' in which the everyday life of the people in a certain street is portrayed throughout the series along with a special but chubby bird. 
The driving force of this story focuses on the loose ends that were left from the series and it is the most glaring loose end that would leave you thinking, 'What about those two? What happened next?' As most series that leave such a cliffhanger, the Tamako series thankfully, has moved off the mainstream and decided to do a little fan-service for the fans of this series(thank you very much!) 
Another thing to note, the movie also shows how each character begins to grow steadily and shows them moving forward with their lives instead of being attached to what they hold dear to them and also moving off their comfort zone. As the ---episode series did not really show much growth in most of the characters, the movie at least, showed how the main characters grew in their own respective pace. Some may have been slightly late but by the end, everybody managed to a better person than they were before. 
Overall, a really enjoyable movie as I myself enjoyed the series that preceded it as it still did not lose the 'carefree-ness' and cuteness of its girl cast. It is highly recommended to watch the series before the movie because there are quite a bunch of loopholes if one were to jump straight to the movies.

Tamako Love Story, also known as the sequel movie to the TV animation series 'Tamako Market', follows the story of an innocent girl named Tamako who recieves a confession from Mochizou, whom she considered only as her childhood friend. In this movie the viewer gets to have the chance to experience the romance aspect of the series between Tamako and Mochizou which was rather lacking in the TV animation series. 
As the movie focuses on the relationship development between Tamako and Mochizou, the characters from the island are left out of the main story, but instead we get to see a little more Tamako's school friends Kanna, Midori and Shiori.  
The story itself is very unoriginal - something that anyone has experienced and something that will remind you of your own love experiences back in the days or maybe something that you are having right now. I believe this is why it is very easy to imagine yourself in either one of the protagonists' perspectives and thus making the story, despite its unoriginality, very enjoyable and something the viewer can sympathize with.  
KyoAni, as expected, delivers not only its stunning visuals which can be seen through amazing backgrounds and facial expressions that I once believed were unable to be drawn/expressed in the -D world, but also soundtracks. The ED of the movie is namely the song composed by Tamako's father which he used to confess his feelings to Tamako's mother - only this time sung by our female protagonist, Tamako which goes along with the final scene of this movie very well.  
Overall, I thought the story was very well executed and certainly exceeded my low expectations after finishing the TV animation series, Tamako Market.  I tried to make no spoilers so there might be many aspects of this show lacking in this review, but I hope this will give you a thought to try this movie out (whether you watched the prequel or not since it does not play a crucial role to understand the plot of this movie).  
I give this an - out of --.

Title: Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World 
Novel/Anime: Kino no Tabi originally began as a series of light novels, authored by Keichii Sigsawa and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi.  Installments began running in MediaWorks' magazine Dengeki hp in March ----, and it is still running, currently with ten compiled volumes available.  Tokyopop has licensed the light novels Stateside, and the first volume was released in October of ----. 
The anime itself was done by Studio Wombat, which did the animation for the End of Evangelion movie, and directed by Ryutaro Nakamura, who also directed REC and Serial Experiment Lain.  It ran from April -th, ---- to July -th, ---- in Japan.  ADV Films licensed it Stateside and ran it under the title Kino's Journey; the fourth and final volume was released Stateside June --th, ----. 
Story: Kino no Tabi focuses on Kino, her talking motorcycle named Hermes, and their travels together.  Kino has only two real rules about her travels; one, she never gets involved with anything going on in the countries she visits, and two, she never stays for more than three days. 
This is a really neat series.  None of the episodes really connect to each other; they're more like one-shots, with the only real thing linking them being the fact that they're stops on Kino's journey.  But each one of these stops provides some kind of insight on human nature, or on Kino herself.  And the plot for each episode is exquisite, some of the best writing I've seen in a while.   
You end up bonding with Kino and Hermes, too, as the episodes go on, which is vital for the series' sucess; if you hadn't been able to feel with them, the series wouldn't have had nearly as much impact as it did.   
There is a laundry list of things that appear in every single episodes; however, these end up being more endearing than grating. 
Also, there is some blood in this series; nothing over the top, but if you don't like blood, it'll be more than enough. 
Pilot Episode: Kino no Tabi's ---minute pilot episode, The Tower Country, provides a good basis for what the rest of the series was like, and introduced some of the mainstays of every episode.  It's not the best story, but it's a strong story, nonetheless. 
Art: The art style is a bit simpler than I've seen in other series, a bit more linear than it is smooth, similar to the style seen in Fantastic Children.  However, it's still beautiful, and fits this series perfectly. 
Music: This series barely even needs background music, but when it does use it, it's absolutely beautiful, and calming.  The same goes for the OP and ED for this series.  I went to find this OST, and I've actually been using it to help me sleep lately; trust me, this is a good thing.   
Seiyuu: There's nothing I can find wrong with this series, with regards to seiyuu.  There are only two real main seiyuu, the ones for Hermes and Kino.  They do sound similar, but I kind of like that.  I'm not really sure why, either.  ^^; 
Dub: N/A, because I've never seen it.  ^^; 
Length: This is the one area where the series suffers. 
First off, there's the fact of episode placement.  Because all of these episodes are one-shots, there's no real order they have to go in (except for the last episode, really, which can't be moved).  I found the placement of some episodes to be poor, because some of the weaker episodes, story-wise, came after some really strong ones, and I didn't like them as much as I might have, were they placed somewhere else in the series. 
This series gives you just a short dip into this world; these thirteen episodes leave you wanting more.  And they have yet to announce a second season, though one movie has been released, and a second one is slated to be released this April.  The source material is on-going, and the anime itself only covered a fraction of the original story, so they don't have too much of an excuse for making it as short as it was. 
Overall: An excellently-written, if slightly short and kind of poorly-planned series, with characters you bond with, and beautiful art and music.

Another harem, ecchi, romance, school, mecha, sci-fi and action anime has just ended,........I'd never understand as to why two top reviews of this anime give this anime a -- over this simulated porn anime? Nevertheless, here were my ratings: 
Storywise, just another sci-fi anime where being from another world comes and threatens humanity and it's up to some individuals with such capabilities, as those otherworldly beings has and that's the plot which is the same as another anime being aired at the same season, Scared Rider Xechs, so plotwise they maybe the same , but Scared Rider Xech has more sensible story plot that this one, where everything was just about them girls getting molested by a guy or one of their own , which is why this category is a - over --.  
Art, I gave it an - over -- and as a guy I need not tell you.......Ok, so I admit , the porn thingy got to me and the boobs. 
Sound, I gave it a - over --, since I just feel like it.....and I kinda like the climax (a bit) while them girls were being done by the guy. 
Character, let's see, we have the quintessential, tsudere, samurai girl, and big boob American bimbo and a guy who has to do them in order to boost them up......oh and there is the quintessential loli, that the guy also done. The rest were just whores for fantasizing, like Scarlet and her bitches and The last boss and her legion of Batlantis whores, so it's a - over --.  
Enjoyment, ok so an - over --, the same reason as the ""Art"" category. 
Overall, If they're gonna make a season - of this, maybe studio Production IMS should think again, since this anime was all about boobs, orgasm and simulated porn, so overall, its a pathetic - over --. So, no to season -. 
EROS!!!!!!!!!

Wow. I know that a lot of people consider Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherood as one of the greatest animes ever, and now that I watched it, I understand why. 
This show has got everything. 
Beautiful story, amazingly developed characters, solid soundtrack, perfect animations... You just can't deny the fact that Brotherhood is a masterpiece. Some people say that this show is overrated, but believe me, it's not. It deserves all the praise it gets, because I have never seen an entertaining, interesting and never-boring show like this in my life. In my opinion, it's easily one of the greatest anime ever made. If you have the opportunity, just watch it, you will not be disappointed.

Death Note is a Japanese manga series created by writer Tsugumi Ohba and manga artist Takeshi Obata which was adapted into an anime and directed by Araki, Tetsurou and produced by Maruyama, Masao. It centers on Light Yagami, a high school student who discovers a supernatural notebook, the titular ""Death Note"" or “Desu Noto”. This notebook grants the ability to kill anyone whose name is written. The series follows Light's subsequent efforts to create a criminal-free world using this extra ordinary notebook, and the efforts of a detective known as L or (Lawliet L.) to stop him. 
Death Note was first serialized in --- chapters by Shueisha in the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December ---- to May ----. The anime series aired October -, ----, to June --, ----. Consist of -- episodes. 
Death Note brings you to the mood of critical thinking and intelligence, which will make you think over and over again. 
It has a great plot that insures you to get your characters from Point-A to Point-Z.  
Creating a new world with your own hands isn't fair enough, bringing up the fact that no one has the right to judge anyone and that what is Desu Noto is all about.  Story relation with its own viewer is really epic; it permits you to solve the puzzle first before it reveals what really happens in the series. 
This is a good example of what is psycho thriller was all about. 
Exceptional art for Death Note was implemented resulting into a masterpiece series when it comes to anime &amp; character illustration. Supposed to be that the anime story is in a classic theme still the latest art was implemented in a really nice way, also I love the art for some scenes when Yagami Light is talking to himself where he turns to be a red colour Yagami. Not only that, Lawliet L was the highlight for this series (for me) when it comes to the art section. 
Sound, there’s nothing really special here as usual hardcore music are being implemented when it comes to psycho and supernatural series. The one that caught my attention here are the voice actors/actresses they did a great job to personalize and to illustrates the visualization for each character. Lawliet L. was the most impressive here when it comes to voice acting. Performed by (Japanese) voice actor Yamaguchi Kappei.  
About the character well, I've already said it earlier that characters are impressive either personalization &amp; visualization. Each of them has a unique characteristic. Let say for example, Lawliet L. the way he moves is really strange and very intriguing, answering the phone and reading something in an unusual way spiced up the whole series. This also applies to “Near” as well which are very entertaining. 
Well I really enjoyed this one, the fact that you are also involved with the story spice you up on what is going to happen next. You might get to the point that you want to play it in a fast forward mode. 
So overall I gave it a mark of -/--, which means it is almost perfect to me, because I've never scored --/-- as many of us would not agree since we have our own preferences. 
Want to improve my review? Please comment your feedback on how to improve my review methods as I am reviewing this one based on my opinions only. 
JA! Domo!

Its just a shitty version of Nisekoi but devoid of actual humor and with unrelatable characters. 
--% of the audience can in no way relate to the protagonist. He is a good looking rich kid that works out every day and watches what he eats. 
The female lead is just a bitch with no redeeming qualities. 
The jokes, if thats what you would call them, fail to deliver. 
The plot is just a cliche romance that you can see from a mile away starting on the first episode. 
The fan service is completely unnecessary where it is introduced because it doesn't make sense for the character that is doing it. 
Go watch Nisekoi instead for an infinitely better version of this show.

Where to begin with Tokyo Ghoul. I would personally class this as one of my most enjoyable anime mainly because it was a unique show for the Horror and Psychological genres. 'Unique' because it seems to try something different when it comes to how the characters are developed and how the story is put together.  
The story for me personally is somewhat an emotionally psychological thrill ride mainly because of how each individual character is structured leaving me as a watcher emotionally invested to the point of sitting on the edge of my seat as each part of the story takes a serious twist.  
When it comes to art however, I am clueless. Despite my clueless understandings of the average anime artwork, I can say that the artwork is great and colourful. It has a unique and beautiful colour scheme along with the brilliantly designed features of the show.  
As stated above, I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of this show because I can actually get emotionally invested. However, I do dislike the weak male lead of Kaneki. Every other character is all good in my books. 
Overall, for me, Tokyo Ghoul is one hell of a special anime. For those wishing to get emotionally invested in the story, invested in the character or even just want a solid gore show, I personally recommend watching it.

They've added narrations to this, which makes the whole story telling less and less immersive, and while on it, why not let the man from the intro narrate? Most narrators (they used more than one) sounds overly calming. 
Story wise I've got nothing to say, although it's not super predictable like in the -rd season, this time, it's just way too random. The episodes are already - minutes short with an intro and ED, there's no proper build-up. It's simply not as creepy as the first two seasons, that has the effect to chill you to the core. 
Also pretty sad about the lack of perspective artwise. (simple close ups and full/half body view mostly)

Kokoro connect can and most likely will have a profound affect on many people. Kokoro literally means Heart; Mind; Mentality; Emotions; and Feeling. The connection of all those personal things being shared between - friends. All of this leading to them to either becoming closer to each other or losing faith in them. 
The story is something of a hit and miss with me. The Story is very slow paced, each arc lasting - to - episodes. With each ending of an arc having lasting affects on a future one. Swapping bodies, Uncontrollable Impulses, Age regression, and finally Telepathy of inner feelings. Each of these being a Catalyst for a specific characters story arc. The reason for my Hit and miss comment is that they didn't delve nearly deep enough into Taichi's psyche. I had to go back after i finished to remember why he feel like an Outcast. Overall though the story will make you remember, people will always have more than one side to them regardless how close you may be to them. 
At the start of Kokoro I thought the Art was terribly sloppy for the -st arc. But I was glad i stuck with it because it either grew on me, or perhaps is was that it matched the more comical side of body swapping, or maybe it just got better. I don't know. The characters aren't exactly eye catching either. Though I think it's better this way, just for fact that the characters have such colorful personalities, if they were drawn an any other way it would of taken something from that. 
Kudos to the Japanese cast, there wasn't a single time in the whole show where i would do anything different. Double Kudos to you Heartseed you creeped me the hell out every time you spoke. The BGM isn't anything thing to sneeze at either, during some of the more intense scenes it worked really well. 
Finally to the Character god i wish i could make this an --. Each character is so well fleshed out that its almost criminal. The only person you don't really get to know is Heartseed but hes played so well it's forgivable. Whether a Character is so scared to the point of hiding herself in there room because she can't control themselves or someone so stressed out with worry they get sick, it's all shown to great affect. It's hard to hate any of the characters for to long just for the fact that Heartseed has such a hold on them you can almost feel the stress you would go through if you had to deal with it. I guess an a way I would of liked Taichi to be a little bit more broken. Just for the fact that everyone else has so much going on, he seems kind of out of place. 
Besides the slight issues with me getting into the show due to the art, this will always stick with me where ever i go. I will most likely be getting this on DVD in the future and read some of the Light novels just because i want to spend a little more time with these characters. 
So yes to Watch, Yes to Rewatch, and Yes to supporting it creator.

I knew I had to check this one out after watching the trailer. It's as everyone says, Kimi to Boku with Nichijou's humor and style. Gags are real...hilarious. Incidentally, Tadakuni is Kimi to Boku's Chizuru (seiyuu), Yoshitake is Gintama's Sougo, and Hidenori, Gintama's Gintoki (that mad funny gag anime, too)!!! I recognized those voices right off the trailer. The vocal talents just fit in well the characters. I'm looking forward to this show, more made of laughter moments to come. Another Sambaka (Those Three (Idiot) Guys) is born!

This review contains minor plot spoilers. View at your own discretion. 
Post modernism is an art movement that seeks to deconstruct and subvert existing pre-cognitions of modern art. I feel that the first half of Sleeping with Hinako is a post-modernist masterpiece. While the second half of Hinako is an offense to the viewer as much as it is a complete betrayal and reconstruction of the theme it tried so hard to explore and critiqued. In fact, it wouldn't surprised me if both halves were written by different people. 
For post modernism to exist, it has to be compared to a modernist work. For Hinako, this means that in order to properly judge and review it, one must compare it to a modernist work that Hinako was made in response to, this being of course the Slice of Life Genre of anime prevalent through the late ----s/early ----s. Hinako brilliantly subverts the themes commonly explored in Slice of Life by portraying the events that occur generally in those anime in a realm which may seem normal in a regular anime, but contradicts the general elements and common sense once one thinks and analyses each scene through and through. It is the Campbell Soup Cans in an art gallery, it makes a mockery of those anime by making us, the viewer, witness and participate in the act of sleeping with the main heroine. 
Te first half also evokes great works of yore such as Auguste Rodin's ""The Thinker"". You are not meant to know Hinako's thoughts as she is dreaming. These details are kept away from the audience in order for a more immersive experience in which the audience asks themselves as to what dream Hinako may be thinking of. However, ultimately it does not and may not matter what dream she thinks about, as it ultimately doesn't matter much, a dream is ultimately a dream, and her future actions, and by extension the viewers futures actions do not means much in terms of the future. Indeed, it poses the philosophical question of does choice ultimately matter in out lives, seeing as how insignificant each person is in the grand scheme of the Universe. 
The fact that Hinako can be analysed and this gives the viewer a huge amount of interaction and freedom to interpret it to their own will is indeed innovative and unheard of in other more conventional anime. It reminds me of Metal Gear Solid - in a way, where the author deliberately set up false expectations for its viewers in order to deliver a separate message by subverting expectations of the viewer. 
That was the first half, if it all ended there, then Hinako wod be a definite --/-- anime from me, but alas, perhaps due to Executive Meddling, the second half is a complete reversal and betrayal of the first half so much that it completely destroys the experience. 
The second half occurs as the viewer finally is able to peek into Hinako's mind and view her dream, the otherwise peaceful atmosphere is completely destroyed and a plot is finally established, ruining the multiple viewpoints and multiple interpretations outlook the first half was going for. The viewer is directly addressed more often, however, it becomes apparent that the viewer is also a canonical entity in the story. We can assume that the ""viewer"" referred to in the second half may be a poltergeist or some sort, an entity only Hinako can see, like elves or hedgehogs.  
It also betrays the goal of the anime. The anime's title is ""Sleeping with Hinako"", however Hinako doesn't sleep in the second half much, she entices the viewer to perform innate vapid acts with her such as singing and trying to sleep (oh the irony), before falling asleep herself. It becomes apparent that free will is stripped entirely from the viewer, and the only way to win is to not watch the anime at all. 
In conclusion, this anime is cruel and offensive to me, in which a cruel painful joke is played to the audience, where the punchline is wasted potential this anime could have offered.  
I'm afraid this anime only deserves one of the very few -/-- ratings I rarely give to anime.  
You'd accomplish more by actually sleeping.

(This has been adapted from my reddit thread) 
War, when diminished to its base components, is sadly tragic. It's hard to justify the killings of thousands of people for any kind of cause. But some are better than others: bringing about peace, saving a subjugated group, or protecting one's home. For as long as humans have lived, war has not only shaped the past, has not only persisted in the present, but will most likely never dwindle in the future. An almost inevitability, war brings out the best and the worst in people. For Madan no Ou to Vanadis, it certainly brings out the worst in something. 
STORY 
Vanadis begins with the bowman Tigre meeting Elen, a War Maiden, on the battlefield. After being taken hostage, the two decide to help one another in protecting Tigre's hometown of Alsace. 
At its core, the show is about war: the battles, the aftereffects, the planning, and the formations. And to this end, it fails miserably. A lot of this has to do with the world-building it attempts to employ. Country names, nearby towns, and faraway lands are talked about as if the audience is supposed to simply know that such areas exist. It disconnects the viewer from what is going on, because he or she just cannot follow who's from where, which side is fighting what, and why they're all fighting in the first place. Simultaneously, multiple sub-plots exist at any given moment, such as Elen's trek to visit Sasha or the King's madness. The aforementioned difficulty in understanding what is going on persists here as well. Since it wasn't explained properly before, it remains discombobulated after. 
When it comes to the actual field skirmishes, the anime adopts a narration approach. Going into explanatory mode, the show does its best to clarify the formations of the warring sides and their plan of attack. The point here is to make it feel as if it's a war that the characters are participating in. Again, though, it falls flat: the majority of the action focuses not on the entire battle, but on the singular duels taking place. Elen fighting against a dragon or Tigre squaring off against the opposing general are fine as standalone fights. In context, though, it doesn't seem to fit since their part is just one small piece to the much bigger puzzle. 
When the anime isn't having such a tough job conveying the severity of the wars going on, it steps back into its secondary role as a harem. Once again, though, the anime cannot deliver. A lot of the problems here stem from the show refusing to address or at least elaborate on the relationships that exist between Tigre and the rest of the girls. It's alluded to heavily for each of them, with constant teasing and wordplay, but it never comes off as if the characters are anything but friends to our main character. What's even more strange is the apparent lack of the harem. Particular characters are sometimes shown only once or twice, despite given relative importance. Worse still, there exists a person shown in the opening and closing sequences, but never appears over the course of the show. It's almost as if the anime forgot to include her during production. 
Amid the directionless wars and harem antics, the show gives one final attempt to instill some form of reason. The idea that a just cause is a righteous one. Fighting for others and not yourself is noble and courageous, to say the least. And this isn't just seen with Tigre; many of his opponents question their beliefs, and many of the War Maidens aid him not for themselves, but because they simply wish to help. It's entirely poetic, though, since it's never challenged nor is it looked at realistically. It's accepted as fact that Tigre's mindset is ""as straight as an arrow,"" and that nothing could be more worthy of praise. The show fails to explore any kind of ramifications attributed to such thinking, instead directing its resources to other venues. 
ANIMATION 
The art and animation fair no better for Vanadis. 
The art style at first gives the feeling of taking place within an Elder Scrolls type fantasy world, with taverns, villages, and zero modern technology. However, this is quickly replaced by the reused open terrains with overcast clouds and tent encampments. Combined with the quite jarring CG horses and platoons, it's never pretty to see. 
The character designs pick up some of the slack. While Tigre is rather boring with his outfit and hair, the same cannot be said for the War Maidens. While some have excessively large busts, they're all quite beautiful. Each of their designs is detailed, from their armor to their weapons. Even some of the men receive this treatment, appearing as menacing and barbaric. Everyone also has a slight sheen to their faces, with lighted eyes, making them feel a bit more alive. 
The actual animation dips back down in quality, sadly. The choreography for the fights isn't difficult to follow so much as it is just non-existent. Arrows regularly fly from off-screen, swords are swung wildly, and the dragon abilities characters have are not impressive, no matter how much screaming is done. Being ecchi, the breasts are given special attention when the girls move, but that is usually the extent of character movements, both in and out of battle. 
CHARACTERS 
Harem or not, the characters of Vanadis are completely one-dimensional, signified by either a single trait or the size of their chests. 
Tigrevurmud -- known as Tigre -- is a ""prisoner"" to Elen and the leader of their joint forces. Embodying the spirit of his people, his aim in war is to make sure that it never again reaches his home of Alsace. Kind to all who approach him, he is respected by his soldiers and loved by the women around him. Never emotional, underdeveloped, and overpowered from start to finish, he is as typical and generic as they come. His only purpose in the story is to be there for the harem to be created, and nothing more. 
As Tigre's maid, Titta dotes on him --/-. Quick to cry and unable to keep from shouting his name every other sentence, her presence serves literally nothing but Tigre. She seems to have some form of relevancy early on, spurring her master into action, but afterwards, the focus shifts from home to the wars abroad. Subsequently, Titta is lost in the process. While she is merely happy to be by Tigre's side, her place on the totem pole is low and forgotten, and no amount of niceties will change it. 
As cold as the ice she wields, Mila is initially an antagonist towards the group. As the ""tsundere"" in the harem, she makes it difficult for anyone, not just Tigre, to get a good read on her. Short in stature and always direct, she lets her actions do the talking for her. Perhaps uncharacteristically, she has a love and sense of duty to her house, much like the man she falls for. A rival to Elen both in love and war, she constantly butts heads with her fellow War Maiden. Despite having her outer shell melted slightly by Tigre's convictions, she remains largely uninteresting the whole ride through. 
The only other notable character is found in Elen. Ruler of Leitmeritz, she is confident both in her body and in battle. Playful with others yet quick to get jealous, she's rational and emotional at just the right moments. She believes the most in Tigre's cause, willing to trust both his bow and his words. Unfortunately, she is resigned to the same problem as the harem leader; never seeing any semblance of change, outlook, or personal insight, she becomes just another girl to ogle. 
Outside of these four, the rest of the cast are entirely inconsequential to anything that goes on within the anime. And that doesn't say anything about their characterization. Sure, the War Maidens see their personalities mirrored in the weapons they wield (Elen is whimsical like the wind, Elizavetta is electric, etc.), but no one amounts to anything more or are barely touched upon. Like the wars they participate in, their lives and their characters are expendable. 
SOUND 
Arguably, the OP is the best part of the entire anime. It begins as a choir, followed by a calming vocalist supported by background singing. The halfway point introduces a really catchy, drum-and-vocal beat that is very easy to follow. The ending brings about an epic feeling that should have been present throughout the show, but is unexpectedly absent. 
The ED is serene, with soft piano and slow vocal arrangement. It picks up in tempo and range the further the song goes, giving off a triumphant feeling that can accompany war, depending on the outcome. 
The soundtrack contains nothing notable. With low drum pieces, eerie tones, and resounding trumpets, the tracks fit their respective scenes without providing anything of merit. 
Voice acting sees average to below average work all around, with no notable performances to be had. 
ENJOYMENT 
The argument with this one is the fact that it not only is a harem but is also ecchi in nature. Ecchi, though, isn't even fair to the genre. Those moments are spaced too far apart and are nearly all unoriginal. Like everything else, it tries to make these events fun and sexy, but it can't seem to come off as anything but lame. 
Its comedy is not funny, the drama is forced, and the character interactions are weak. It's a mixture of sludge that one has to wade through during the entire season, with the reward being a modicum of boobs and uneventful clashes. 
Madan no Ou to Vanadis is a special show. Not because of the wars it contains, not because of its lackluster characters, and not even because of its failed fan-service. It's because it will forever sit at the bottom of the pile. 
SUMMARY 
Story: Terrible, abysmal world-building, failed harem, lost message 
Animation: Bad, repetitive art, nice character designs, low actual animation 
Characters: Terrible, everyone involved is inconsequential 
Sound: Bad, good OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, below average VA work 
Enjoyment: Terrible, almost zero redeeming qualities 
Final Score: -/--

Usually when I see a loli on the anime poster, I would expect cuteness overload out of the anime, even if it's about war or those gritty things, as apparent in ""Girls und Panzer"" and ""Gakkougurashi!"". But this show is completely different. From the first episode, you are treated with a psychotic smile, from the one and only loli--Tanya. Tanya is certainly one of the more interesting characters I have seen from this season. As you are watching this series, you travel through the trials and tribulations of a god denying girl, and her wish for a better life. I say it's really an enjoyable ride. The show really gets into the Tanya's thoughts, her motivations and reasons. I also like how the show handles it's tone: it's dark and horrid, but there's also these short breaks where it allows the viewers to experience light-hearted humor. This makes the characters feel really human. I have watched - episodes so far and I think that this is a must-watch of this season.

These short episodes came with the original videos and star Amano and Noriko as they educate the viewer on the science and history of their universe. Episodes are devoted to the science behind warping, the Space Monsters, and other topics with the average two minute running time utilized well. The scientific explanations can get surprisingly dense, but following them isn't exactly rewarding as some or all of what it says is going to be fictional. Still, the care that has gone into these explanations is admirable and makes the Gunbuster world more respectable. Hideaki Anno would go on to combine super robot and real robot concepts in Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
These shorts didn't make me like Gunbuster any more than I did before but they're worth a watch and have a few silly moments.

okay, talking the anime beck here. what really stands out for me is the Japanese music and dialogue. you know, everyone going to school in Japan learns English in school, but very few grow up to use it meaningfully. in the music world, it's different, because a J-band knows the importance of  American music as an influence, and they often try English lyrics, as you hear in beck. plus, you get to hear the seiyuu have whole conversations in English, whereas in most anime, the characters throw around a couple words, at the most. I found the whole series a refreshing change from the mainstream. give it a try.

Perhaps you wanted a better conclusion, perhaps you're a completionist. Whatever your reason may be for watching this OVA, you will soon find that you were mistaken from the start. Mirai Nikki is not only filled with betrayals, but it is betrayal in and of itself. This OVA is its final betrayal to you, the hapless viewer.  
So, this OVA kicks things off with that camera girl groping the tomboy girl's breasts at the beach. Every anime needs at least one filler episode at the beach filled with fanservice, right? How foolish we were to think this could be an exception! Meanwhile, Yuno is feeling something is missing in her life. She has flashbacks of Yukiteru and she has an inexplicable longing for him.  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it! Not the damn plot holes again! 
-. This is world -. World - Yuno. In the story's timeline, her parents are still alive and she has thusly never met Yukiteru. This is the Yuno who was going to be murdered and replaced - the whole fucking basis of everything. 
-. She should not have any memories of world -'s Yukiteru. They have nothing to do with each other and they never spent any time together! 
-. There is a Yukiteru in world -. Why wouldn't there be? Seriously, what the fuck? Why did they just write him off? If she feels like she's forgotten anyone, it should be him, not the Yukiteru she could not have possibly met! Yuno -'s memories are confined to Murmur's red crystal - there is no reason why they should be leaking into Yuno -'s head. 
Overall, this is nothing but fanservice and a convenient happy ending for world -'s Yukiteru (while disregarding um... everything else). Not just ecchi type fanservice, but simply fanservice in that it shows us all of the characters throughout the series for the sake of letting us see them. Uh... except for that punk with the pompadour, for some reason they excluded him even though he was one of the only decent characters. It seems he is also no longer in a relationship. Why? He was supposed to meet his girlfriend what, like -- years ago? How did changing the events of - years ago change that at all? Seriously.  
This OVA adds nothing to the series - it basically only cheapens it further. Whoever said THIS OVA IS AMAZING is obviously biased. Turn back before it's too late. )-::: 
Mirai Nikki Redial? Let's just Mirai Nikki Hang Up Since I have Call Display.

""The perception of others form my true self"" - I believe this quote holds great meaning to the creator of Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
Intro: This is one of the most debated anime in history, some claim it embodies a large number of hidden messages while others claim it is just another immature series that holds no deeper meaning. 
I believe Neon Genesis Evangelion covers many themes and discussions and succeeds in uniting them in one show. 
Story: -/-- 
The story of Neon Genesis Evangelion is not original and yet it is so complex and intriguing, having many lessons and hidden messages. The insertion of certain psuedo-philosophical concepts and other religious concepts gave great originality to the story thus what was a generic ""save mankind"" story line became a psychological analysis of the characters.  
The largest problem posed by the plot was the creator's intent to converge numerous perspectives, themes, symbologies and messages into one single show, the creator achieved that goal to a certain degree but he did not truly succeed. 
The plot revolves around the young man Shinji who will become one of the most important factors in deciding the survival of the human race thorugh piloting the robot ""Eva Unit --"". While the story prior to episode -- was nothing special and actually a bit generic and predictable, the subsequent episodes were great, they merged multiple themes and analyzed the characters to a deeper level. 
There are quiet a lot of ""coincidences"" and flaws in the story and I will list some of them: 
-. The origins and workings of the ""Angels"" are not explained very well, leaving the viewer somewhat confused. 
-. Religious symbologies were used throughout the show and they were often misused, being based on the creator's interpretation of them rather than religious perspectives. 
-. The agels used to attack every couple of days but when Shinji was missing for one entire moth no Angels attacked the city. 
-. When Nerve was facing the Angel in space, they realized the Evas could not shoot that far so they decided to throw a lance at the Angel. Where is the logic in that, to throw farther than you can shoot? 
-. This Kaji character is ridiculous. All women like him and act like he is the last man on earth. 
-. At times, the story is predictable. For instance, when I found out that Eva were beings derived from merging humans with an angels I predicted that Shinji's mother was part of Unit -. 
-. Most of the angels were dull, except for the one with the ability to creat an alternate dimension. 
Characters: -/-- 
This is where Neon Genesis Evangelion did not shine, the creation and immense development of Shinji's character made the show loose focus from the rest of the cast. The characters are fairly well portayed each one of them having something to distinguish them from the others. 
Some people seek power, some seek love, some seek happiness, some seek apreciation, some seek meaning to their actions and some seek absolute truth. In the final two episodes we discover everyone's desire. 
Shinji is not your typical hero protagonist, he is not courageous, handsome or intelligent, in fact he oftens considers and describes himself as being worthless. Although some would argue that Shinji is overly emotional, acts cowardly, seeks attention and pitty to the point he becomes annoying I consider him to be one of the most believable, sympathetic and well built protagonists in all anime. 
Ayanami, on the surface she is an emotionless and indiferent girl but deeper she is just lonely, a ""me and my shadow"" type of character who is often questioning what means to be alone and what is the purpose of life. 
Misato is a middle aged woman that somehow ended up occupying a high ranking position inside Nerve's ranks. She dose not have any distinctive skills nor is she particulary intelligent. Misato is portayed as a mess of a woman with no clea goal in life except for ""killing angels"", she is also portayed as being an easygoing girl who is ashamed about some of her past. In the end it is shown that she made those actions out of loneliness. 
Asuka is a german highly intelligent girl who is having psychological issues regarding her mother. Asuka is an entitled little brat who is constantly overeacting, hysterical and seeking the attention of older man, getting upset everytime something does not go according to her expectations. 
Animation: -/-- 
The animation and art are decent, it is clear that the show was on a tight budget.  
I personally did not expect or care much for the animation but even with it being not so good, the creators succeeded in making it fit the tone of the show. 
Sound: -/-- 
The opening theme is gorgeous, the ending theme is very good and the background music does its job very well. The voice actors have pleasant and suggestive voices that give the characters a personality. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Overall I enjoyed the series, mostly the later half. The episodes prior to -- were cheesy and dull but the episodes that followed were truly great, intriguing and engaging, i highly, highly enjoyed those. 
Overall: -.-/-- 
Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the strongest anime ever produced, it features powerful characters and an intriguing deep story. I recommend this series, it is a ""must watch"".

tl;dr: I find this show to be generic, cliche and tropy. The characters behave more like generic anime characters than real people, which negatively impacts the political story line. The dialog is awkward and stilted, while consistently using the crutch of explaining everything as a form of constant exposition. The themes regarding destiny/fate are confused and many of the situations are hard to swallow as believable.  
I recognize that this show is very popular and well liked, which is why I was originally interested in watching this show. I love ---- Nights and the aesthetic that goes with it, so it seemed like a good fit for me. I have actually watched this show before, when the season was first released and decided to read most of the manga (before ultimately dropping it), but my feelings on the show are... complex. I wish there were a rating for just ""setting"" as that is really the only thing I actually like about this anime. I find that the later storylines pick up some of the slack and the story DOES improve somewhat, but not within this season. 
As far as shounen anime go, this is a fine place for any shounen fans to go. I would say that it's in league with shows like Naruto or Dragon Ball. That is, however, as far as my recommendation goes. I imagine that if I had watched this as a kid, I would have loved the anime. It has a great inspiration, the setting is interesting, and it has all those shounen gimmicks for an action/adventure show that any kid would love. If you are looking for a shounen series, this show is passable.  
However, I wasn't looking for a shounen series, I think I was looking for something more a long the lines of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood in quality. I don't particularly like shounen as an adult and I don't think that this show does anything to escape the trappings of the genre. I also, fundamentally disagree with the idea that anime should continue to follow these tired and obnoxious tropes. I don't think that ""shounen"" is an excuse for cliche. 
The characters are pretty basic anime tropes that do nothing to escape that trapping. They are the same characters you have seen in a hundred anime. The show itself is cliche, predictable, tropy and it does nothing to separate itself from every other shounen. I am actually shocked that this series has such high ratings, because of just how unambitious it is. It is sterotypical anime down to its core. The dialog is awkward at best and absurd at worst. People don't talk or behave like people, they behave like parodies of anime characters. I find the dialog and writing to be embarrassing and cringy; I haven no other words to describe it. You have people CONSTANTLY explaining what they are doing, as if the audience is too stupid to figure it out. It runs into that issue where battles come to a complete stop so that the characters can narrate what they are doing, which is unnecessary and something I particularly hate. It violates the classic concept of ""show, don't tell"" every chance it gets. Possibly due to translation, but the dialog itself comes off as incredibly unnatural. Not just because they are constantly explaining what's happening, but because the show seems more interested in fulfilling shounen check boxes than it does illustrating a believable world, inspired by ---- nights. The characters, their actions, and the way they talk are all ridiculous and in some instances, unbelievable. The villains are so petty and obvious that it's impossible to take them seriously. The heroes are just... anime heroes.  
The story itself is passable. It's nothing special and only works because of the interesting setting that the writer put together. I love the ideas of dungeons and Magi and the Arabic aesthetic. However, I think the presence of sterotypical anime characters and ridiculous plot tropes really only drags the compelling setting down. You have these political scenarios, which sound interesting on paper, but are executed to a degree of absurdity. These nations don't behave or interact like real world nations, they behave and act like, well, anime characters. In shows like Gurren Laggan, it works, because of how wonderfully absurd and stylized the story is. In this, they try to play it too straight for it to be believable. Compare it to the political events of central in Fullmetal Alchemist or the tense political scenario of --th MS Team. In the latter, the political situation is believable, consistent, and has a thread of realism that makes the situations feel dire and tense. In Magi, it just feels... made up. There are multiple moments in the show that just seem overly simplistic and unlikely.  
Beyond the fact that I find this show to be intensely generic, unrealistic, and cliche, Magi is also built around some ridiculous themes regarding destiny. Without spoiling anything, the end of the first season builds up this theme that I just cannot get behind. The themes of Magi are only believable within the context of the show and are not translatable to reality. That is at least, if you take the story in the first season at face value. I think that the themes become more reasonable in the second series, as more information is provided, but at the very least I would say that themes are confused. Specifically, I am referring to the show's position on the concept of fate. The theme honestly feels inconsistent, which leads to this conflicting opinion on it. There are moments in the show that almost seem to imply that ""going against fate is bad"", which is ridiculous and one reason I detest the show. But... then the actual mechanics of the concepts of fate become fleshed out and the theme begins to take a turn. But I would almost argue that the inconsistent perspective of faith has more to do with providing the good guys opportunities to be in the right, rather than any solid stance on the concept. Either way I find the themes to range from dumb at worst to confused at best.  
At the end of the day, this show is just another shounen anime that doesn't do anything to evolve the genre. There are too many anime that use shounen tropes as skeleton to make something unambitious, cliche, and generic. I don't like these tropes and they hold the genre back. Just because an adventure series is aimed at young adults, doesn't mean that they have to tell the same stories and characters over and over again. There are better shows that do way more with the medium.

At the time of this writing, Spirited Away is ranked #- among anime movies on this site.  In my opinion, that is sorely inaccurate.  Reading the reviews for it, there are a lot of remarks about the excellent animation and soundtrack (rightfully so) and the strong character design (understandably so), but beyond that, the praise begins to falter.  People struggle to justify the disjointed nature of the film, sometimes going with ""shows remarkable creativity"" and sometimes just falling back on ""makes me nostalgic.""  Viewers who liked it don't know why they liked it, and that doesn't surprise me. 
In short, Spirited Away feels like a three hour recreation of someone's dream that was carelessly edited down to two hours for the sake of runtime.  For starters, the movie has no true plot.  Chihiro (the protagonist) has lost her parents in a spirit world and needs to get them back and escape.  With that as a distant theme, the movie proceeds to throw characters and situations at us that are only tangentially connected to each other or that goal. 
Are there high points along the way? Absolutely.  The animation far surpasses the usual anime standard.  The musical composition is excellent.  The characters are unique and well-defined.  Everything is vivid and bombastic and well-done...except for an actual STORY. 
I'm afraid the only way to properly explain my issue is with specific examples from the film, so there are spoilers ahead.  You've been warned. 
Let's start with Chihiro's helper and guide, so to speak: Haku.  You begin to get an impression that he's someone like her - someone who got lost in the spirit world but managed to survive by becoming Yubaba's assistant.  He helps Chihiro get on her feet and avoid trouble, and then promptly ceases to be anything more than a plot device.  Haku steals a trinket from Yubaba's sister for a reason that's both not fully explained and ultimately irrelevant.  Yubaba's sister is angry enough to try to kill him, then just forgives him when the trinket is returned.  He promptly loses any interest in taking it again, remembers he's a water spirit (...okay?), and that's the last we hear about him. 
How about No-Face? An interesting character, absolutely, but pointless overall.  Yes, there's a scene where he helps Chihiro, but after that, he eats a bunch of people, spits them out, and becomes a seamstress.  Fun. 
Characters don't so much ""develop"" as they change into completely different people for the sake of the story.  People hate Chihiro...until they don't.  There's a baby that cries and throws fits because he's worried about the germs outside...then he goes outside willingly and becomes a nice person.  The witches are angry one moment and friendly the next. 
And then there are all the little inconsistencies and allowances made for the sake of making the story work (or forgotten when it no longer matters).  For example, there's a big deal made about the importance of names and how losing your name is losing your identity, but it's only relevant for two characters: Chihiro and Haku.  Chihiro forgets her name but then sees it on a card and remembers it again.  Haku makes a big deal about how she needs to hang onto that card so she'll always remember...and then it's never touched on again.  Haku can't remember his original name, and this is treated as significant, but then Chihiro figures it out for him and exactly nothing comes of it. 
Simply put, this is a mess of a movie that nonetheless gets praise because it's presented well.  Perhaps I just don't have the context to really understand it (for example, maybe there are lots of details I didn't catch because I'm not familiar with Japanese culture or mysticism), but from my perspective, as someone who appreciates a good, coherent plot, Spirited Away fell utterly flat.

Akira is my favorite movie of all time, including non-animated movies. I will be up front and say this is not my reaction from watching this movie for the first time. Watching this movie for the first time can be confusing and when the movie ends you might be asking yourself what did I just watch or what just happened? I think that's a reasonable response. Not everything about Akira makes perfect sense. I think to really appreciate this movie more though you have see it a few times and understand the context around the making of the film. When Katuhiro Otomo made this movie he was in the middle of writing the manga of the same title. The two works are connected in that the movie is a cut version of the manga. Key characters and subplots are missing from the film entirely. I think if you've read the manga series and seen the movie a few times you can really appreciate the movie more for what it is. 
First and foremost Akira is a work of art. The lighting and backgrounds are so incredibly detailed for an animated piece from the --'s. The coloring is vibrant when it needs to be and perfectly drab when the scene calls for it. A different reviewer called the whole movie drab but they must color blind so I'll let it slide. Neo-Tokyo (the setting of Akira) is supposed to be a drab place. It is a city that was built on the ruins of Tokyo and then consumed by technology available is a cyberpunk version of ----. The city is in turmoil due to protests and rioting and I think the coloring and lighting really highlight the city that is falling apart.  
The sound is superb in this movie. The original score ranges from epic to haunting at times. Each track matches the scene it goes with very well and helps set the mood perfectly. The opening scene with the motorcycle chase through the city has fast paced music that helps intensify the excitement of gangs tearing through a city and causing chaos. Outside of the soundtrack the sound is great as well. Motorcycles, gunshots, and psychic battles all sound great no matter how you're watching the movie. I'll briefly mention the dub and sub here as well. Personally I like both and will choose the dub or sub depending on the mood I am in. Overall I'd say the sub is better. In the dub a few lines in particular come off as jarring and unnatural but not badly enough to ruin the experience of watching the dub. As you can guess I don't care much for the sub vs dub debate.  
Most of the characters in this movie in my opinion are memorable even if I don't always remember their names. Obviously if you've read the manga a few times then you'll be very familiar with all of the characters present in the film as they do get more development in writing. The characters probably suffer the most in the movie because Otomo is trying to cram - mangas into a two hour gap. I think with what he had he did a great job. Do I think Akira should've been split into two movies or even a trilogy? No, while overall it would've been better it also would've lost the charm that the standalone movie has. Akira allows us to really focus on Kaneda and Tetsuo who are the most important characters to the story. We get the most development out of them and we come to understand why they behave the way they do throughout the film. As far as character design goes I think people are used to modern animation will find the people to look a little strange and a bit samey. I'd say this was probably done to save money because it looks like the budget really went into coloring, backgrounds, and lighting. It seems to me that Otomo wanted to show the audience what the world of Neo-Tokyo was like. Neo-Tokyo is a dangerous and frankly disgusting environment and you see that it creates delinquents like Kaneda and Tetsuo so what they look like doesn't matter as much.  
This is a movie that gets better with each viewing which I know can be difficult if you really didn't like it on the first viewing. I urge those who didn't like it to watch it again or read the manga. Say what you want but Akira was ahead of its time and would go on to inspire creators to make many more fantastic cyberpunk works like Ghost in the Shell.

Short and quick review: 
Ah here we go again, every season we find ourselves in this situation where an anime so mediocre with chracters so flat and bland it makes you wonder if you are ever going to see a SOL/romance/harem VN adaptation that doesn't suck. 
I assure you, you have indeed watched Island before, but you just can't remember when and where, just like the MC in this anime, he just can't seem to remember how many girls he has slept with, just flashbacks. Sad indeed. 
If you've watched any other mediocre trash of an anime, then rest assured that this one is no different, I've watched enough anime of this sort to safely say that this anime is not worth your time, unless you wish to see an MC which is slightly edgier than other harem anime MCs, then by all means go ahead, but you'll soon be disappointed by how generic the heroines are. 
Spoilers ahead:  
One of the female characters said 'Mess me up' by the end of Episode - to the MC and I see this as doing a great disservice to an anime that is already pathetic to the point where I just ended up dropping it - episodes in. At this point it's basically just using fanservice as bait. 
A good anime or rather any good story should make the audience understand what's going on as soon as the first episode ends. Sure, you may argue that great animes as such Steins Gate had a confusing start. However, what seperates Steins Gate from this anime in particular is that while we're unravelling the mystery with our MC, we have interesting characters to indulge in and also we get a gist of what's going on by the hints scattered in each episode, thus allowing us to formulate our own reasoning as to what is going on.  
But with Island, you get a mystery anime that quickly turned into a SOL anime that has no obvious direction, no idea what it is doing and even the chracters just felt like it's there as bait. Even after - episodes the anime has not clarified a lot of things and instead spends time shrouding Rinne, the main heroine, with an added layer of mystery. At this point you will soon realize that Rinne is just set up as a bigger bait to reel the audience in for just a couple more episodes before finally deciding that this show is just not worth their time.  
So, do we care about Rinne? Do we care about who the MC wants to kill? Do we care about the Island? 
No, no and no because we won't get any questions answered by the end of this anime. You're better off treating this anime as a SOL anime.

Listen, unless you're nostalgic about your youth, or feel as though you've done nothing with your life, this show is not for you. There is - awesome plot-line that is paid of splendidly, but the rest of it nearly bored me to tears. Its just a slice of life, and for me, this inspirational tone did not carry this show made of pure characterization. 
Story-work is fine. I dont really care for much of the plot (except - plot line) and so bored me. 
Art was pretty wonderful when it needed to be, but at times cause me nausea. Thats probably just me tho. 
Sound was really solid. 
Characters were ok. -/- main characters were so forgettable. 
I didnt really enjoy it much.

Legends of Legendary Heroes might be a enjoyable show if you find it early in your anime life. After that, it goes downhill fast. There's nothing in this show I haven't seen before. The characters are very bad, the writing is equally as terrible, and the action is rather poor.  
The story is centered around a protag who is having a tragic backstory competition with everyone he meets.  The story doesn't really go anywhere. In -- episodes we discover the actual plot in the very last episode. Kinda late to do anything with right? This is a anime adaptation. It was not adapted to be watchable. A mediocre story line, that barely finds its ass with both hands and a map, is only serviceable if the other elements make up for it. They did not. 
Art is art.  
It had sound. I remember that.  
Characters? I don't really have anything that fits that description in the show. There were these talking things that reused the same dialogue and jokes about ---- times, but those aren't characters. Characters are these magical things that have more than - responses. They also grow and learn as a result of experiences. It's a difficult concept to grasp. If done correctly characters would actually mimic humans and be relateable.  
This is perhaps the worst 'copy character' I have ever seen. He can copy and use whatever magic he sees. That's why he uses the exact same lightning spell the entire show. Copying is suppose to be a unique ability that makes a character interesting and give them multiple ways to overcome challenges. No. Keep using the same thing. I pity the world he lives in. A world of magic, cursed by a cruel god to only have one lightning spell. The fighting is truly forgettable.  
How am I suppose to enjoy this? Should I be laughing at the same reused jokes? I certainly didn't watch for the graphics or sounds. There's nothing here for me to like. 
Basically, this is a terrible show. If you find it early in your anime life watch it so you can see all the mistakes it makes. It's possible to get some enjoyment if you haven't seen many fantasy shows.

If you are like me you don't mind non-canonical movies. Especially within the Dragon Ball realm. You understand they cannot logically happen, but still enjoy them. This movie is a retelling of the first arc of Dragon Ball. It's not just a shortened down version of the television series. It takes tons of liberties with characters and progression points. 
With non-canonical movies you can enjoy them because they are their own thing. This isn't it's own thing though. It's just a worse version of the television series. The story moves to fast and no one really develops. The villain barely gets enough air time. The finale is mediocre. The voice acting (dub) is not as good (although it's not entirely terrible). 
I can't see any reason to watch this over the actual Dragon Ball series.

If any were to become a live action movie and or TV drama it would be Monster. Great story, great character development, great chase and a fantastic cast of voice actors. This show is not for everyone aimed towards a more for adult crowd. Some conversions are deep and there a lot of information to digest. ---+ episodes of Great writing (unlike this).  
Story:-- 
Art:- (their are must better looking anime out there) 
Characters:-- (Very deep set of characters) 
Overall:-- (Again not for everyone deep story and aim towards a more mature audience)

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
Also worth noting: this review is of both series because I dislike when anime feel the need to make a seperate series rather than just making a second season of the same anime. I feel like the distinction is somewhat arbitrary as someone who is watching it after all of it has come out. 
Let me begin with a quote from the show about the movie Haruhi was making that seemed too purposely place for it to not be talking about the show. I changed some of the words to better apply to the show rather than the movie, but the premise is the same. ""It's clear that [the writers don't] care about certain details like plot or foreshadowing I doubt that [they] have even come up with a proper ending [to the show] yet. who knows the [anime] might end unfinished."" 
Overall - -: 
This anime is a pathetic mess of a show, and here's why: you take a terrible cast of unlikeable character and make them do one of two things: nothing or save the world in some poorly explained and executed sequence of events. 
Plot - -: 
A story is allowed to be simple and it can still be great. A story can have a twist that changes what you thought the series would be like and it can still be great. A story can have elements that are unexplained or seemingly unpredictable and can still be engaging. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu had all these things and each one of them made the show that much worse. 
The anime starts off as a slice of life club anime, but it introduces some fantasy elements a bit into the story. By the time they do I've already started to dislike the anime quite a bit, but it was early enough that I was hopeful they would improve the story. I was wrong, so very wrong. 
The times they do have a more down to earth scene or episode it is just unbearably boring. They seriously had a scene that lasted for about a minute of Yuki sitting in the clubroom reading. That was it, nothing important at all happened. Even when more out there things are happening it remains boring or frustrating. 
Another big negative is the fact that the world literally revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya (which I'll get to later). But this means that really anything can happen and the explanation is ""our god Haruhi Suzumiya willed it"" 
Crazy eights was bad, but honestly I felt like it was only marginally worse than the rest of the show. Don't get me wrong it was completely stupid and had no reason to take as long as it did, but the base episode wasn't the worst one the could have kept repeating. 
Art - -: 
There were moments where I felt like the animation was pretty good. The scene that stands out in my mind is when Yuki was defending Kyon from the other alien. Otherwise it's kinda generic and not that good. I also took a point off because sometimes I couldn't tell if Kyon was talking, thinking or narrating. I'm not entirely sure where to put that since it could fall into story, art, or sound, but I put it here since that just means the shots weren't framed well. 
Sound - -: 
Nothing all that bad, I disliked Kyon's voice but I chose to watch the dub so it's whatever. I will take the time to make a note here though: Mediocre art and sound alone aren't enough to bring up the overall score of an anime. 
Character - -: 
Mikuru Asahina is the most whiny pathetic character I've seen in a while. Her whole character is being sexually abused for a joke and then crying about it. The literal only redeeming thing about her is her cooler future self who we only see very briefly, and who's character amounts to next to nothing. And the whole classified information thing wasn't all that funny the first time, and it didn't get better the more times she said it. 
Itsuki Koizumi is not too unpleasant, but he is guilty of being a yes man to Haruhi, honestly of all the characters he's probably the best. 
Kyon is the most monotone, boring and generic protagonist who has no motivation whatsoever to be a part of the SOS Brigade. He likes Mikuru because she's cute, and I think that's about it in terms of reason for him to go to the club. He does what Haruhi says, but at least he is quite annoyed by her. 
Yuki Nagato somehow manages to be even more monotone and boring than Kyon and really does next to nothing --% of the time. She is essentially not a character since she doesn't really want anything, and her only goal is to observe (which she probably could have done without being in the story). 
Haruhi Suzumiya is the worst character in this anime by far, which only makes the anime that much worse since it focuses on her the most, and how the story is essentially 'she is god, what she wills to happen happens'. Haruhi is a child, she does what she wants and gets upset when she doesn't get her way. This is just hard to watch, and it doesn't make for a funny scene. In addition to being completely immature she is also completely manipulative. Yuki she treats like an object quite a bit (and I know she kinda is, but Haruhi doesn't know that). Mikuru she abuses basically every episode, and has forced her into doing all sorts of things she doesn't want to do. She used Mikuru's body as a way to blackmail the computer club into giving them their best computer, without any care for Mikuru or the members of the computer club. And on top of all of that she's perfect in just about everything she does. She's good enough to make amazing grades with next to no effort, play any sport better than professionals in that field, and she can play a song on an instrument we've never seen her play before just by looking at the sheet music and practicing an hour beforehand. 
Another overall problem with the characters is that they never undergo any significant change, they're still the same boring or horrible characters that they were in the beginning of the story. 
Enjoyment - -: 
I hated this anime. There were only moments that I got a kick out of, but when those are surrounded by frustrating or boring scenes the rest of the time, it doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. I think I enjoyed the show most when it was talking meta about the show itself. I got a kick out of the time Kyon referred to the club saying ""With a level of disinterest bordering on apathy"" since that's exactly how I felt throughout the series.

First of all, I have to mention that the original story is great. This anime adaptation however is an abomination and clear cash grab trying to profit from a dedicated fan base. I'm going to keep this review short because I can not be bothered. 
Just search ""Overlord goblin army cgi"" on YouTube and you can deduce my opinion. The show is filled with stuff like this. For a bit more of a rant and a more grounded opinion, read below: 
Story: This adaptation suffers from major pacing issues. While the original story is great, the anime can not do it justice. While we are shown the dark side of Ains' campaign to conquer the world, we also have to sit through several episodes of failed character building for the people of Carne Village. It's slow, it's boring but there was potential for these characters. Madhouse just squandered that potential. 
Art: What art? The story is plagued with bad CGI, to the point that is seems to want to compete with Berserk for worst CGI of the last decade. It might even win that competition as even Berserk knew that some stylisation was required, but here an army consisting of a single copy-pasted soldiers just bounces of a shield wall, like cartoon characters. The thing is, this is no cartoon. Like I said previously, just search  ""Overlord goblin army cgi"" on YouTube 
Characters: awful story pacing and truly bad CGI squanders the potential of the characters. 
Sound: not bad, not great. As usual, both the OP and ED are good, though seasons - and - were better. 
Enjoyment  and overall score: I could not enjoy this show due to the disrespect of studio Madhouse in regards to this show and its fanbase. The only reason I watched this show to completion is because the underlying potential is great. But I now regret waiting for it and not reading the LN instead

Hey everybody I try to write my first review on this page, so I chose Death Parade. I finished this one in - days and I was overwhelmed. A friend of mine gave me the hint to watch this anime, he only told me something about a bartender who let persons play a game of life and death and that was all. I liked the basic idea and so I gave it a try. What I find very fascinating in this anime is the development of the characters and for spoiler reasons I won't go into details. But what I can tell is that it's one of the best emotional animes I have ever watched. There are only a few anime and movies which made me cry and I count Death Parade also to it.  
Do you need to watch Death Parade? Yes, if you want to see great characters, which can not be any more different to another, a good and solide story, good animations/graphic then you will make the right choice.  
I hope this was not as bad as I think it is xD please forgive me for any grammar or writting mistakes, english is my foreign language.

Tension and Tedious are - completely different things! 
and it's clear Kaiji season - feels there is no distinction between the two. 
Unlike season - this addition just drags...and drags...and drags! on and on and on. 
Everything Else in the show is perfectly fine. the score is intense, the animation is crips clean, the voice acting is solid. but the single deathblow season - has is it's TERRIBLE dragged out pacing. it's not that noticeable in the first half of the season but it really begins to show during the second half. 
And this is where the Tension vs Tedious bit comes into play. The big final gamble of the series which starts around halfway the season and goes on all the way to the end. and every episode from this point on consists of only - things. --% of the episode is dedicated to the next ""cheat"" our pro-/antagonist uses to counter the other. and the other --% is showing their emotional reaction to either achieving or getting denied their goal.  
You can do this for...-...maybe - episode since were talking ""final boss"" in this case. but anything beyond that just makes most of the episode feel like padding. and geez -- episodes of padding was a frustrating sit. it's not a good thing when I'm yelling ""GET ON WITH IT"" at my screen. accompanied by skipping trough large portions of the latter episodes without missing ANYTHING important. 
I'll go as far as saying this season could easily have been -- episodes long it was re-cut correctly, while still have enough room to build tension without feeling rushed

*Disclaimer* 
Just personal scratch. 
Advised, possible spoilers. 
Opinion & Informal 
Art: -/-- It was good and felt like it had its own style. Anatomy and proportions checked out. The weird faces were pretty funny and they added a lot to the atmosphere as well as to the comedy. It didn't seem like they were relied on too much which is also a plus. The art was clean and was detailed at times. Nothing to complain about but I didn't feel like there was anything to praise either. The art was just good in general but wasn't impressive for the most part.  
Animation: -/-- Clean. No shortcuts that seemed out of place and everything seemed quite well done. The special effects and impact scenes were nice to look at. It wasn't over the top. The fast animation wasn't too much above average. Most of the movements were simple and didn't have much complexity so everything was pretty mellow.  
Characters: -/-- The characters were well done. They were the highlight of this show. The trio of girls in the Past-timers Club really made the comedy work. No one individual of the trio was overbearing and didn't steal the show. The dynamics between the characters and the amount of impact they individually made was balanced and felt natural. The character development was interesting too. The backstories and relations were quirky and each of the characters had their own flavor. In other words, not one character felt too bland and they each had enough life to them to make the comedy work.  
Plot: -/-- About average in terms of setup and premise. It's just a cute girls doing cute things show. The spice was the comedy and that spice is what sets this apart from other similar shows. I could see myself recommending this show if I were asked for a comedy recommendation.  
Development: -/-- Like the plot, there wasn't anything really outstanding about the development. It was a comedy done by cute girls. There wasn't some crazy world-changing development or anything like that. It was just -- episodes of comedy. I liked it. 
Music: -/-- The OP and ED were clever but not new. I liked the contrasting image both OP and ED create for this show to someone who may have no clue what this show's about. The bgm was fitting enough but wasn't too memorable. There wasn't any real sound design. 
Conclusion: -/-- Felt a bit weak and abrupt. It decided to conclude the show just as is, as-is the specific skit end. There wasn't a whole conclusion sequence. The conclusion was just like an abrupt end to a YouTube video. Somewhat fitting, somewhat weak. I don't have much to praise or complain about. 
Overall: -/-- This was good. I liked this enough to have this come to mind when recommending a comedy to someone so that's a win.

Haibane Renmai Review 
Small village, encased by huge walls... oh and with angels... Biblical reference much? 
The Haibane are people who are born from a cocoon and grow wings. This is all set inside a rather large village surrounded by a great wall. Only the birds can leave the city, everyone else including the Haibane must spend there lives within the village. The village is full of normal people and the Haibane live away from the city and commute to the village. 
The actual story of Haibane Renmai follows the life of a new born Haibane. When inside there cocoon the New born have a dream, they are then named after their dream. The main character of this Anime is called Rakka as in her dream she was falling, and.. as we all know, Rakka means falling in Japanese... right? None the less the story starts with Rakka being introduced to her fellow Haibane, the rules of the village and its customs. 
Rakka is a timid little creature, unsure and almost helpless. You cant help but want her to find her place in this new world, and wonder how she came to be there in the -st place. The supporting cast around Rakka don't make much of an impact apart from Reki, who is basically Rakka's guardian. Both are interesting and memorable characters. The other Haibane however were not so much, but the Anime is only -- episodes long. I would have liked to seen more character development, and learned more about the other Haibane. But reviewers cant be choosers. 
I found Haibane very relaxing and easy to watch. I haven't watched an Anime like Haibane in a good while. No action, no love. It was just a very enjoyable and touching story about redemption and breaking free of past sins and mistakes. And I'm aware that sentence makes it sound very overbearing. However I can promise you its not, you can watch Haibane without really looking at the symbolism behind it and just enjoy. But I've watched Evangelion... symbolism slaps me in the face after that damn thing. 
The animation is nothing spectacular, same as any Anime that has been released within the past - or - years. Which means its nice, just noting spectacular. That's not a bad thing, just no extra points on this front. The music is fitting for the story and is used very well. The opening and closing themes are not what I usually like in an Anime however it suited Haibane perfectly, 
Haibane Is a lovely tale of a girls journey to find her place and free her self of the feeling of guilt she has following her. Its a tale that most can relate to, because I'm sure everyone has something they regret and feel guilty about... even if its not as dramatic and ominous as the ones in Haibane. Anyone who appreciates the different genres of Anime out there should defiantly make some time to watch Haibane, Its a tale that will be imprinted on your memoires, and your top Anime.

A perfect example of an attempt at horror gone wrong. Ousama Game: The Animation is in short, a train wreck and easily the worst anime to premiere this season.  
In all -- of its episodes, there is very little to be said about what the show accomplishes. If anything, the more you watch, the more you will hate every passing moment.  
The anime starts out somewhat promising and quite typical with regards to most horror anime. There is a lot of disbelief and confusion at the beginning, typical of anyone that receives random text messages from an unknown sender. This quickly turns into madness and chaos ensues as people begin to die suddenly.  
The anime does a bad job of making an interesting, cohesive story that can capture your attention for -- episodes. The anime relies heavily on flashbacks, and we only ever get them from the main Nobuaki Kanazawa, who happened to survive the last game that he played. This the only character they give so much attention to during the run of the show and yet in attempts to frame him as the potential hero, albeit heavily damaged, and yet while he may have redeeming qualities, these flashbacks just take up space rather than helping propel the current story forward. There is a lot more that could have been done with the present story and depth that could have been built that was lost in trying to ground the story in events that have already come to pass.  
My other gripe with the story is that it just feels weak in general. There is an attempt to put an end to it, as the characters try to find the origins of the game and “solve the puzzle” so they no longer have to play, but like the show, their efforts are pointless in that there is no bigger picture to solve. We never get an understanding of where the game really comes from, who is running this game, or if there is a way of winning that is truly satisfying. Whether the point was to illustrate a winning game of a game you are meant to lose is not the issue, the issue arises from the fact that neither matters and it seeks to show us pointless and ridiculous deaths while the characters act just as ridiculously.  
The worst part of the show is without a doubt all of the characters we are presented with. This has to be the shallowest, most naive, unconvincing characters I have seen in a while. They see the events unrolling around them and yet are still unwilling to accept that this “game” they are a part of is real. They run around like chickens without heads and their motivations and actions are all meaningless and nonsensical beyond the simple desire to survive. We get around -- or so characters throughout the -- episodes, many of which die, but many also who the show focuses on and yet is unable to develop them beyond the worst typical traits present in a high school drama or horror film.  
Ousama Game The Animation was underwhelming all around. From the undercooked characters to the nonsensical deaths that fell upon them. This anime just felt like it was thrown together with little care for detail or desire to be enjoyed for any of its -- episodes. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone and am surprised I watched for all -- episodes. I was hoping it would somehow flip the script and become enjoyable, but week after week Ousama Game simply dug its grave deeper and deeper.

This was one of very few shows that I actually think would have been executed better as a movie. I just didn't feel like it needed to be stretched out across -- episodes.  
Where to start... Well, I like to begin with what a show did well, and unfortunately there's not much to say here. I thought the plot was interesting enough. Pretty typical for a human-experimentation centered sci-fi, but interesting nonetheless. When it comes to the story and any attempted plot twists, it wasn't that Cystal Blaze was boring, just very predictable.  
Okay, let's just say it. This show's biggest flaws: the characters were awful. Manami has got to be one of the most selfish, annoying anime characters I've ever seen. And what's worse, just as she seemed to be starting to redeem herself, they drastically cut her screen time. As a duo, I found Manami and Ayaka to be irritating. It seemed to be their job, pretty exclusively, to get into trouble and then need to be rescued for the sake of furthering the plot. I hate characters who exist to be useless.  
Akira was practically running his brother's detective agency, yet he never seems to do anything of consequence to the story. Shu's plotline with his on-again, off-again (because he's a cheating asshole) girlfriend was the only character storyline that I felt was done well... but again, I found it very predictable.  
Any show with just plain unlikable characters is going to be hard to get into. But I feel like they all had at least a little potential, based on their setting. I really liked the concept of Rags Town being a place where people go to escape their pasts with no questions asked. But even if they weren't being questioned on their past deeds (which are all presumably dark), this set up a great opportunity for character development. What brought each member of the detective agency to this town? Well, if you were expecting an answer to this... even for just one of the many characters, you'll be sorely disappointed.

I watched this anime at a point where I was starting to become a bit more cynical about anime. I had this nagging feeling haunting me that I had watched most of the good anime, the ones that I would enjoy, and even if I did watch better anime later, I would become too jaded to properly enjoy them.  
Now, I'm definitely going to sound pompous here, but I've always thought that I had a pretty good taste in anime, but at the same time, never so elitist that I fail to just enjoy an anime without trying to criticize it to death. Well I was starting to become a bit more elitist, and then this anime came along. It really resonated with me. 
You see, one of my friends had just committed suicide. Suicide. Effing SUICIDE. You always hear the stories of people whose lives were taken by their own hands, and you think, that's so sad but oh well its just some stranger in the end. And then it happens to someone you know. Someone you PERSONALLY KNEW. Someone you had talked to often, though eventually you drifted apart. 
Then, as if by some divine intervention, the day after I got the news, I watched the episode where they almost committed suicide(the first time). I won't lie, it hit me. I bawled like a baby. I even felt guilty for crying, because I thought, I never really reached out to this guy, I never really tried to understand him, so I don't have the right to cry. He'd probably even laugh at me up in heaven if he saw me. 
And precisely THAT is why I rated this anime so highly. Maybe it was just my own personal experience, but if that's the case, you can just treat this review as a extremely subjective opinion. This anime is amazing because it made me feel emotion that I hadn't felt in the last hundred anime I watched. It's amazing because it gave meaning to a life I didn't pay enough attention to.

Dedicating yourself to a passion is difficult, especially if that passion is an art form. Without the proper support system, your passion could taper off into an unfulfilled childhood dream. Yet, just as difficult is being the person with no path, whether it's because you have too many interests or too few.  
The main character of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Sorata Kanda, faces the latter issue, while his friends face the former. One thing this anime has done masterfully is portray the anxiety and turmoil of someone who is trying to figure out what they want to do with their life. Sorata has a lot of angst about this, especially because he is surrounded by people who know exactly what they want to do and are running for it at full force. The envy and even anger that he harbors toward is friends for this reason is a very realistic touch, and it's rather poignant as well, especially for people like myself who have dealt with the same feelings. These themes of finding a path and fearing the future are the emotional core of Sakurasou, which separates it from contemporaries like Toradora! where romance is at the center. 
That doesn't mean the other characters don't have their issues as well. Each one embodies the common struggles of artists: Aoyama overworks herself in order to support her dreams, Shina feels pressures to apply her talents in a way that will earn success rather than fulfillment, Jin deals with the guilt of someone choosing their goals over their relationships, Misaki plunges into her art with nearly obsessive focus, and Ryuunosuke isolates himself from the outside world. Each one has clear goals and trials, and the link between their mental health and their work (in both healthy and unhealthy ways) is a high point of the show.  
The relationships between the characters are equally rich in such hard-hitting observations, mostly about friendship. They have arguments over things that make sense yet they stick together nonetheless. They were brought together through their hardships and insecurities, a bunch of misfits forced together by coincidence who happen to create some of the strongest friendships they will likely ever have. They acknowledge the fact that they will probably drift apart later, yet those relationships do no lose their importance. This is another painfully poignant theme in Sakurasou that encapsulates the nature of high school relationships in a more grounded way than I would have expected. I specifically enjoyed watching Ryuunosuke and Rita's relationship growth through out the series, for whatever reason. 
Despite the rest of the series being rather down-to-earth (albeit with a fair dose of melodrama, though it isn't bothersome in this context), it is not free from common anime trappings. Nearly every joke in this show is the same: Sorata is taking care of Shina, they wind up in a situation that seems sexual, it is misinterpreted by either Sorata or an outsider, and somebody freaks out about it. Like every joke, it's funny for maybe the first three times, but it gets old real quick, and if you've seen more than one anime, you've probably already tired of this joke by now. Some characters have the potential to be annoying, with gratingly high voices that I personally can't stand (Misaki and Sorata's little sister are the main offenders). Luckily, these can be easily overlooked. 
The heartwarming ending certainly helps keep Sakurasou enjoyable, even if it is inconclusive as far as the main love triangle goes. It leaves a pleasant, bittersweet taste behind, which sums up the entirety of the show quite nicely. The beautiful animation and light colors heighten the youthful atmosphere and look nice overall.   
I would recommend this show to anyone who can identify with these themes, or anyone who enjoys bittersweet rom-com-dramas, as this is a solid one.

There are plenty of series where I've been unimpressed by the first few episodes, but grown to enjoy or totally love the result. It can be all about the writers hitting their stride, learning the characters, finding the new twists on old ideas that will surprise you, and somewhere in the middle there'll be a beach trip. 
This is not one of those series. This is the complete opposite. 
The writers actually started with a decent enough twist on the ""magic high school"" trope, and the first few episodes are ""good enough"" to make you want to see where it goes. 
IT GOES NOWHERE! Instead, the writing spirals downward after about the third episode. The characters are completely two-dimensional (no pun intended). They're stupid to the point of absurdity, and it's only their stupidity moving the plot forward. That's the kind of cheap writing that you can get away with a few times in a series, but you can't build the entire thing on it. This isn't Hamtaro, for crying out loud, it's trying to be a ""serious anime."" I lost all suspension of disbelief somewhere around the time where we find out why the main character was adopted (something like episode -). It was crap before that, and it's unwatchable after. Oh, and there's the antagonist who doesn't care about killing her allies until she accidentally injures one. I pretty much fast-forwarded the last three episodes just to find out the ending, which was predictably stupid. 
I really don't like spoilers, so I'm trying to be vague about the plot points and describe the series in terms that will help you recognize what you're getting into. All-in-all, this series was barely worth having on as filler while you're doing something else.

After more than --- anime series under my belt, you become a bit sensitive to tropes and desperate for something original. This series has a few really creative elements and is very engaging with only three exceptions: 
-) Some of the characters are solid tropes... not too terrible, but annoying. 
-) The mechas have eyes and mouths. It's a terrible design choice and the trend needs to stop. It breaks immersion and looks stupid and childish. 
-) There's nothing that tanks a show faster than completely unnecessary and in-your-face fanservice. The idea that it takes both male and female to pilot a mech could have worked, but forcing her to bend over in doggy position, using her as a control stick, and all the talk about them entering them when activating (complete with sexual moaning) is just too much. 
In the end, I'm enjoying the show, but I'm watching it alone because it's practically an ecchi show. Apparently the mangaka or anime studio didn't think the story wasn't good enough to sell itself. Too bad.

-Expect the unexpected 
Surely we have a lot of anime series that gave us excitement on twisting what already is twisted from their stories and I'd say Tiger and Bunny is a one great example of it all. 
Characters -/-- 
Well, I love the characters and though there will always be those common(or usual) traits you'd find similar in other anime series, characters in Tiger and Bunny will surely leave a mark on you specially the two main characters Kotetsu and Barnaby. They may have the cat and dog relationship but they executed their conflicting attitudes in a lighter way that the audience won't find annoying or tiring to see over and over again. The other heroes as well have different behaviors towards each other but when united goes with a nice mix of teasing and fun. 
The characters themselves establishes the idea that anyone can be a hero as long as they have the passion to do so and speaking of passion there is also Agnes and his cameraman who will always be passionate on their job of getting higher ratings and is always on the go with adding spice to the anime. 
Art -/-- 
The art is really great, I love how the characters were drawn and it was actually their appearance that made me watch the anime at first thinking, I like the art and how it's mixed with lil -d effects specially the colors incorporated with the heroes. I totally love Kotetsu and Barnaby's art with AND without their cool suits. 
Music -/-- 
All the music used(specially ot & et)goes well with the whole series though they are not the kind of OST you'd love putting on your ipod to play again and again, nevertheless, It wasn't so great but not a let down either. 
Overall -/-- 
I'm not into action genre because I'm an adventure and horror freak watcher and I honestly thought that Tiger and Bunny is a mecha-anime series but thank god I know how to read reviews, synopsis and information that I decided to give it a try. If you're looking for an anime worth the watch and knows how to tickle you here and there while filling you up with tons of action scenes then this series have all the qualities not to be missed out. 
Watching the anime didn't disappoint me one bit and I'm totally satisfied to have seen such a great series after a long time. ^__^

I will always fight against the classification of Eva as a mecha anime.  This series focuses far more on the Childrens' emotional development and dissection of their identities.  Even when they're fighting, it's never just about victory.  Battles always have a deeper meaning- berserker, emotional strength and persistence, pride, and the psychological breaking point, for example.  I have even recommended Evangelion to my college psychology and sociology professors. 
Normally, I do not enjoy stories that survive on withheld information (ie anything by Dan Brown).  Evangelion does it right; obviously we don't know the history, the biology, the politics... or anything at all when it starts, the suspense comes from the plight of the characters and their struggles. 
Symbolism abounds, *especially* if you have the directors cut versions of -----.  If I ever hit the bottom of all the levels of meaning, I'll try to send word to the surface.

The synopsis doesn't do this series justice. You heard me, a lot of us decide on whether to watch a show or not based on the synopsis, so I thought I'd just give a heads up.  
In describing this series with a single word, I'm going with ""refreshing"". The series is another one of those pseudo-romance shows where it does have bits and pieces of romance here and there but it isn't really the center of it all, well as far as it's -- episodes spanned that is. This show is more about realistic drama and ""actual"" funny comedy. Realistic you ask? It's realistic because it's relatable and it's not over-the-top melodramatic shit.  By actual, I mean no boob humor and cliches. 
The characters are awesome and they feel connectable and humane. They aren't stale like all the other standard MCs. Another bonus is that it isn't really just about the MC and his girl, the cast really feel like a cast where-in they all play a part and add in something to the story. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of side characters created for the sole purpose of fan service and comic relief by now, so have no fear because the ensemble that makes up this one is far from that. 
The art and animation are awesome. Very modern, crisp, vividly colorful and fluid. Not much to say about that. As far as enjoyment goes, I was hooked from the very first episode and finished the whole series within a day. I'm sure you all know what that means. *wink* I rated this a - because honestly, my only complaint with this show is the fact that I wanted to delve in deeper into the ""romance"" part of Mashiro and Kanda's relationship. :-

I came here looking for hot anime girls kissing, and while it DID deliver on what I wanted, it didn't do it particularly well. If you're looking for a well-choreographed action shoujai ai with a compelling story, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is softcore lesbian porn for jacking off to when when hentai haven is down or something. Even then good luck finding uncensored versions. Actually, I think my enjoyment may have been raised by the ethereal glowing nipples all over the place, it was certainly good for a few laughs. 
To be fair, the character designs are pretty interesting, even considering they're --% boob. 
There's some stuff in there that's VERY obviously fetish fuel, more so than all the uh...lowkey sexual assault. But who knows? Maybe you're into that. 
The animation gets worse as the show goes on, but Hatsune Miku's weird cousin shows up in episode - so there's that to look forward to I guess. 
If nothing else, the opening theme is an absolute banger and quite possibly the best thing about the series. 
-.-/--, turn your brain off, have a few tissues ready just in case. Enjoy. 
Update: Finished the series, there's some nicely animated fight scenes in the finale, but nothing too noteworthy

Amazing art, and a fun watch but beyond that it fails to hold ground. Characters can be fun to watch but are pretty one-note and get little to no development; like, I think Pops is the only one who actually gets any development or something resembling a character arc.  
Story has much going on while not doing much at the same time, little is explained and it feels like you're missing major backstory to a lot of things. This does open up room for theories but if your entire movie centers around needing theories or an outside source of information without any evidence within the movie able to prove or disprove anything, you're doing something wrong. It outright feels chaotic with how much is going on, the Redline race has practically an entire war going on at the same time as the race itself and it's incredibly hard to even know what you're supposed to be following since it jumps all over the place constantly.  
JP is an interesting protagonist, doing his best to act cool which other characters call him out on or flat out ruin his moment of trying to be cool, it's a nice change of pace - however, there's practically no character to him beyond that, same with pretty much every other character; they have one unique trait that the others don't have and that's it.  
-/--, enjoyable and features some of the best art I've ever seen, but ultimately nothing special beyond that.

Holy crap, it's finally over! The anime of my dreadful loathing! This anime was just so bad, I HAD to write a review on it.  
Kanokon was obviously made with horny sex craving  boys as its audience. You want fanservice? It has fanservice. You want naked chicks? This anime has it. In fact, this anime goes over-the-top borderline with its sexual innuendos, activities and visual eye candy. The main character, Kouta, is stalked by two girls, both being what men usually crave. The ready-and-willing big-breasted pretty girl, and the ready-and-willing breast-less loli character. Both want sex from him, and will do anything to do it. To sum it up, this anime is probably the closest you'll get to a hentai without it actually being a hentai. 
Story 
The story was mediocre, at best. I loved the whole 'demons and spirits mingle with the humans', thing, but that's about where it ended. The arc with the little loli-girl and her Nue partner was the closest this series got to an actual plot, and was probably the  only part of the series I really enjoyed, since it mildly turned away from the ecchi to focus on action and combat. The fact that two girls follow and want to bed one boy who looks like he should be in grade-school was enough to turn me off. I'm a girl, and I love my shota, but this is just unbelievably unrealistic to a very fine degree.  
Art 
This is where the anime really shines. The art is undeniably some of the best in the anime released this spring, and I probably won't forget the beauty of Kanokon's style anytime soon. To be honest, it was probably the art that made me stick with and endure the show to the last episode. Even I have to admit that the animation remained smooth throughout the entire series. Maybe when animating the males it fell slightly, but when doesn't that happen when you're watching an ecchi or harem anime? The Art would have gotten a perfect -- if it wasn't for my lingering thoughts that the animation was made like this solely to tune up the ecchi. 
Sound 
Not really much to say here. The only really great point of the sound is the voice-acting. Of course, to most that's the whole deal right? I don't really remember the music that much, so that goes to show that it wasn't all too good in my opinion. Yeah.... this is all I can really say about the sound. 
Character 
The characters were decent enough. I didn't really like the fact that poor little Kouta's called 'the ero-king' by all the girls and is put down by that, even though it wasn't his fault. Of course, that seems to be the fate of all boys in harem and ecchi animes. Even if a face-plant into the nearest rack was an accident, it's ALWAYS the boy's fault. Poor, poor boys. There were only three characters that succeeded in putting a smile on my face whenever they were onscreen. And that's Tayura, and the twins Ai and Ren.  
Enjoyment 
Is it over yeeeet? 
This anime had me checking my player's episode length to see how much longer I had to suffer through another episode of boobs, sex and girls that want sex. I was so bored through most of the episodes I would pause about every eight minutes to go see what was happening elsewhere on the net. Yes. It was THAT good. 
Overall 
Overall? Don't watch it unless you're a boy that gets off on this kind of stuff. Or a  girl that can tolerate this anime that greatly degrades women.

This can be seen a light analysis on: Psycho-Pass, its characters and its themes since I really wanna talk about it, but I don’t want to spend hours writing walls of incomprehensible text.  
Psycho-Pass presents a gripping premise accompanied by one of the greatest anime rivalries of all time. Psycho-Pass is a thought provoking tale that makes you genuinely think every single step of the way. Psycho-Pass s a story of revenge and fulfilling ones ambitions. Psycho-Pass is the story of a women and her struggles to stick to her ideals, even against formidable foes. Psycho-Pass is... certainly something alright.  
In the first - or so episodes of Psycho-Pass, it’s not really clear what It is or want it really wants to be. It presents a few well-done action oriented episodic episodes that help showcase how flawed the Sybil system is, and introduces the characters, their motivations and ideologies, but I couldn’t help but feel like it was directionless in a way. Where they going for the banal “Oh, they’ll destroy the evil Sybil system because it’s evil!! like many shows in the past have? 
Shogo Makishima changes everything. Shogo is a revolutionist whose ambitions mainly consist of taking down the Sybil system which he thinks has robbed him and society as a whole of individuality and the ability to feel “stress” and live life to its fullest. He thinks that being handed everything won’t let you experience the wonders of the world and actually feel like you achieved something yourself. He genuinely believes in his ideals, and believes that he is in the right; his low crime coefficient helps display that. He wants to bring change through anarchy. He wants to do it through ruthless schemes that involve the loss of life; he may more or less be seen as an anti hero at first, since he attempts to achieve seemingly righteous goals through wrongful means, but that depends on who you choose to interpret as right and wrong. Even if he does get his way, what then? Go back to our old ways? Would that even work? How would society react to that? Is it even worth sacrificing the more efficient and relaxing Sybil system? Yes, it sacrifices uniqueness, but is that of any value when compared to mostly stopping crime? Yes, the Sybil system is flawed in more ways than one, but isn’t it our job to help make it work instead of fighting fire with fire and causing more problems?  
On the other side of the coin, there’s Akane. Akane Tsuenemori is a newly appointed inspector of Unit -. She embraces the system; in her own words, it is not the job of law to protect people, people are the ones that protect the law. She wants to help better the system and cover its defects while still keeping order. She’s the foil Makishima’s destructive goals, as he is to her. Throughout the show, her resolve is challenged; her loyalty to her ideals are showcased when she even sacrifices her own friend to keep them in one of the most heart wrenching anime scenes of all time. 
Kougami Shinya is a wild card. He is hopelessly obsessed with crushing Makishima; the man who murdered his friend in his murderess, self-righteous path to true justice. He genuinely believes that he’s the only person who can and is willing to stop him and bring him to justice. Because no matter what happens, someone as cunning and vindictive as Makishima will always find a way out. He’s the only person who’s willing to sacrifice everything  to bring him to justice; no one else is. He once had similar beliefs to Akane, but Makishima changed that; he turned him into the man he is today. The man who wants to kill no matter what; even if he betrays the system in the process. 
The side characters in Psycho-Pass aren’t really given as much focus as I would’ve hoped, but there’s still some interesting stuff I want to touch on. Masaoka is a really intriguing case of how someone from the old guard; the people not as well-informed and more attached to traditional means would perceive the Sybil system. He rejects the idea, which is understandable since it costs him his distinctiveness and independence; just like society, he would also receive specific orders and be told what to do. It’s not he who’ll bring the criminals to justice anymore, but the system. Initially, Yayoi wasn’t really interesting in pledging allegiance to Sybil and selling herself short. She didn’t want to be a slave to the system, so to speak. But once she saw how her friend, and the side opposed to it acted and how they threw away their happiness and forgot everything they cared about  to fight it; she decided that combating them would far surpass destruction and chaos.  
Won’t really go into details on the production values, but let’s just say that they made every single scene umpteen times better.  
This review doesn’t even scratch the surface of what Psycho-Pass really is, which really shows how much it is able to with so little. The amount of topics and ideas this show covers is just fascinating.

Overview: 
Hot take! Kaiba is overrated as fuck! In all seriousness, Kaiba is actually a pretty good anime. The animation is stunning and the character designs are wonderfully unique. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the series from a writing standpoint and I don't believe it's one Yuasa's best works. Honestly, I liked Lu Over the Wall more than I liked Kaiba. I liked Kick-Heart more than I liked Kaiba. Cat Soup? Yep, it's still better than Kaiba.  
The story of Kaiba is told in an almost maddeningly confusing manner, but it's actually pretty simple. People are now able to store their memories in little flash drives and switch from body to body. People can also erase bad memories and download happy memories that belonged to other people. The wealthy use this technology to keep switching bodies and live forever, while the poor sell their bodies for money. The poor are told that they will be stored on a flash drive and their families will one day be able to get them a robot body, but typically their memories are just erased and they're killed off. The poor live on shitty planets and the wealthy live on super ritzy planets that are inaccessible to everyone else.  
All of these are supposed to be mind blowing, incredible plot points, but everything in Kaiba is a well recycled Science Fiction trope. The story is basically just a shitty Metropolis, but doesn't say anything new about the evils of wealth inequality or social stratification. Hell, it says far less than Metropolis did -- years ago! Evil rich guys switching bodies didn't start with Get Out. It was done in B-movies way back in the early --s like ""Frankenstein Must be Destroyed!"" How about the part with downloading happy memories and deleting bad ones? That was done in Total Recall. Also known as Ah-nold und zee sree boobs! Back around -- years ago there was a shitty action movie with Justin Timberlake called ""In Time"". In that movie, poor people have to sell years off their life to wealthy people, who accumulate time until they can live basically forever. It may have --% on Rotten Tomatoes, but it was just as deep and profound as anything I personally found in fucking Kaiba.  
Maybe the problem is with me. Other people watched Kaiba and got something meaningful out of it. That's awesome! More power to those people. I've heard frequently that it's all about the importance of memories and how we should cherish all our memories including the bad ones. I mean...yeah. My grandmother has dementia. Of course I cherish my memories and fear losing them. I don't personally consider that a profound lesson, but that's just me.  
I've also read this series is a love letter to Osamu Tezuka. Seriously?! Of course I can't speak for Yuasa. Maybe he really said that in an interview. Personally , I have my doubts. Mr. Yuasa loves animation as a concept, but has never displayed a real love for ""anime"" as non-Japanese know it. I don't think there's an otaku bone in that man's body. There's a quote falsely attributed to Alan Moore that says ""I don't make comics. Those are garbage for children. I make graphic novels"". While Moore never said anything like this, I could absolutely picture Yuasa saying ""anime is trash. I make artsy cartoons!"" I'm supposed to believe that anime's greatest outlier, who spent his entire career being as un-anime as humanly possible decided to make a Tezuka tribute? I'm calling bullshit. 
The character designs are pretty awesome...mostly. Then there's this flying booger named Hyo-Hyo that never ceases to be obnoxious. Navi from Zelda would make up excuses not to hang out with Hyo-Hyo. Then we have this weird black caricature with fat, blue lips and a bulging tumor on his forehead. Oh and his name is Vanilla. God damn it Yuasa. What the fuck were you thinking? 
We all love Yuasa. However, I feel the man is much more comfortable as an artist than as a writer. His best works are Ping Pong, Tatami, and Night is Short, which were all adaptations. When Yuasa does the writing, we end up with stuff like Cat Soup. I was disappointed by Kaiba, but I'm glad other people love it. Now go and spread that love by fixing the fan wikia! As of the time of this review, the wikia is barren and has had zero effort put into it, as if nobody actually gives a shit about this series. The Wikipedia page is also a near stub and lacks basic episode summaries! There are --,--- people just here on MAL who would say ""I LOVE Kaiba! I don't just include it in my favorites to look smart!"". One you guys please go fix this.

Ernest Hemmingway once said, ""Never think that war, no matter how necessary,nor how justified, is not a crime."" While many may dispute that axiom, others... many others can find truth in those words. However, many of us have an ideologized idea of war, that we must bomb Country X because they are Enemy B, or that war is bad because violence doesn't solve things. While they maybe true facts, they are nothing but hollow words, said by people who have never been in the battefield or lived in a war zone. We say these things in a safe environment, trying to be politically correct or moral. We say all this, and go to bed without wondering if we will survive the next day. We think we know war, but in reality, we don't. 
Grave of the Fireflies depicts a different outlook on war that is hard to find in modern media. Instead of the heroic war movies that glorify war and the reassuring defeat of the 'enemy', it portrays a more personal and direct perspective of war, from the smallest and weakest of the population: children. Meet Seita, age --, and his little sister Setsuko, age -, they have managed to survive the Kobe firebombings that occured close to the end of World War II. Unfortunately during the firebombings, they also managed to lose their mother. With their father away currently serving in the Navy, Seita and Setsuko seek their distant aunt who lives in the country. As rations begin to dwindle, so does their aunt's generosity and kindness. Rather than dealing with their aunt's abuse and resentful nature, Seita decides to move out of her house with Setsuko to an old abandoned bomb shelter. Thus begins their struggle for survival in a war torn country. In a sense, the children are fighting their own war, they have no distinct enemy. Instead, they have a multitude of enemies, such as malnutrition, hunger, depression, and poverty. They have no weapons, only each other to depend on. This is the true face of war. 
Grave of the Fireflies is not a light hearted movie and it isn't a childish and innocent depiction of war. With detailed animation and dramatic plot, this is one of the very few films that is worthy of the title of 'Masterpiece'. It is a movie that makes one think for hours, days, maybe even weeks, after one watches it, and comes to the conclusion, that yes, war is a crime.

So, I think this anime is very odd, there's no mistaking it, however I actually came up with a theory.  
I think this anime represents growing up. 
Sayuri is essentially one body, with Hiroshi, her mother, and her father connected to her. I think this represents how children depend on their family.  
When Sayuri's ""time to strike"" has come, the mother and father disconnect from Sayuri, this represents the child becoming independent in life.  
The striking part represents raising a child, as in Asia the ""tradition"" would be to beat your children (I am Asian before you say anything). 
Sayuri doesn't think much about beating her ""child"" as it is tradition, and the child doesn't fight back because it is tradition.  
And that just about concludes my theory.

Teamwork. Friendship. Motivation. An undying strength. The spirit to take flight. 
Such things characterize the great sports anime named Haikyuu!!. I haven’t seen many sports anime, but even so, I can’t imagine that more than a few rival this one in terms of… well, everything. 
I watch anime for many different reasons. Obviously the first is entertainment, or should I clarify, an ineffable empowerment you receive in your soul while watching anything anime. As per Anime’s First Law (see my profile), every anime is entertaining to some degree. But very few anime touch your heartstrings and play a soothing melody. I name those gems such as Mahoutsukai no Yome, Clannad, and One Piece. These shows genuinely make you feel warm and good inside. They make you believe, or want to believe all the more, in the meaning of humanity. The good that we can do, for ourselves and for each other. The pure contact of the human soul. That underneath the black and corrupt contamination rotting this world, something akin to a scintillating light yet sparkles. 
Upon initially starting Haikyuu!!, I wasn’t too intrigued. Maybe it was my lack of interest in volleyball. But once certain teams were encountered, once the blood really got pumping, it was one glorious ride. The further I progressed through the story, the more I grew to love the characters and their idiosyncrasies, the superb direction during games, the SOUNDTRACK by Yuuki Hayashi. Unlike your typical shounen, the journey for Karasuno isn’t one of continuous triumph. They lose. They shed tears. And still they trust in each other’s individual strengths because all they want, really, is to continue playing on that court. Winning is important, of course, but in comparison with the pure resonance of just being on the court, it just… isn’t as important. Rather, winning is the means by which the crows can continue to fly. 
Being a sports anime, most of the plot is dedicated to games. This should be obvious. The shounen battle here is defeating the other team (and eventually going to nationals), and interlaced throughout is the soulfelt desire to grow stronger, wipe away the tears, and continue to train and work together and ultimately seek that beautiful venue called the court. It doesn’t matter if you’re a king or a giant; for the team as a whole, all that doesn’t matter. 
I haven’t finished Kuroko no Basket or many other well-known sports anime so this may be naive of me to say this: but I don’t think many, if any, other sports anime can match Haikyuu’s use of camera angles, shots, and overall animation to depict the tension and exhilaration of sport. Compared to swordplay, yeah, sports doesn’t sound too exciting -- but after watching this pearl, I am now firmly more interested in volleyball and sports in general. Coupled with the music, which is divine and so good that it alone was enough to make me continue watching (but of course there was everything else), the battle is real. 
In terms of animation, Production I.G strikes again with its solid clarity. According to a poll given to Japanese people, Haikyuu!! was voted one of the best-animated anime. So watch it, especially if you’re a stud for good art. Anime is a visual medium, after all. 
If an anime remains in your mind, rather than being lodged away in your memory -- that is, if you think about a particular show every so often, if you’re reminded of it in daily life, if you entrust to heart certain lessons and messages -- then it is worth watching. It is a jewel. 
If an anime changes your outlook on life in some way -- if you now appreciate something more, or look at life with more clarity and/or joy, or what have you -- then it is worth watching. It is gold. 
Haikyuu!! did both of these for me. I now appreciate the deep cooperative feel of sport and the invigoration it brings even more than I have before. I now long for that interpersonal connection so intrinsic to sport. I now more firmly trust in the strength of bonds and the power of friendship. 
Which is, after all, one of the most recurring, and the most beautiful, themes in anime.

Sangatsu no Lion's first five minutes contain a scene I might characterise as one of the best in animation. A boy listlessly wakens, drinking out of necessity, dressing out of obligation, and leaving his sterile apartment out of confusion, an existence so fragile it could perish with the wind. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't tell people about his problems. He just moves on with his life.  
At first I did not understand why this scene had such an impact on me. I thought it could have been the beautiful music, or perhaps the captivating artwork so characteristic of Shaft. That wasn't it. What overwhelmed me was how illustrative it was of human life.  
People often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as ""brilliant"" or ""life-changing"". Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all. 
To say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one's quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft's greatest accomplishment.  
Sangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series' protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him. 
There is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people's happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing.  
This isn't meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei's problems, while significant and real, aren't much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei's journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.   
Rei's eventual breakdown is one of the story's most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told ""no, you are wrong"" does not do anything to help fix a person's issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He's just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers. 
The scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only -- seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei's growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still ""something"". Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei's evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change. 
Many aspects of Shaft's production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode's shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn't require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story. 
It's a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It's nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo.  
The music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time ""Sayonara Bystander"" began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn't a reaction I normally have towards music. 
One could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters' lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi. 
It's true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don't think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn't really in need of an ending. There's no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei's life and those of the people around him. His depression persists, and he remains an imperfect and flawed person, even if he now has friends and family by his side. He's still searching. He's still running. Perhaps that will change by the end of the second season or the manga. Maybe it won't. And that would be completely fine. I don't believe there is anyone, even on their deathbed, who has ever been complete as a person. We start imperfect, and we end imperfect, gradually, yet surely, evolving, unchanging. 
With most reviews, I feel compelled to discuss the anime in a mechanical way. ""The animation was nice"", ""the characters were developed well"", ""the plot was inconsistent"". It is because most anime feel crafted, like a specimen of sorts to be examined. How is this piece? How is that piece? Sangatsu no Lion never felt that way for me. It's bigger. It feels more real. And so I can't help but write something more personal, too.  
Is Sangatsu no Lion better than Honey & Clover? Maybe. Is it the best anime of the past decade? Perhaps. More than that? Could be. It is difficult right now to answer with complete certainty these questions I have been posing myself. Time is the best judgement, I feel. But I can say, without question or hesitation, that Sangatsu no Lion is the only anime since Touch that has had such a profound and visceral impact on me. And Touch was the best anime I had ever seen. 
Sangatsu no Lion is a statement that unhappiness is OK. Being depressed, unsatisfied or stressed does not make you weak - it makes you human. And so I find it appropriate to close with a quote from Hinata: 
""So what do you say at a time like this?"" 
""You say to do your best.""

Pupa the animation,a bad anime that had potential. 
When I first read the synopsis I thought the anime was intresting,but it was a mistake watching it. 
-The story is aimlessly rushed and leaves lots of gaps.(-- episode,each episode is - mins long) 
-The story leads nowhere and ignores events that could be intresting. 
-The scenes where Yume feeds on Utsutsu are weird and sometimes they seem like incest scenes. 
-The story jumps from one event to the next with almost no explanation and ends in the middle of nowhere. 
-The art is decent,not great but not bad either. 
-There is almost no music. 
-The character development is almost non-existent. 
Long story short,the story is stupidly rushed and goes to the next event without finishing the one that has already started,the feeding scenes are almost incest and the anime makes no sense. 
It pains me to see a promising anime getting ruthlessly butcherd.

I'll begin by stating my strongest gripe: the film feels disjointed due to the abrupt way it cuts the scenes and how little time is dedicated to deal with certain problems within the story. My guess is that they were trying to create this monotony that most people experience in their daily lives. It makes sense considering the movie is a sort of ""mundane"" approach on the issue of living under bombing raids and military pressure. Still, every time a work attempts to present a lighthearted atmosphere in the middle of such overall grim situation, I can't forgive but to think it's limiting itself by not adopting a solid stance. See, there's nothing wrong in trying to convey this contrast between innocence and cruelty, but trying to force that by moving from one moment to another without a time to breathe isn't quite rewarding. An example of that done right would be Hotaru no Haka, which regardless of how emotionally intrusive or morally ambiguous you consider it to be, is masterfully directed and avoids major discomfort regarding pacing by simply not suddenly changing the mood of everything just to convey the banality and mundanity of sordid events. 
Aesthetically speaking, my only gripe is how much the character design seems marshmallowed and unfit for whatever mood intended. At first, I found it to be overall pleasing and cute, but as soon I realized it was confusing me on whether I should be relaxed or tense, it began to bother me. Aside from that, it's overall gorgeous with a unique touch of visual realism that's always welcome in any war drama. The backgrounds are detailed and cozy, rich in colors and identity, vivid and with an endearing picture book-esque look. There are also several angles only properly done through aerial photography, which again denotes the commitment to realism where it's due. It's simply undeniable the amount of care put into it. The animation is fluid enough, though I believe it wasn't the focus as more often than not it's obvious they want you to pay attention to the scenery instead of how things move. However, once the bombings take place, the animation reaches its peak and realistically depicts war explosions battering the screen in a manner that I doubt has ever been so accurate in anime medium. 
I won't lie, the protagonist's voice doesn't fit, but it's still a great voice. It doesn't fit due to the cartoonish look that is like seeing a little girl talking like an adult. I appreciate how natural the voices sound; in contrast to the artificial screeches that exist within the medium, the voices are closer to what real people sound like. Odd as it may seem to have a new type of voice to be your main character, it is these little actions that diversify the search for new talents and different approaches in the industry, thus, commendable. 
Characterization-wise, it's obvious that the protagonist is the main focus. It's a coming of age depicting the development of a female character who faces several minor conflicts involving her family while dealing with the war and its outcome, and honestly, a lot is left to be desired. Most of the movie details a very generic situation: Suzu coming to acknowledge her own capabilities and trying to cease fire with her sister in law Keiko. The mundanity of events is way too clear, so much that it begins to beg for something more substantial to happen. Some major events like death and moments of extreme doubt are, unfortunately, rushed and not properly developed. It does not suffice to dedicate a mere few minutes to explore the regret, anger, and mourning involving an important and present character's death. In the end, Suzu doesn't really change beyond one would expect from the very beginning, as she doesn't draw a very innovative conclusion out of the whole picture the film provides to us. War is bad and we need to do our best. This is a rather common problem I perceive in most anime about war: they don't really do anything with the premise. It's interesting to explore different facets regarding a theme, but it's not actually leading anywhere. The mundanity of war isn't ambitious enough. Even then, its execution could have been superb if it wasn't rushed. This would give both the protagonist and the audience enough time to contemplate, feel, and think beyond the monotony she was trapped in but not necessarily brainwashed by. It'd be a lie to say that --% of the film isn't simply Slice of Life in War. In itself, it's not a bad concept, but it requires extremely careful directing to hold an air of poignancy. It's possible to delve further into other characters, but I don't believe they're worth analyzing when they mainly just set a conflict with the protagonist or contribute to the lighthearted vibe that weaves throughout the movie. It is indeed a character-driven movie, but by a character who isn't very deep or interesting past what's presented from the beginning. She does change, but just a little and we are mostly presented to how she reacts and interacts with others rather than how those reactions and interactions change her through time, which in my opinion should be the focus in any character study sort of story (as in Ashita no Joe for example). 
In the end, In this Corner of the World can be a very good movie depending on what you're expecting and planning to enjoy out of it. I can't stop thinking this is a ""feels good"" sort of anime and no matter what tragedy they tried to convey, it just didn't resonate with me at all. Maybe I had set the bar too high and got slightly disappointed, but my biggest gripes are without a doubt the pacing that's occasionally repulsive and the abrupt cuts that can annoy some viewers, myself included. I do believe the movie had a solid and genuine intent as an adaptation made with care and I do believe its execution, albeit flawed, manages to deliver enough to constitute itself as a worth watching piece of animation.

ef: A Tale of Memories. An anime that I had never heard of yet somehow made its way into my list. 
In my abruptly deceased quest to find a show that could move me, I stumbled upon this gem. It was a coincidence really, I can't remember clearly but there it was, in the MAL top user recommendations for a certain drama anime that I enjoyed.  
So I got curious, checked out the synopsis and art. Looked good. Checked some scores and they were even better. What could possibly go wrong? 
Well, everything did. 
Now with the uninteresting prologue finished, I'll move on to the actual review. 
We are introduced to a fairly small cast of characters, split into two different and simultaneous story arcs that never connect between each other despite having characters of the same family in both.  
The first arc, is about a love triangle between a manga artist, her newly found obsessed girl who is all over him, and a childhood friend. The second one is about a girl with a condition that prevents her from remembering anything at all for longer than -- hours, and how she meets a guy named Mr. Plainy Plainster. There are a few other support characters who have a story of their own I guess... none of them are worth mentioning. 
About the first arc, it's your overused love triangle. No, there are no special twists. The male main character is as plain as you can be, with his only defining trait being his talent for manga drawing. He lives in the house of a female childhood friend (who is sister of the girl with memory problems in the second arc) that is also in high school. He then meets an apparently popular and perfect-on-the-surface female, and chaos ensues.  
And if you thought there were few characters in the first arc, allow me to introduce you to the second one. Two characters total. The girl that can't remember things for longer than -- hours, and a male lead that makes Kirito from SAO look like an interesting man full of virtue. 
The story (or, stories) had some potential, but sadly always failed to be anything more than a laughable attempt to be deep or metaphorical. It would be less embarrassing if a mediocre show didn't try so hard to be something it's not. What I'm trying to say is, that this was made by SHAFT, so expect flamboyant and unnecessary animation. The artsy environments and overused symbolism are present everywhere, and they can be amazing additions to amazing shows, however they can also be a double edged sword if the content it tries to enhance simply fails to meet any expectation. This was the case with ef: a Tale of Memories. 
So little happens in the actual anime that trying to delve deeper into the story arcs would probably spoil the minimal plot points that ef has to offer, so I won't do that. Just know that this anime was based off an eroge, so needless and random sex themes are around just enough to break any possible immersion. Oh, I forgot that supernatural themes are also present for no damn reason too! 
To conclude, the only things that you'll find in ef are: the worst kind of melodrama, unnecessary fanservice and suggestive themes, pointless supernatural elements, hilarious attempts to make this disappointing anime seem deep (through different means), and a very diverse cast of boring, bland and whiny characters. 
Detailed analysis below: 
General:  
-Atmosphere -/-- --- This is a lackluster tale about teenager love. The repetitive 'cute' backgrounds and symbolism are simply out of place. 
-Characters  -/-- --- Completely unlikable cast of characters. I couldn't feel ANYTHING at all for any of them. 
-Story development & ending -/-- --- I laughed at the ending. And I don't have a heart of stone or anything, like I said at the beginning I started this because I wanted it to toy with my emotions, and the only thing it did was to toy with my laughter. Unexpected results. 
Technical: 
Art -/-- --- The actual animation is nice when it isn't trying to be -deep-me 
Soundtrack -/-- --- I actually didn't pay any attention to the sound. And the version I watched lacked any opening sequence so I won't comment on this aspect. 
Voice acting -/-- --- Whoever did Chihiro, aka the girl with defective memory, needs to quit voice acting. 
Personal: 
Priority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) -/-- --- To be honest I was expecting for something to happen... 
Memorability -/-- --- I'll never forget the worst show I blindly ventured myself into. 
Final score: 
-/-- --- Horrible 
I wouldn't recommend this piece of anime to anyone...  maybe to some enemies? It was the first and last time that I actually take MAL's user recommendations seriously.  
The themes in here can be quite inappropriate even though this show seems like an innocent tale about teen romance. Out of place scenes and dialogues that do not fit with some of the characters' traits are included just to be faithful to the source material, I suppose, which added to the overall hilarity. Not recommended for -- y/o or younger.  
There's also a second season or rather, a spin-off called ef: a Tale of Melodies. Based on the minor characters of this one. Needless to say I didn't bother to watch it, nor will I ever do it. 
This has been my second review, which was more in the verge of becoming a rant, but it had to be said. Don't watch this.

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I was disappointed to watch a decadent show, not the great Feminist Fantasy that Writing and Fighting for Love and Justice claims as is. Aside from how repetitive and formulaic the story is, I found myself actually feeling Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy alongside my mother by the end of the show because most of the characters were either unpleasant or miserable without subtlety. 
While I did like Juri and Wakaba, it didn't change the fact that I found none of the characters particularly relatable and that the show felt decadent much unlike the following works, all of which deal with The End of the World as We Know It, genocide, and/or the loss of loved ones. In fact, I found Count Bleck from Super Paper Mario, Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist, Anton Herzen from Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, and Sigma from Tweeny Witches far more sympathetic than the boring Damsel in Distress Anthy had always been. I only continued to watch until the very end because I wanted to see Akio, who had made me angry to death, face poetic justice. The Grand Finale left me unsatisfied because I didn't get to see him subjected to a Fate Worse than Death where he loses all of his wealth, gets his beauty tarnished, can no longer speak forever, is run over by his own Cool Car, and gets a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown by the Swords of Hate, the World's Strongest Woman, and the angry parents of his victims. 
While I love Feminist Fantasy works like Moribito, The Beast Player, Princess Knight, and Tweeny Witches, I don't think that the show lived up to its fame as one of these because it seemed to believe that Real Women Don't Wear Dresses. Anthy is the weak one in a dress in contrast to Utena, a knight in a modified boy's uniform. Whenever Utena becomes feminine, someone weakens her by manipulating her into conforming to gender norms. Enforcing gender norms is bad in itself, of course, but Princess Knight and Brave show that a girl can be both feminine and strong. But when Utena asks Anthy about femininity, Anthy replies, ""In the end, all girls are like the Rose Bride"" — an Extreme Doormat Stepford Smiler Damsel in Distress who stands around looking pretty and obeying her master. No other character I've ever seen was that pathetic, not even traditionally feminine ones like Queen Elinor from Brave and Atelia from Tweeny Witches.

My Hero Academia, the next generation of greats shōnens? 
After the end of mythical shōnens like Naruto or Bleach, the Jump publishes since ---- ""My Hero Academia"". If you feel its potential right from the start, I admit that I was still doubtful. 
A potential not yet exploited 
I started with the anime and I thought why not: the characters are endearing, the context is nice, the powers are more or less original. I watch the first season then the second and I detect a potential but not yet fully exploited. 
The tension is at its peak! 
And then the third season comes and what a surprise! I think I should film myself when I watch each episode: I startle, I shout, I cling to my chair, I applaud. I've been waiting a long time for this, that a rather long shōnen (about --- chapters for the moment) could give me so many emotions. 
Horikoshi Kouhei is very strong! He develops his characters bit by bit, creates a hostile context between the heroes and the ""villains"", he sets up this tension to finally exploit it completely from season -, episode after episode. 
Patience, patience 
Before reading the manga, I will wait the end of the third season. My only fear: to be so good at each chapter/episode, I'm afraid to get used to it and to be disappointed over time because let's be honest: many shōnens like Naruto or Bleach have shown flaws notably because of their length.

This anime will pull at your emotions with one moment you are laughing and then the next something serious happens, and then you are clinging to the edges of your seat waiting to watch the next episode.  
This anime will make you gnaw at your fingernails as you imagine what it would be like in the shoes of the main characters!  
It has amazing plots, and its characters are cute and the art is amazing. I love its opening songs, and it's unique in the sense that the main character is a lonely, friendless girl who is too considerate and kind, but very very shy. This anime not only centres around romance, but friendship love as well, and how important it is. It follows the steps to achieving amazing friends with amazing character developments, and how a loner, shy girl finds friends and eventually the guy she likes.  
I really loved this anime, and it's on my top list for romance anime along with Lovely Complex, and I really recommend you to watch it! You will be crying by the end of the series, and find yourself rooting for the characters every step of the way! It's not so deeply engrossed in romance of girlfriend and boyfriend that it becomes sort of annoying, but it deals with friendship problems, bullies, and even your friend's boyfriend/girlfriend messes.  
Watch it!

I'm dropping this, and I can't believe I stuck with it as long as I did. Overall there is NO story that I can tell. The story is mismatch together with no coherent knowledge of any of the subject matters it explores. 
We'll be a fantasy with elves, nope, then it becomes time travel, and that's it's main thing, although it has the MC jumping time lines, yet a ""hard reset"" happens after he gets an item when yeets himself out of that timeline, and leaving each timeline without him, it makes absolutely no sense when you consider how time travel works. 
It soon becomes a futuristic story and that's where I stopped. Again it makes no sense what so ever. 
Sound and Art or more or less the same, mediocre with plenty of reused backdrops and settings as if they rushed an already rushed story. Why it's getting -- episodes when it doesn't even deserve that is beyond me. 
Character: Well the MC is all about those women and protecting them and flirting with each and everyone of them, including the teachers. He doesn't even try to hid it. There are no note worthy characters in this anime as the plot for each is shallow and strung together but some ""logic"". 
I can't even say I enjoyed it, usually with time travel story, you have a mystery going for it, something the MC learns and goes though, well he does that, but the hard reset starts him from the beginning and he chose a different path without any concerns over the previous ones or even referring back to them. 
Overall, this is a waste of your time to watch, and a waste of the animators effort into a story that isn't even worth the time nor money it took to make. You can find better sub par stories than this that have a slight bit more of plot and enthusiasm to it's story else where.

When I watched the first episode of this show, I thought I was watching the potential best show of the season. Kaguya-sama’s over meta analytical outlook on high school relationships was quite refreshing.  It brought me back to the years when I thought about every little interaction in a paranoid hyperanalitical way.  Moreover, how the show personified the two main character’s narcissism in their fear of falling in love with one another was nothing short of brilliant.  On the contrary, the shows unwillingness to forgo this initial character trait that leads to its downfall.  In short, the show is just repetitive. 
As I stated above, how this show takes the micro scenarios that happen between two people unwilling to admit there love for each other—then proceed to turn the scenario into a Death Note style mind game—was brilliant, certainly good enough to have me watching through a few episodes.  I even found myself laughing along the way.  This charm only lasted for so long though.  As I was watching the earlier episodes in enjoyment, I had an underlying worry that the show would never develop past the two characters just fighting to try to get the other to confess.  And that the show would be just another waste of time romance where the two characters don’t get together—or get together at the very end of the show. To my misfortune, my prediction turned out to be true. 
A counterpoint to this I expect to hear is that the point of this show is the characters are supposed to never fall in love, because, as the show states, “Love is war.”  This is nothing more than a juvenile case of special pleading.  Since the show is so meta about the process of starting a relationship, it excuse it from reaching the logical conclusion?  I think not. If anything a show this meta should have the most grand confession scene just for the pure irony alone.  Regardless, the little micro scenarios in high school dating would probably be more interesting to meta analyze than them trying to get into one.  If This show was to have a second season of them dating, where the characters actually become more than just gags and actually characters, then I’ll happily mark my calendar and wait for it (PS I haven't read the manga).   
As it stands now, the characters are nothing but gags, adorable gags, but gags nonetheless.  We get inklings of their lives and struggles, which I do very much appreciate.  Like when they showed how Kaguya doesn’t like getting driven to school and would rather walk.  But they’re too little and too far between.  Why would the show waste time on developing a serious relationship between Kaguya and Miyuki when they could introduce Sasuke Uchiha to the cast and have him be afraid of Kaguya for some reason.  Not saying a larger cast is an inherent negative.  I actually like Sasuke.  It’s just that (like the US government) the show has plenty of resources, but it is going to wrong causes.  
With the episode count rising, the show’s initial charm fades farther and farther away.  On top of the fact that the gag is getting old, the scenarios that Kaguya and Miyuki go through get more and more inane.  For example, in episode nine, Kaguya gets sick from the rain (because anime) and Miyuki comes over her house to deliver her homework.  This is all fine and dandy until Kaguya’s maid, who is secretly a student at their school, makes Miyuki watch Kaguya while she’s sick.  Kaguya isn’t sick like a normal person; she instead is delirious from her fever, which translates to she’s drunk but the show doesn’t want to be real and have them get drunk.  Long story short, he ends up sleeping with her and she kicks him out in the morning in typical anime romcom fashion. Them subconsciously sleeping together isn’t a bad idea, but this episode nine setup is dreadfully.  It would be much nicer if, lets say, they went on a student council trip together—in episode two they even discussed such trip—and during the trip, they all get drunk together, then they wake up in bed together.  Wouldn’t that be sweet? Apparently I am the only one that thinks so. 
And with that, I don’t feel like writing anymore; I think I got my main point across: the show is cute but nothing else.  With that being said this jawn gets an it’s cute out of ten--which translates to a four out of ten.  I will do a live analysis of this show on Twitch at when it’s done airing (https://www.twitch.tv/infinite_fiend), so feel free to call me stupid in the chat--I’d love to hear from you <-.  Maybe if you’re feeling extra generous, help a brother out with a follow.  But that one’s up to you.  Have a nice night. Peace.

*****Spoiler free review******** 
Weesh, now that's tough.  
I've been a fairly big fan of Narita's work for a while now, yet i can't say i'm entirely subjective as i'd be with other anime.  
What mainly made me write this was the particularly aggravating nature of some people's claims when it came to durarara!! x-, some in this review board, others in places here and there. 
While Shou! to me was weak because it had very little to tell, and probably was one of the most filler-full (that's redudant) set of arcs so far, Ten! has decided to change the pace up a bit. 
You see, Durarara!! has never been a particularly well paced show. Hell, its pacing was so dreadful i still can't recommend it to most people. But that's part of its charm. As you waste your time away in seemingly unimportant storylines, consider some things given and go with the flow, it manages to make events warp around themselfs and twist in ways that only a show with the particular way of storytelling can. 
What i mean by that is, despite it being slow (hella slow), sometimes badly written (lets face it, some of the dialogue is great but some parts are downright poorly written), and sometimes outright confusing (the first season as well as some parts of this were not directly converted from the light novels, causing some confusion along the ranks of ex-brains base people, apparently) the way it presents itself is what manages to keep me interested. 
I'll first talk about the shallow stuff, art and sound, then move to story. 
Now, i've seen people say Durarara!! looks good, hey, it doesn't. Season one had some charm to it, but right now animation-wise it's not up-to-par. Maybe a bit above average, sure, but only due to the new designs and style they decided to go with, so they could be directly reffering the Light Novel's art. 
But what did surprise me is the music. Damn, that music. Every -- episodes have their own - hour soundtrack, and all of it is good. Jazz, some electro-inspired thrash-ish (something something, i don't know what i'm talking about), all give this air of mystery and intrigue. 
But what's actually happening in the show? Not wanting to spoil anything for this nor Shou!, Ten! decides that it's time to stomp on the old idea of Durarara, which was about -- episodes of build-up and - of payoff, and go with a more balanced approach. However that's both to its benefit and detriment. 
You see, the negative with the old durarara approach is that you have a lot of things to watch in -- episodes, yet all of them don't really seem important. You'll forget names, events, places, and eventually you'll get bored. Having very few things happen despite the premise of chaos ensuing is not compelling, and i get that. 
But when those - episodes come, the satisfaction is great. Every piece of the puzzle falls into place, characters evolve and understand, become more than what they used to be. That was the strenght of the past Durarara!! arcs, those few episodes. The rest was but build up. 
However with the huge number of characters introduced in Shou!, they all sturggle for screen time. THere are lots of things happening, and they're not dull as they progress the plot in some way. However they're so sparce and incosistent that you'll probably get lost in the chaos. Also the show in Ten! forgets to use its special tool, the many-perspectives storytelling, mainly because it can't, due to the the self-centric nature most of the characters.  
All of the cast has gotten darker as time went by, their own aspirations shreded and tossed away. Mikado is a prime example of this, as he's the one with the major change in this season. 
However we see very little. While he explains what he wants to do, and it's reasonable and noble, his actions get so very little exposure, plus their interaction with other members of the cast is so minimal, it's hard to care at some point onwards. 
Now, so far it looks as if i'm pointing out mainly negative things, and you're right i am. But i am so i can only emphasize what most people get wrong. 
You see, not being friendly with people who haven't watched the show in - years, i call it ""not wasting my time"". Being hard to sum up, i call it ""good overarching plot"". And while that may not always be the case, it has somewhere to lead to. 
A lack of ""main villain"" is always something i adored in the show. Izaya may be considered one, however his actions are within his own frame of mind and understanding, not just what most shows have. With the izaya development in Ten! i was hungry for more, but sadly the show didn't deliver. 
And that's the running theme with Ten!, sadly. It builds up so many things, it keeps the pace up so well, but it never delivers. It just stagantly watches as the characters get frustrated and confused, not doing anything to actually bring them closer and solve their missunderstandings. That is, untill the very last episode, which unlike what Durarara has done so far, instead of a payoff it's a cliffhanger.  
And now, why do i still care about it?  
Well, for many reasons. While characters can be called ""quirky"" instead of ""deep"", and i wouldn't consider it unfair, it manages to build up on those quirks just enough to make viewers understand they're actual humans in their own universe. They think and evolve along, moving forward with their ideals despite the actions of others. The cast is stronger than ever, with development done on many sides and perspectives. Everyone has their own worries, but while they can't know everything, they can try and percieve the nature of others. That's what causes missunderstandings.  
Not to mention, with Yodogiri Jinnai as well as Saika - on the table, we're seing a warfare on a different level. Izaya is no longer the only mastermind, so we can see some further development on that side.  
Now, in terms of enjoyment, i think that the best way to summarise Ten! would be episode -. 
You get the feeling of tension watching this season. As if finally they're under a real threat. But not only from others, but from themselfs, too. 
Relations are unstable, fragile. When you think that something is certain, Narita cleverly pushes your preconceptions out the window with the last few episodes.  
Who's right, who's wrong? That's all depending your point of view.  
All in all, i'm glad Durarara!! got attention again. Seing the charts of its light novel going up again this year to the point where this february it's up on the top -- of Japan, as well as the anime being in the top ten (no pun intended) of the season made me glad. That way we might get more anime adaptations, especially since the core series is done at this point.  
If you liked Durarara!!, you'll probably like this.  
It's not ""more durarara"". It's different, it's new. It decided to change and evolve along with its cast. 
If you didn't, you could still give it a shot. It's different enough that it might keep your interest. 
All in all, just a solid series overall. 
Lets hope Ketsu! doesn't dissapoint.

Golden Batman is a Korean animated movie from ---- based on a ---- anime series called Golden Bat or Ogon Bat in Japanese. Created by Takeo Nagamatsu in the ----s, Ogon Bat is a Japanese superhero that predates the likes of Superman, and Batman. Much to my surprise, Ogon Bat is considered to be the world’s first superhero. Borrowing more traits from Superman than the name of the ---- film would imply having super powers that include superhuman strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly. In the original Korean-Japanese production of the ----s anime series (according to what little information could be found on this series), Golden Bat is apparently the last surviving Atlantean who fights crime wearing a golden skull mask. If you see the poster, or promotional art you’ll notice that the golden skull mask is nowhere in sight. Turns out in ---- Golden Bat design was updated to resemble Batman.  
Now, the only viewable copy of Golden Batman is a Spanish dub of the film since the film never officially received an international release in the US. Probably because the new character designs rips off Batman. You either have to search to the ends of the world to find an old VHS tape, or search desperately online. If Golden Batman was dubbed in any other language besides English, or Spanish that would be the end of the story. There’s no English subtitles either so unless you know you're Korean, or Spanish well you're sadly out of luck. However, that is not the case for me so I’ll discuss the actual film. 
Golden Batman (or Black Star vs. Golden Bat according to the announcer in the beginning of the film) story follows a bunch of kids, and their talking pet dog trying to prove their bravery for their dying sick friend. There’s also a subplot revolving around villain Black Star who is kidnapping the world’s top scientists to develop a weapon that can make him take over the world. Pass the opening credit sequence which has cheesy music the first thing the villain, Black Star, is shown doing is watching a news broadcast. This news broadcast basically clarifies a scientist is working on “Rocket TM” which is described to be a robot for an Aerospace Science Central. Black Star after seeing the newscast decides to call the Aerospace Corporation, and announces to them in a phone call that he’s planning to steal the blueprints to “Rocket TM”. With this information you think the Aerospace Science Central would signal Golden Bat, or sing his Korean theme song to make sure Golden Bat appears at the scene in advance to stop Black Star. The Aerospace Science Central does not do that, and instead a army of clone security guards that were in charge of protecting “Rocket TM” fear at the sight of Black Star. 
This event make news waves where whoever translated the script into Spanish felt the news broadcast should say (paraphrasing) “We’re living in a time of authentic danger”. Leading me to speculate that regular crime committed by normal people in this world is not considered “authentic danger”. There’s also a pointless cutaway to a child crying where the mom threaten her kid she’ll call Black Star if he doesn’t stop crying. It contributes nothing to the story, but that some hilarious cruel parenting right there. It only takes around six minutes before Golden Bat actually makes first his appearance in the film for some further nonsense. Aside from his ridiculous character design the members of the mafia show their fear by doing some sort of invisible orgy from what I could interpret from the animation. You got one mafioso thrusting the air, and another mafioso thrusting the floor repeatedly. This leads into a badly animated action scene where Golden Bat wins easily. After stripping the mafia down to their underwear, and leaving one of them a red Bat on their chest Golden Bat leaves the scene. So why did Golden Bat go to the hideout of the mafia if it wasn’t to retrieve the blueprints is never explained. Well, Golden Bat is did strip down several mafioso down to their underwear so he had a plan of some sort that wasn’t aimed at kids (the film intended demographic). 
This goofy fight while entertaining sadly isn’t followed up on. Instead of following the last surviving Atlean fighting evil on Earth the film shifts focus to a bunch of annoying kids that really like Golden Bat for the majority of the film. Given the film is barely an hour, and ten minutes long the kids remain static characters. Along with the one dimensional kids, neither do Golden Bat, or the villain Black Star have much personality to them than stating the obvious between good, or evil. The movie also has a easy to follow story where you’re just meant to accept everything at face value. There’s a talking Cat, and a talking Dog that wears boxing glove in the film that everyone simply accept in their everyday normal life in this world. In one scene, there’s a kid who disguises himself as Golden Bat to scare off the mafia, yet the disguise changes his height, body structure, and voice simultaneously. I could buy the mafia falling for the disguise, and even Golden Bat flying out of a Lava pit unscrathed, but an entire costume changing a kid body structure is just pushing it.  
Among various nonsense of the writing there is Toltry (the main character) father who claims it is normal for his son to break his neighbor windows. I bring this up because the film does this frequently. It shows something to the viewer that is inconsequential to the story, and goes about it business like nothing happen. So for like -- minutes it does this until eventually the kids discover Black Star cave by accident. The film tries to setup drama by having a sick dying kid in the film, and revealing his tragic backstory through flashback. I laughed at this part in the film so that tells you how much I cared. Not only was the currently sick kid bald for some reason when his mother died, but became good friends with neighborhood kids on a whim. I would have taken the scene seriously if what sounded like bad porno music (the bad voice acting didn’t help either) wasn’t playing in the background during the flashback. Also, in the flashback a kid shed tears, and his tears goes through his glasses. That’s the kind of things you’ll notice when boring kids character are meant to carry an entire film. It’s difficult to care them too when they’re idiots. In one scene, Toltry tells his friend they should leave before they are discover by Black Star henchman. Instead of immediately leaving the evil layer the kids stand in the same place until an announcement finishes saying someone entered the evil headquarters. I know Toltry is the same character is who did animal impression to cheer up his dying friend in an earlier scene, but that was seriously stupid.  
The best part of the movie is easily whenever Golden Bat appears on screen because ridiculous things happen on screen. It’s a shame he’s delegated into the background since the climax is the highlight in the movie. During the climax, the film could care less about the tiny details like logic, and rational thinking as Golden Bat beats up everyone in his path. Golden Bat fights against an army of clone henchman, a robot, and eventually the villain with just whatever came up to the animators mind. Golden Bat is so powerful that he even survives falling into a pit of Lava, and flies out of it without a scratch to fight the villain of the film. The final confrontation is entertaining seeing Golden Bat fight a villain who can seemingly shoots laser out of anything he touches. If the movie offered more cheesy superheroes antics over annoying kids than the film would have been more enjoyable, though probably just as badly written. It would make the moment where Golden Bat karate chops off Black Star arm off look less out of place given the intended audience was obviously for kids. 
Animation is odd. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful in finding the studio behind this film. Then again I guess it’s for the best since the animators have a clear butt fetish in the film. Characters are slapped in the butt, kick in the butt, patted on the butt, and a couple of shots to show fat kid butt. Putting some detail into them which questions where the animators priority were at. Throughout the film there’s many examples of bad animation like a character face being colored differently from the rest of his body, a kid head going through a bed sheet even he’s a couple feet away from it, and Golden Bat flying off seemingly out of thin air from a window. My favorite pieces of bad animation is the constant jittering from all the characters in the film that never stops. It’s quite an accomplishment when the animation is so bad that still animation wasn’t done properly. However, the non stop jittering of characters make can scenes unintentionally funny when taken out of context. Usually making it seems like characters are doing something sexual like making it appear like a fat kid is giving his dog a rough time.  
The character designs are basically bland. Golden Bat character design is baffling. It looks like Batman, but the combination of blue, red, and yellow in this film strikes fear in the enemy's heart. His cape is blue on the outside, but red on the inside. He has a red Bat on the front which looks ugly the yellow suit, and blue everything else looking very ugly. Backgrounds are okay for the time it came out. Unfortunately without much action in the movie the animation doesn’t provide much to look at. 
I saw the film with a Spanish dub, and regardless of what language you actually understand you can obviously tell this is horrible voice acting. Now I can’t list any specific voice actors since the credits are written in Korean, and the Spanish dub didn’t list any Spanish voice actors in the closing credits either. The only voice actor I would give any compliment to is whoever voiced Golden Bat did a good job in his role. His role was rather limited in screen time, but the voice actor felt self-aware of the role he was playing, and chose to ham it up. It felt appropriate with the tone of the film. Golden Bat was also the only voice actor whose performance was remotely enjoyable because he was intentionally campy. Even though Golden Bat was the hero the evil laugh of Golden Bat as he beats up people is hard not to enjoy. Every other voice actors was terrible. The whole cast simply not caring about their performances. The only things that aren’t dubbed in Spanish are the Korean song tracks. Including two moments where the kids sing Golden Bat theme in their original Korean language, and oh man it’s awful! The kids are out of sync, can’t sing those high notes, and also can’t sing.  
Golden Batman is an interesting piece of animation history, as well the source material it's based on, but there’s nothing to see here. Golden Bat takes a back seat in his own movie even though he has top billing in the film title. While unintentionally funny in parts the annoying voice acting, and the amount of time it likes to waste on pointless diversion it’s better to leave this relic of the past unseen.

Nekomonogatari: Kuro is the third adapted installment of the Monogatari series, an array of light novels written by Nisio Isin. It serves as a precursor to Bakemonogatari and features Tsubasa Hanekawa during the events of Golden Week, in which she becomes possessed by a neko (translated as ""cat"") and indiscriminately attacks people on the street to relieve her built-up stress. Viewers of Bakemonogatari may recall references and flashbacks to this incident particularly in the Tsubasa Cat arc, and here we finally see it divulged in detail. 
Now coming from the markedly huge success of both Bakemonogatari and the controversial Nisemonogatari, fans may likely enter this third installment with a few qualms. After all, Nisemonogatari occasionally acted like a completely different series than its predecessor Bake, with the most divisive issue being its more prolific fanservice. And now viewers are left wondering whether Nekomonogatari will continue the footsteps of Nise or tread back towards the more ""conventional"" success from Bake (well, at least more conventional than Nise). The result? 
A mixed oddity. 
Structurally, Nekomonogatari is like a bizarre child born from a vile yet oddly alluring incest between Bake and Nisemonogatari. It takes the most successful aspects of both series and tries to mash them into its own masterful direction. But the end result is less a full-on masterpiece than an overall great but not perfect special: Neko thrives and yet occasionally suffers from the very compiled aspects it relies on. 
On a holistic level, the story follows Bakemonogatari's arc formula quite closely. It starts off—much like a visual novel or eroge—with several cameos of the ""see girl then talk to girl"" type. Here, it stays light-hearted in its comedy while tossing in some witty dialogue between our sexually frustrated Araragi and one of Nekomonogatari's several supporting characters. The overarching mystery is then introduced, some character development and macrabre-like drama ensues, a solution is finally realized, and the status quo is achieved again. 
While this formula is nothing new coming from the five alike arcs in Bakemonogatari, it is nonetheless executed in a well-woven and highly enjoyable manner. Really, this alikeness to Bakemonogatari is actually one of Neko's strengths, as it keeps the plot structure fresh and interesting coming from the slower and more casual pace of its predecessor Nisemonogatari. Even the sudden, fast-paced action scenes involving some form of an Araragi massacre continue to be outlandishly eye-gripping and exciting, not only in its sudden change of pace coming from the heavy dialogue, but also in its vivid detail and fluid animation. It is no exaggeration that these extremely gory scenes keep viewers on their toes and high on the suspense, even if these scenes are just part of the arc formula to reach the end conclusion. After all, being the subject of mutilation is Ararararagi-kun's modus operandi, a lose to win scenario, and he certainly doesn't disappoint in being the best loser there is (I'm bad at puns). 
Now aside from the story structure, what the Monogatari series truly shines in is its engaging, witty dialogue. Nekomonogatari is certainly no sloucher, as it touts some of the best soliloquys in the series and continues to make great use of its art direction in keeping the dialogue-heavy script truly captivating. Regarding the subject of much of the dialogue itself, Nekomonogatari acts more like Nise in employing a raunchier perversion and boning up the sexual tension to the largest tip. This isn't to say in contrast that Bakemonogatari is the Virgin Mary of anime, but the sexual undertones and fanservice in Bake is arguably done in a more playful and ""intellectual"" manner, though it still has its fair share of ecchi(-ish?) slapstick comedy and deadpan humor. 
This brings us to the most controversial topic in the series—fanservice. 
Whether you may be in the ""too much"" or ""too little"" category, there is no doubt that the Monogatari series lives by its unique art direction, strong characters, and witty, often sexually charged dialogue. All of these elements, including fanservice, are just as frequent in Neko as they were in Nise, and whether it's discussing porn and fondling breasts with your sister or licking desks and gaping at a scantily clad Hanekawa-nyan, Nekomonogatari does not hold back on its fanservice—for better or worse. 
However, there is a lot to be said about the source material here. This four-episode series stays pretty true to the light novel it adapts to, and does quite a good job at condensing the entire novel into only -- minutes. That said, the fanservice could have been a lot more prevalent given the elaborate detail and flamboyant panache of the novel (where's our --page rant on Tsukihi's pantsu??). Personally, I find the occasional subtle fanservice more enjoyable than the crude masturbatory imagery done in most fanservice-inducing series or specials; and in this respect, I think Neko does a decent job at providing enough fanservice to stay true to the novel and pander to fans, but not so much that it completely bars one from enjoying the story or characters. 
Character development-wise, the story explores Araragi's love for Hanekawa in great detail, as he questions whether his newfound love is one based on romance or one based on lust. There is certainly a plethora of great analysis here given Neko's connection to Bake and Nisemonogatari. For one, we have a clear juxtaposition between Araragi's relationship with Hanekawa and his relationship with Senjougahara. In Neko, for instance, Araragi discusses Hanekawa's cat problem with Oshino, and Araragi promptly asserts, ""Only she can save herself."" And yet in early Bake, Araragi discusses Senjougahara's crab problem with Oshino, and it is not Araragi but Oshino who spouts the very same line. Is Araragi perhaps more willing to save Senjougahara than Hanekawa? More interestingly enough, this becomes ironically subverted: Senjougahara essentially overcomes her crab problem by her conviction alone, while Hanekawa overcomes her cat problem not by her own will, but by direct intervention from Araragi himself (well, technically it was Shinobu but you get the point). 
Hanekawa's development alone is also quite strong, though little can be said without spoilers. In a very early scene where Hanekawa explains to Araragi why her step-father hit her, she undermines herself in her step-father's defense, saying that she was a ""seventeen-year old that speaks like she knows everything,"" a subversion of her very well-known catchphrase, ""I don't know everything, I just know what I know."" Ah, what a woman. 
Other supporting characters get a fair amount of detail as well. While Nekomonogatari features a smaller supporting cast (for continuity's sake), this is actually quite convenient given the limited -- minutes, as Neko doesn't have to deal with adding short fanservice cameos to every single character in existence. This isn't to say that Nekomonogatari doesn't suffer from this problem however, as Karen makes an awfully short cameo with a small role in the story and a big role in the fanservice. 
At the very least, however, the rest of the supporting cast get their just deserts. We get some much needed interaction with Tsukihi, who was largely lacking in Nisemonogatari as her sister Karen took up almost all the spotlight—even in Tsukihi's own arc! Oshino also makes a few great cameos in Neko, and it's interesting to see his character again considering the discussion surrounding his philosophy from Nise's finale. And perhaps an even more vital character, Shinobu gets a good deal of much needed air time as well. With her intimidating yet all the more cute capriciousness, she continues to be the looming lolicon vampire guardian that we've all come to love from the past two seasons, possibly the most fleshed-out character of the supporting cast. While she still hasn't gotten the attention she deserves as a prospective main lead, it will certainly be interesting how her role will play out in the events of Kizumonogatari. 
Animation-wise, SHAFT artwork in general has always been controversial. Some consider it a beautifully original direction while others consider it an expensive slide show. Nekomonogatari is certainly no different than its predecessors in its production quality. As such, we get a fair share of one-liner screen slides, SHAFT head tilts, eye-cropped shots, and outrageously comical blown-up views to make the current situation more over the top than it already is. The series can immediately shift from cheaply made --second-long stills to the most beautifully hand-animated artworks in existence, taking the ""sudden shift in art style"" trope to the utter extreme. Nekomonogatari's attention to detail here is excellent, with a vibrant array of colors and overall strong use in appropriating the lighting and physical setting to suit the current atmosphere. Really, if you've watched the previous installments or any modern SHAFT work, then you know exactly what to expect, and at the very least, it's undisputedly better than two talking heads in a fixed panned-out shot. Whether you're a fan of SHAFT's eccentricities or not, animation style is all about complementing and enhancing the story, and a dialogue-heavy series—however good the script may be—just wouldn't be all too compelling without fresh ways to keep viewers piqued. 
Suitably in that regard, it is even more vital that the seiyuus do an excellent job at conveying proper emotion and keeping viewers entertained. And Nekomongatari certainly doesn't disappoint, employing the same brilliant cast. The soundtrack is pretty decent, and as with Bakemonogatari arcs and their respective OPs, Nekomonogatari's OP ""perfect slumbers"" is composed by Satoru Kosaki, lyrics by meg rock, and vocals by Hanekawa's seiyuu Yui Horie. It's a nice mellow tune featuring the beautiful Hanekawa, with a soothing yet melancholic mood revolved around loneliness. Dire fans (and/or the masochist-equivalent) may recognize that SHAFT certainly loves its train tracks and vibrant geometric imagery, and ""perfect slumbers"" is no slouch on either account. 
All in all, Nekomonogatari doesn't do much different from its two predecessors, combining a Bakemonogatari-like storyline with a more sexually charged dialogue and more rampant fanservice suitable to Nisemonogatari. And for a four-episode prequel, Neko does a great job at handling a focused cast and molding their characterization and relationships to fit its congruity with the rest of the series.

I have nothing bad to say about this anime. I loved it from start to finish. 
I loved the friendship between the two main characters, and the music was great. I'm not in jazz, but I really enjoyed the music.  
The anime left me feeling happy after watching every episode.. I still have a few episodes to go before I have completed this anime, and I am dreading it.. I don't want it to end.. but I know that if I have the time, I will be rewatching it. :) 
The characters, the art, the music and everything else were great and to my tastes and liking. I would highly reccomend this anime to any anime fan. :)

A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch. 
Mushishi is comprised of a bunch of episodic adventures where each episode follows its own mini story of, Ginko's encounters with the natural phenomenon known as Mushi. Each heartfelt episode manages to cleverly bring a great deal of drama involving different types of Mushi, with different problems, and there are episodes that stand out from the rest. It's pretty unique how this anime is set out like -- different Japanese folktales, which is a welcome change from the usual anime. 
Having every episode telling a different story there's always something new to expect however this also means that there are new characters to every episode. With only Ginko being the only character to appear throughout the series it's pretty hard to get emotionally attached to any of them but at least they make the most out of the time they have. 
Mushishi has some superb animation, which successfully makes the most out of the earth look and colors. So much detail is put into the environment; water and ambient lighting that even the slightly dull premise of the show can be easily overlooked. The music is a tranquil selection of guitar and age-old Japanese tunes that suit the calm nature of the show. Both the animation and music are the aspects that allow the viewer to be immersed into this deeply, compelling show. 
Overall Mushishi is a pretty amazing anime, with no beginning or end but just a collection of adventurous stories. It manages to bring something new to the saturated anime market, without any use of gimmicks. With all that said the only real reason why I didn't rate this any higher was due to the lack of everything; apart from adventure, mystery and storytelling. So this show really isn't suitable for people who require action, romance or anything thrilling in their shows, because Mushishi is really something that you can kick back and relax to.

Its literally one of the most kickass, not to mention ""refreshing"" series i've atched along with cowboy bepop, samurai champloo and similar others. I LOVE this anime because the female lead has been through a rough past and the way her character develops through the anime is quite amazing to watch!  
Not to mention the defenseless sidekick ""rock"" who is another great character and he like voices out the opinions and explains the situation and the way it unfolds. There was an initial friction between revy and rock but they make a great partnership. Honestly i wish more people are watching this anime ugh, its so frigging good GODDAMN IT UGH I WISH THEY'D MAKE MORE SERIES AND OVAS SOON!  
Im currently on s- and i have - ova series and the specials to catch up to T_T I DONT WANT IT TO END!!!! Also another great thing is that the episode leads on and you're left wondering how theyre going to sort this mess out and its actually pretty interesting and the by the time i realised it, i finished the first series?!?!?! SIMPLY FANTASTIC JFC

One Of My First Reviews  
Ok so Hack SIGN  
A show that had a really good idea I mean I liked the Conflict of this show but , what I didn't like was how tedious and boring each episode was I didn't feel that engaged with the story i felt more like i was watching it just to finish it and see how it ended.  
Which Brings me to a positive on this show. 
After sitting through it all you do get a satisfying ending which is a plus. 
But this Anime could of been a -- episode anime and been less dragged out. 
The Art of the Anime wasn't that bad i personally liked that and the character designs that is one cool thing about hack 
The Characters The Main character was interesting and at times I couldn't stand him but his role and the whole plot with him was interesting and can be enjoyed. 
But some of the Others say the villain like character Sora every time he made an appearance I just couldn't stand him and the chesey remarks he made it felt like i was watching -kids  he his like this regardless of jap or english dub  
But i do suggest Japanese 
The Character Bear is an interesting character and Ii like his role in the story  
Enjoyment that is the main criticism I have and I'm not comparing this to Sword Art or Any other anime But hack isn't that enjoyable and it does have a really slow progression and it feels like you could skip and episode and only miss something minor , personally I haven't been this  Bored during an Anime since Naruto Fillers 
Overall I would Give this a -  Maybe I need to play the games to like this Anime More Maybe not

This was one of the most confusing shows I've seen, and one that left many questions unanswered. Some things are given as facts, but there's no explanation as to why that's the way things are. Instead, the viewer just needs to accept everything at face value and try to enjoy it for what it is: yet another mecha anime. And as Trigger is wont to do, all things must involve giant robots. 
Some spoilers: 
So we've got people who fly into computers and get transformed into parts of a giant robot. Why? Who knows! 
Where did the people with black suits come from? Who are they and why do they have anything to do with Gridman? 
Who or what is Gridman anyways? Is it an AI, alien, other-dimensional being, etc? 
Where did Akane get her powers? From Alexis? Where did Alexis come from and what even is it? 
Where did the Kaiju girl come from? What's her deal here? 
Is nothing actually real? Just some dream or simulation of an anxious IRL girl? 
There's many more questions than that. But at least the art and music were generally good. Characters were pretty flat in the personality department. And giant robots fighting giant kaiju gets repetitive.

“I want to know what “I love you“ means“ — Violet Evergarden  
Story  
Violet Evergarden tells the story about a young girl, Violet, trying to figure out the meaning behind people’s words and the impact they can have on ones life. The story starts off very slowly but quickly turns into an emotional roller coaster. In each episode Violet is trusted with the task to deliver a letter to a customer and with each letter she learns the true importance of expressing one's self.  
Only knowing war Violet finds it challenging to understand the feelings behind what people say but through her countless encounters with others and the problems they face she begins to understand not only others but herself, as well. The messages or words exchanged don’t always consist of only kindness and happiness but also of sadness and sorrow. The story is not only about learning what love means but the large variety of human emotions.  
Art  
After watching the PV for this anime the art was mainly the reason I started watching it. Breathtaking scenery and character design. Not only landscapes were portrayed with so much detail but also the cities Violet visits on her adventures. It truly has a soothing effect on the eyes. Nothing less from Kyoto Animation.  
Sound 
The Opening and Endings got me hooked from the first time I heard them. The singers of Sincerely and Michishirube are amazing and not to mention the composer, as well. The soundtracks during the series are beautiful, as well. They contribute a whole lot to set the atmosphere and the mood of the series.  
Character 
One of the most notable feats of Violet Evergarden are the characters. The character development Violet and her customers show is amazing. Throughout the story Violet learns emotions such as happiness and sadness, which helps her to understand and communicate with the people around her. In the beginning Violet can be described as an emotionless doll, who knows nothing about human relations but through her many experiences learns to express herself. It is also great how the side characters/customers show so much development just from the beginning towards the end of just a single episode without it feeling rushed or forced.  
Enjoyment 
Seriously this show is really amazing. Right after completing this piece of art I wished I could erase my memories of it, so I could watch it again for the first time. For me personally this certainly is a masterpiece.

(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
[Synopsis]:  Twenty years ago, the Kabane inexplicably appeared – undead, humanoid monsters possessing an infectious bite and an iron cage around their hearts. Their aggressive and resilient nature quickly pushed humanity to the brink, forcing them to flee behind the walls of fortress-esque stations connected by a network of rails and ironclad locomotives. When the walls of Aragane station are breached by an out of control train and it is overrun by Kabane, a young engineer named Ikoma (Hatanaka Tasuku) is forced to fight for his life and has a chance encounter with Mumei (Senbongi Sayaka), a girl who is neither Kabane nor entirely human. 
[Characters]: 
Perhaps Kabaneri’s most overwhelming weakness was its frustrating cast of characters and their individual characterization. Though there are a handful of outlying characters that are introduced later in the show, Kabaneri focuses primarily upon the crew of the Koutetsujou – the titular, armored train that hails from the Aragane station. There are several characters of at least some import within the crew however whatever convictions or goals they have are ultimately pretty dismissible due to plot revolving so heavily around the Kabaneri Ikoma and Mumei. 
Ikoma is quite a mixed bag in that, he possesses a number of traits that feel over-typical of  a protagonist such as his stereotypical revenge story and never-back-down personality however he also exhibits a few refreshing characteristics. His guilt ridden conscience in both abandoning his sister to the Kabane years ago as well as his station’s abandonment of other people speaks well to his initial cynicism and underlying anger. These traits back up his otherwise conventional quality of facing his problems head on and at least gives the viewer something to chew on when the story starts out. Unfortunately for Ikoma, whatever interesting ideologies or quirks he at first possesses are quickly forgotten for the most part as the show blunders forward and he receives very little in terms of meaningful development. 
Mumei is a different story altogether and has her own unique set of problems. Kabaneri attempts to establish her as a young and arrogant girl who slowly, over the course of her journey, opens up to others however this is executed rather ineffectively. Her propensity for changing her personality from scene to scene makes her feel very inconsistent as she switches constantly from impulsive to sincere to uncooperative. Mumei at her core represents what is probably the biggest singular issue within the cast which is their staggering lack of communication. Many issues that arise within the plot are almost solely to blame on Mumei’s own failure to communicate either what she is doing or what important information she knows. This results in the many dilemmas and developments born out of this miscommunication to feel frustrating and avoidable and many of the cast members are guilty of this beyond Mumei. People act how they want when they want and fail to convey themselves properly despite being contextualized as intelligent people. 
The rest of the cast doesn’t offer much in order to make up for Kabaneri’s lackluster protagonists. The show initially paints the elders and nobility of the Aragane station as hardheaded and superstitious in order to develop an ‘Us versus Them’ scenario where we can more easily sympathize with Ikoma’s plight. This leaves them feeling one-dimensional and unhelpful before they eventually fade into the show’s backdrop. The antagonist is similarly problematic in that, though his reasons and goals have some legitimacy about them, Kabaneri does a horrific job in conveying what they are to the viewer and he ultimately appears cartoonishly evil in how he behaves – manipulating children and scheming genocide. 
[Art/Animation]: 
With the advent of Kabaneri, the show marks Wit Studio’s third stab at the post-apocalyptic monster story after Shingeki no Kyojin and Owari no Seraph. Given the studio’s familiarity with the premise, especially of the former, Kabaneri’s visuals are its singular worthwhile attribute. The first episode does well in exhibiting the kind of steampunk atmosphere and art style used by the show and with a couple flashy action sequences, promises impressive quality going forward. What’s more is that the quality is pretty consistent and between the feudal, steampunk environment and the action animation, the show is visually pretty entertaining to watch. 
[Story]: 
Were it not for Kabaneri’s generally frustrating cast and lack of compelling characters, the story would certainly represent its biggest issue. After their station is overrun with Kabane, Ikoma and Mumei as well as the remaining nobility and the rest of its residents flee on the Koutetsujou in hopes of making it safely to another station. Though its first episode is rather exciting and compelling, the plot slows to a crawl and stagnates significantly afterwards. Kabaneri doesn’t visit more than - or - locations and despite the constant action and conflict the show itself is rather uneventful. Combine this with the show’s other issues of poorly implemented plot devices, a generally predicable progression of events, plot contrivances, and a cast full of infuriating characters and the show as a whole becomes uninteresting and disappointing. 
The Kabaneri – the half-human, half-Kabane hybrids capable of inhuman strength and speed are effectively the heart of the show as they are integral to the plot and an important trait of it’s main characters. The way their abilities are executed however presents an additional problem for the show. The Kabane, outside of their zombie-esque ability to ‘turn’ other people, are defined by their resilience – to the point that Ikoma’s development of a pressurized gun capable of punching through the iron cage surrounding their heart is a notable development and achievement. 
When Mumei is then shown capable of dispatching entire groups of them almost effortlessly it sacrifices some of the tension of the show in exchange for a cinematic experience. Ikoma often exhibits the Kabaneri’s regenerative properties as well and as he pulls through each near-death experience, his and Mumei’s own fortitude further weakens the show’s tension. 
In a similar way, the Kabane themselves too are characterized problematically. What is initially kind of a refreshing zombie design turns into something more as each episode reveals more and more features of the Kabane. As we learn more about them, what they are capable of grows steadily more and more outlandish and by the end of the show it is hard to say what the Kabane can and can’t do. This uncertain characteristic makes them feel too flexible to the situation as if they would become capable of whatever the story wanted them to be or what ever would be most theatrically pleasing. 
[Music]: 
While the presence of Sawano Hiroyuki is typically reason-alone enough to pick up a show, his appearance here does very little to alleviate Kabaneri’s problematic elements. While the soundtrack is exactly what you would expect out of him, it delivers only the most typical attributes of his style – many of the songs sounding completely indistinguishable from one another and collectively more akin to a continuous bridge than anything else. Barring the intermittent use of a few insert songs, the soundtrack was rather forgettable though fans of Sawano’s music should enjoy it just fine. 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
Kabaneri is a visually exhilarating experience littered with poor writing and bad characters. The plot was slow to arrive at any interesting events, the cast was frustrating in how they conversed and dealt with one another, and the latter half of the show exacerbated the issues it had run into early on. 
Rating: - 
I gave Kabaneri a - because it suffered from numerous issues with its only beneficial trait being its flashy, visual presentation. The characters acted like idiots giving way to frustrating developments and foreseeable outcomes. The story was poorly written and involved far too many awkward plot contrivances to actually evoke any of the drama or tension it was aiming for. 
[Recommendations]: 
I would recommend Kabaneri primarily based upon its subject matter of post-apocalyptic human versus monster survival. It’s quite similar to other shows that share a comparable premise to it and those that enjoyed those shows will likely be entertained by Kabaneri as well. While it leaves a lot to be desired in the writing and character departments, its a pretty decent action show if your aim is to sit back and enjoy the explosions.

One of my issues with Modern Anime is that they lack sophistication when it comes to the story and dealing with various subject matters. Characters in newer anime tend to be clichés with no depth or psychological complexity. Plots lack self-awareness and cling to contrived plot-devices, for the sake of setting up epic battles or shocking plot twists. Overall, they lack any sense of realism and creativity, as they force unrealistic character choices and situations.  
Unfortunately, Re:Zero is one of those animes. While Subaru has been hailed as a realistic character by it’s fanbase, I don’t believe this to be the case at all. His psychology makes no sense at all as he comes off as unrealistic, inconsistent, and just plain dumb for the sake of being dumb. The rest of the cast isn’t that great either as many of them are just one-dimensional characters, with many of the females either being loli’s or considered “cute waifus” by some.  
Characterization (-/--)  
The characters in this anime, for the most part, are terrible. None of the characters have any complex or nuanced views (especially those that challenge moral and ethical boundaries). Good characters are creative in the sense that they challenge the audience to think about topics from certain perspective that they never realized.  
Before speaking about Subaru, I do want to speak about the characters in general first. One example I want to bring up is the Royal Selection episodes, which really did a crime on the characterization of some of the major characters. It could have been a great opportunity to showcase a cast of characters fleshing out their life philosophy and how they could solve the ills of their world. Instead, it ended up being a showcase of waifus. Some of the Royal Selection Candidates completely blurted out their thinking and admit to being downright greedy and selfish, without thinking about the consequences of their words. Even Donald Trump, who is known for being extremely bombastic, is better at being a politician than most of the Candidates as he knows how to attract voters and market himself. Additionally, one of the characters (Felt) didn't even want to be there so I don't understand what the point of even writing her in was, if she's not going to provide any depth to the scene. Of course, this doesn’t matter to some as them being cute suffices enough. While Crusch was the only character to show some sanity (as she wants to change how the world is governed), it’s not enough to salvage whatever is left of this scene. Unfortunately, things get worse once Subaru starts opening his mouth.  
From season -, we can see that the purpose of Subaru’s character is to show that any “otaku or NEET” character can succeed, no matter how imperfect they are. However, the show doesn’t accomplish this too well. Subaru comes off as extremely naive, to the point that I get the impression that he hasn’t properly developed any level of emotional comprehension. He never engages in any level of critical thinking. While it’s understandable that one may want to portray Subaru as someone who isn’t perfect, the writers really take it to the point where it just comes off as forced and unrealistic (as with most executions in this series). When he first enters the world of Lugunica, he never sits back and really think about how he came into this world. He just nonchalantly accepts it, thinking it’s a dream or some sort of video game. Even when he goes through his terrible experiences, he never thinks back about how he’s even came to this world nor does he ever experience some level of homesickness. I mean, even if his modern life sucks, it should at least be better than a medieval world where people’s idea of morality is not nearly as advanced as how we understand morality today. Another example of his ignorance is when he first meets Rem and Ram. His first few meetings with them results in them killing him a few times. While Subaru is initially terrified of them, after having some bonding moments with them, he somehow grows enamored towards them, somehow forgetting that they have butchered him in cold blood in the past few days. If Subaru was more realistic, he would have never forgiven them for what they did to him, or he would be extremely cautious. It would have made more sense if Subaru was only pretending to be their friend for his own survival, as he would have people he could live with and be sheltered (he could have forgiven them down the line but I’d expect it would take ages for that to happened at best).  
Getting back to the Royal Selection episodes, Subaru’s character really goes downhill from there. Subaru acts completely goofy during the Royal Selection Meeting, even after being told by Emilia to keep quiet. He has no professionalism whatsoever, which again shows his lack of understanding his environment. When Subaru yells at the nobles for discriminating against Emillia, it’s understandable that he would do this as he is trying to stand up for her. The problem is what happens after, which is when Subaru proclaims himself as Emillia’s Knight, while doing a cringey pose. It doesn’t make sense to me why Subaru would do this, as he just comes off as narcissistic and self-centered, especially after protecting Emilia’s. He goes from being self-less to selfish in a manner of minutes. Not only does this show character inconsistency but it also shows an inconsistency in the show’s tone because it awkwardly shifts between a serious and comedic tone. It’s hard to know whether to take this scene seriously or not.  
It’s not until episode -- that he realizes that what he did in the episodes preceding it were arrogant and dumb, as if it was never obvious. While this scene has been praised as one of Subaru’s best moments (in some cases, it may be), it really doesn’t hold any value because all he really said was common sense. It wouldn’t have come to this if the writing was decent. Therefore, I find it hard to sympathize with Subaru because he’s just so stupid and naive to the point that it’s nearly unrealistic for someone his age to be that dense. I’m not expecting Subaru to be Einstein or anything. But he should at least engage in some form of critical thinking more often and have a more logical thought process. I’m not advocating that Subaru could swiftly solve his problems much faster (although this is true to some extent), but at least his decisions and choices could potentially be more realistic.  
Story and Plot (-/--)  
A story’s character and plot go hand-and-hand. A Mediocre cast of characters compromises the story as it will struggle to resolve logically if illogical choices and actions are initiated by the characters (hence why plot conveniences tend to happen). Because of this, the plot engages in literary gymnastics to try to deal with this. A good plot takes time to craft and perfect. However, what we see here is nothing short of a mess as a result of lazy writing.  
As I’ve mentioned before, Re:Zero shows a lack of self-awareness within the world itself. It’s hard to take this show seriously. The show doesn’t question any events or character behaviors that would come off as illogical or implausible (especially in terms of choices the characters make). A well-written plot consists of a series of events and elements that come together logically, which allow for a greater level of impact and realism. The Royal Election episodes, which I’ve used as an example throughout, is a victim of this issue, as the various scenes that take place make no sense. The writers should have done more in-depth research on medieval politics, which could have helped make the scene more realistic. 
Another example of this is the Whale Arc. Subaru somehow convinces everyone that a whale is about to attack all the villages, just simply by “yelling” at each of the candidates. Typically, to form alliances, you would expect some politics to be played here in the form of strategic diplomacy.  All he really does is beg and cry that a whale is going to come and attack. His feelings are understandable but in a real-life situation, he would come off as being crazy, as he didn’t have proof for his actions. But somehow, everyone found it in their heart to accept what he says. The plot never forces Subaru to really engage in any productive and/or reproductive thinking. He can be as much of a simpleton as he wants, and the plot will somehow work itself out to ensure Subaru achieves his goals. Again, this compromises the story because you are sacrificing logic and realism for plot-convenience.  
The last aspect of the plot I want to talk about is the “Return by Death” plot device, which facilitated Subaru’s “Trauma” resulting from the various death’s he experiences throughout the story. We really don’t know much about the origins of his ability, which may not ruin the integrity of the story. However, the fact that we don’t know how the reset point is determined creates an opportunity to contrive the plot, as the writers can bring back Subaru to any point in time. This sacrifices the consequences of some of his actions as he can just do everything from the beginning of a reset point. While it does provide an opportunity for Subaru to develop some emotional complexity, as a result of his constant deaths, the issue ends up being that he only suffers from Trauma in the short term. After an antagonist is defeated, his mindset stays in-tact as if he never went through the horrible things we see him go through. He doesn’t know any long-term effects of PTSD and his mental facilities seem in place until he dies again. PTSD doesn’t always last a long time but for someone who experiences death repeatedly, you would expect that at some point down the line, his mental facilitates would go completely out-of-whack. No normal person can handle what Subaru did and stay sane for long.  
Worldbuilding (-/--): 
The worldbuilding is important for a story as it is essentially a backdrop for the plot. Therefore, it’s important to really flesh out the worldbuilding. It shouldn’t just include people, places and things, but should also include the philosophy that drives the regions of that world, as well as the political, social and economic aspects of each place within that world.  
With regards to Re:Zero, the worldbuilding is very basic and very surface level. We know the world is governed by one dragon, although we don’t know the exact nature of the politics of the world. We also know that there is discrimination within that world, specifically towards elves. Bringing it back to the “Royal Selection”, this would have been a good opportunity to really flesh out the political aspects of this world. 
While we have a general idea of the world, that’s really where the worldbuilding ends. We don’t really have an idea of what individual villages and cities are like from a political or economic aspect.  And in -- episodes, a lot more could have been done. Heck, I’ve watched short OVA series that are less than half the length of S- and they manage to have more worldbuilding than Re:Zero.  
Final Thoughts (Final Score - -/--): 
Unfortunately, Re:Zero’s narrative fails at being anything worth taking seriously. The plot and characters have too much going on and lack any level of realism, and the world is largely empty. If you want to spend your weekend’s watching something gruesome and entertaining, I would recommend Re:Zero just for that. However, if you want a strong narrative, there are other places to look. For a good Isekai anime, I would recommend either Escaflowne or Dunbine.

the fma series is very popular in both the original and the re-adaptation and i can say I'm one of those fans. although most reviews go into detail ill keep it short.  
This movie is - hours wasted of your time. the ""plot"" is not connected to the main story and the premise is based around the philosopher's stone (or the star of milos in this movie.) the animation and sound was good enough for any casual fan to get by but the plot was absolutely dreadful due to uninteresting characters being boring and never leaving an impression. the climax was decent as it did have a plot twist later to be twisted out of control by revealing the character had been alive this whole time.  
Basically stay away from all fma movies as they will leave you as hollow as alphonse.

I really like Code Geass. There is nothing I can do about it. The first season was nearly perfect for me, the only outstanding flaw was the excessive fanservice.  
Now, on the second season, the fanservice is toned down somewhat, as well as the gory scenes, but they are still there. So, is it better than the first? Not really. 
My main complaint was the story.  The writers did so much built up in the first season for matters  like the Sword of Akasha and the origin of Geass, the true motifs of the Emperorand  the truth behind Lelouch's mother's death. You'll get the answers for most of this questions , but they will be ultimately dumb answers. It's like, you get yourself so worked up and then ""HUH? ALL THAT FUSS FOR THIS...THIS..."" It's that dissapointing. Some characters were killed seemingly just for dramatic effect, and others  would switch sides and change their ideologies for the most stupid reasons! 
The ending absolutely rocked though.

I originally thought i was going to see some show that was going to not be worth the time. But after episode -, i really was focused into the show. I've never felt such surges of emotions go through me just watching a Anime. I'm not even kidding, there was some points, that i actually screamed because i lost complete sense of reality for a moment. I seriously was amazed at this show. This is one of few Animes i ever have taken the time to write a review about, especially a full --/--. I felt the sound was perfect. Not to much music, mood was kept well, i even found the constant Line hum to be something that added very well to the realism. If you want to watch this show, I recommend you do all the episodes at once(-.- hours), and make sure nothing distracts you while watching. if you do, you actually will feel very into the show, and you'll feel some unbelievable effects. I seriously am having trouble trying to sleep as i have the constant quotes flying through my head. So to end this review, i'ts probably one of the best Animes I've ever seen.

DanMachi is a show that doesn't try to be much of anything other than a decently entertaining watch to pass the time (and to drum up light novel sales, but that's another story).  
The story is nothing to write home about. To try and make it seem like DanMachi is doing something original with the players getting trapped in a video game premise, because for all intents and purposes, the real world IS the video game. Granted, it is fairly interesting seeing simple gaming terms such as leveling up and skills being name dropped in a setting that isn't actually a video game, but it still doesn't make it any more original. I really do like the setting though. It isn't that much more special than your typical anime fantasy setting, but it coincides well with other plot points such as the gods and goddesses.  
The actual plot is about as simple as you can get. Our main character, Bell Cranel, wants to become a hero and get stronger so a girl who was much stronger than him at ep - will respect and fall in love with him. No seriously, that's it. You really can't get much more of a paper thin plot than that.  
The characters are actually worse off than the story if you can believe it. Bell Cranel has many noticeable character flaws, but to his credit, there are some things done to alleviate a few of his problems. Even though he is extremely overpowered after a while, and a bunch of stupid powerful skills and weapons get asspulled out of nowhere to make him ever more powerful, the simple fact that he starts off with basically nothing makes him a little better off. He and his goddess, Hestia, have little to nothing, and his determination to get off the ground and get stronger makes the whole ""become a hero"" plot thing have more humility and humbleness. Unfortunately, there isn't really anything to alleviate his massive case of harem syndrome, where almost every single female (keep in mind most of the cast is female, probably to drive home this sole fact) has at least a crush on him. It's silly and unrealistic, but there isn't much you can do with a harem to begin with, so I won't harp on it too much. 
Hestia was the talk of the town in the anime community for a while with her character design. Apparently combining big boobs with the loli stature and a boob ribbon makes for a riveting character. She does get some decent development early on with her earnest dedication to help Bell as much as she can, but loses lots of screentime after the halfway point, making her character feel fairly insignificant as time goes on. 
Other than that, there is an incredibly large cast of characters, and many of them have little to nothing other than their standard sole character trait, but I'll quickly explain my thoughts on some of the more prominent ones.  
I think they went too far with Lili to the point where I couldn't reason with her actions even though they were explained. I get her lack of trust, but it doesn't make sense to me that she would still try to actively hurt Bell after how honest Bell was (Bell was stupid about the situation too, but it kind of comes with the territory with characters of his nature).  
Welf's whole thing with magic weapons didn't really make sense. 
Quiet characters can make some of the best characters if written well, and Aiz wasn't interesting. She was just plain boring. Ryu was a little better off, but not by much. 
For the most part, the art looks like typical J.C. Staff fare. That's not really a bad thing, it just has that very soft and faint look that a lot of there shows have. The animation definitely has it's high points though. There weren't many, but there were a couple of fight scenes were really well choreographed with great use of camera work. Bell's fight with a minotaur was easily the best part of the whole series because it not only utilized those elements well, it also created perfect tension. I mean, you know Bell is gonna win, but it certainly doesn't hinder your show to give him a losing perspective from time to time, now does it? 
Even though the show doesn't try to do much, and also has a great deal of flaws, I still managed to enjoy it for what it was. Even though the story and characters were weak, the simple fact of it being set in a fantasy world with game mechanics and some good fight scenes makes even the most mediocre of shows such as this still bearable. Call me a pleb if you must, but sometimes I just can't help myself. I still wouldn't really recommend this to most people unless you are like me and just like the idea of RPG anime.

One of the best romance reverse harem ever!!! I love the story, characters, everything. I only started watching this year and I lost my childhood anime . My childhood anime should be added by this but no, I started way too late. 
The Opening Song is great. I always listen to it if there's nothing to listen and I recall some events of the anime while listening to the song. It's so good and catchy. The characters are very likeable and funny. The comedic moments are so funny that I forgot my troubles and the time I consumed while watching this anime. The romance vibe is also good. I ship Haruhi x Hikaru. Haters gonna hate. 
Please there be a second season. The anime stopped at a cliffhanger.

they [the Shinigami and Soul] pursue the highest levels of soul music with the requirement to take -- soul-eating demon soul [Kishin] and - witch soul, candidates Shinigami nurtured in a Shinigami technical school  
beginning of the story is about shinigami candidate Maka Albarn with his soul which is called Soul Eater previously mengabil Kishin soul into ----, unfortunately when he was about to take a soul witch with a cat he was wrong magic user who caused them to fall on the three lowest order in school these ...  
because then fell on the three lowest order in the school, he entered with the lowest order of the other two are held by [asassin] Black Star and his soul Tsubaki [-stance stance stance they resemble a ninja]. Black Star reasons not even the acquisition of increased level of his soul aka zero-zero for only one reason as he often violates the rules asassin asassin so often knew where the target  
another character is a child of the same which Shinigami-Death the Kid, the gun user intangible soul twin sisters Patty and Liz Thompson. kid always bragged about the beauty of all things smelly symmetrical though actually more visible as a maniac symmetry ^ ^  
unfortunately, it is definitely not always protested he was actually born with hair ga symmetry [cuz like a zebra cross ^ ^ a]  
plus he also frequently complained that his second soul is also not the only high-symmetry because other than a tiny haha ^ ^  
kid gets the lowest order of the reasons was because he was reluctant to destroy something that symmetry although it was a Kishin  
and the adventures they continue ...  
sorry^ ^ a good story  
if you like action, comedy and the supernatural ...  
I rekomenin to follow because the story was nicely spiced plus hilarious behavior of each charanya ~

I find this one of the most difficult animes to get through out of the list of animes on my currently watching list. Screw the helpful/not helpful rating on the reviews, that shit doesn't do anything to bring justice to what which animes are really worth it. Regardless of whatever future rating this review may have, please just read this before you just disappoint yourself watching this anime. 
There is no story. There isn't anything. No character development, you won't know what's happening most of the time, you don't see what you think would make this anime progress towards the better ,you will fail to see the purpose of why anything is happening and how this is entertaining you like a good anime should. 
It's like the people making this forgot that anime was supposed to be fun. 
They don't give us anything to laugh at, no heroes, no villains. The dialogue is a bunch of cheesy crap, space prate largo which feels really pointless and stupid at times. 
You will not care for any of the characters, what their pasts are, what their motivation is. They're FLAT, and I mean, FLAT, they are the closest thing to non-existence as far as purpose goes. Why are they there? Because they need heads to make a crew for this retarded space voyage. People just come out of nowhere and expect to be some important part in the story, and in the end... 
You just don't give a shit. 
If they haven't deprived us of enough of our time, the biggest crime in this anime is that they have girls floating around in zero gravity, wearing skirts, but NO panty shots, or a smidgen of service to relieve our dry eyes. 
The opening song is retarded, I'm on episode --, yet I still don't give a crap and have not listened to the ED. I doubt I would bring trouble upon myself to put any of the music or score in this anime to put in my Mp- Player. 
The voice acting is disappointing given the roles we have here. We have Kana Hanazawa, yet her character hardly appears in the series and when she does it's an even further disappointment given that she plays almost no part in whatever the fuck is happening in this anime. 
It still blows my mind to know that crap like this is allowed a full season (-- episodes) to melt the brains of the people who watch. 
Since I pride myself in making through an anime no matter how much of a clusterfuck it may be, I can't drop this whether it's killing my braincells or not. 
But you can still save yourself. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap, there are SO MANY MORE ANIMES THAT ARE WORTH WATCHING. WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO KILL YOURSELF OVER?

If I found this anime back when it first aired, that is in ----, I think that would open my eyes on Internet society, and how giant and important and dark this place is. Although it ages quite quickly, and while it tires, it fails to surprise you or open your eyes on some aspects of modern web culture. It depicts certain features, and to be honest, ""Serial experiments Lain"" drew me back to late --'s with all this urban and cyberpunk aesthethics. But to say the least, even though the show is -- episodes long only, for the most part I forced myself to watch further, and throughout the whole series I just waited for something to happen... I guess having thought that this anime is ""avant-garde"" and ""surreal"" blinded me a little bit and I failed to recognize, that this show is just a big old pile of concepts, that director couldn't put into mind.  
Overall: weird, slightly trippy, slow-pacing and easily forgettable anime.

I have been waiting to watch this for some time now and I finally got to do so. Let's start here with a review of the prologue. I've seen STUDIO DEEN's take on the Fate/Stay Night series and the route they too in that regard. I have to be honest and say that I quite enjoyed STUDIO DEEN's version so imagine my hype when I was about to delve into ufotable's great job on this, Fate/stay nihgt's second route, UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS. 
The Prologue is great! It gives you an artistically beautiful introduction to the world of Fate/stay night, to the main characters and through the point of view of Toosaka and details concerning her summoning of Archer and conversations that were not found in any of the other versions of Fate/stay night. 
Almost going to the end of this -- minute introductory episode, a battle ensues and such beauty and power to be viewed.. spectacular. The prologue alone was enough to get me to delve into the world of Fate/Stay night. I knew this would be one of the best. THank you ufotable & Type-moon!

This is a cult movie of the great series cowboy bepop 
the story has a lack of action but all the other elements make the movie a real outstanding film that its a must if you like the series I highly recomend you watch the series first but if you watch the movie first it will be alright 
because it is not connected with the trama in the series. 
the music its an amazing composition of yoko that makes your ears fly to the blue sky, see you cowboys.

This is a rather… odd show. It’s about a boy named Santa who has always been alone every Christmas and yet because he was born on the Eve of Christmas, he is given the name Santa. Who in their right mind would call their son Santa? Well, his neglectful parents it looks like. Then suddenly, out of know where (like almost every other romance anime out there) this girl shows up and asks him ‘want to spend the night with me?’ And thus begins are strange and odd show. Its not that this show is bad, more like predictable. 
Santa sounds rather whinny and annoying but because of Mai, I wouldn’t be surprised. Mai is extremely crazy and overly energetic. She can only create things that start with ‘San’ because she is in training. Now this doesn’t work well because in the dub, the items are not called the same in Japanese and so changes that. She can’t cook, goes overboard at times, and is rather stupid as well. At least Naru had brains, this girl doesn’t seen to have an ounce of smarts in many areas. All she really seems to know is how to be a Santa. 
In the first episode is about there first meeting, as well as them talking about Christmas and fun. Sadly, it feels very, very bland. It’s got cheesy written all over the script. It would actually be fine if they ended it there but they actually have a second episode. The second episode though… its just a excuse to see the girls in swimsuits. There was no real reason for them to have a second episode. It’s even cheesier then the first! 
The animation is rather good, though it does end up having scenes that are reused so many times. A lot of the animation is rather standard and bland half the time. Luckily, they don’t go out of their way to show breasts but they hint a lot about panty shots. 
Oh god, we get to the voices now… Although Chris Burnett is a rather nice voice and fits the character of Santa well, Brittney Karbowski is so not the part I would of picked for Mai. Her voice tends to get way to whinny and annoying the more she talks and it turns into a high pitched squeal when she’s talking to long.

Well, at first sorry about my English and if there are any mistakes. 
Brave -- is a ninja shounen anime about Sanada Yukimura and his ten heroes. 
I started to watch it becouse I like shounen, but I had not any big expectatives about it. 
When I watch the firsts episodies, I thought: 
-This is a fucking bishounen anime, man. 
-The story is pretty bad... 
-Why Isanami is so stupid? 
Etc. But I didn't drop it. Why? Well, I say to you: this anime is bad. But it's not boring. There are some bad animes that when you are watching and episode you are praying for the end. Not in Brave --. That's a good point. 
Story: - 
The plot is simple and the development is very bad. All the anime Saizou is kicking asses with Isanami screaming ""HELP ME SAIZOU!"" and criying very loudly... While this they meet new characters that will be heroes too. That' s all. 
Art: - 
The animation is good, so the fighting scenes are decent. The style is good too, but it doesn' t feel like a shounen anime (is more a choose-your-bishie style xD). 
Sound: - 
The OST is good. It isn't a OST that I will listen in my MP-, but it is good to ambientation. The opening is fucking catching (xD). 
One of the better points of this anime is the seiyuus. There are a lot a famous seiyuus in this anime (Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, etc.) so if you want to listen your favourites seiyuus this anime is a mine. 
Character: - 
There are too many character for -- episodies, and the most have no deep or development. 
I like Sanada Yukimura and Nezu Jinpachi, but there are very bad characters. For example, Isanami is the typical Mary Sue. I prefer to not talk about Kamanosuke. 
The only character that has a personality development is Saizou, but it' s a veeery typical development. 
Enjoyment: - 
As I' ve said, the enjoyment is good. I prefer the bad, simple animes that are not boring than bad, strange and stupid animes that pretend to be ""deep"" and they are only boring. 
Brave -- is not a masterpiece, but at least is fun to see. 
Overall: - 
Brave -- is a - anime, but I give it a - for the enjoyment. So, I don' t recomend this to you if you aren' t: 
-A fangirl. 
-A shounen/ninja anime super lover.

I don't really know how to review this thing, because I really disliked it. 
The story is just average for the anime of this kind (I mean hentai actually). It consists of constant blackmailing and sex scenes that follow, and I really wonder who would like it. In fact, the story could be described in a few words and it is just a small introduction to the sexual content. So let me say there is no actual story at all. I forced myself to watch it up to the end just to see what all this nonsense will finally lead to, and the ending disappointed me, too. 
The characters also were of nothing special: one bad guy and a huge tribe of frightened innocent girls who later stop being innocent. I've seen many of that kind already. 
The sound was ok, and the art reflected the atmosphere (was supposed to, at least), but imho was too dark. 
To sum up, a mediocre product that can will most likely arouse the feeling of disgust, but not pleasure from watching.

This anime is kind of slow paced with very classic characters. The story is ""ok"" but it doesnt really blow you away. (like I didnt get hooked) There are some moments however that are really good, and some episodes where they gather a lot cool moments. For a fantasy world, its really down to earth and limited in what you can expect, and kind of predicatble as well. Too slow for my taste, ok to watch if you do something else and ok to watch with kids as well, not really the typical modern day anime. I guess worth to watch if you can enjoy that sort of thing

School Rumble is my all time favorite anime series therefore my high score for it and because it actually deserves it. 
Story - Basically, School Rumble has no real storyline besides Tenma going after Karasuma and Harima going after Tenma, thats basically it. But the thing about School Rumble is, even if it barely has a storyline it still appeals to many many people, which is something i believe is unique. 
Art - I adore School Rumble's beautiful design of characters. Even though its a ---- anime, it still has considerable good graphic maybe even better then some animes in the year ----. Also one thing i find quite different in the art of school rumble is how KJ ( Kobayashi Jin, creator of school rumble) hides the good-looking appearance of some of the characters such as Harima and Hanai. 
Sound - School Rumble has one of the catchiest and most addictive OP any anime ever had 'Guru Guru Mawaru Guru Guru Mawaru....' this song just makes you want to get up dance to the melody. The ED was also very catchy as well, School Rumble's ending is one of the ONLY ones i've watched for all of the episodes. Side from the OP and ED, the voice actor/actress fitted the role very well, from cute and loving Tenma to the complete pervert Imadori, there voice seems to be made for the character. Also Horie Yui is one of my favorite voice actress so i guess that adds up to the score as well.. hehe. 
Character - Wide range of entertaining characters all which make you literally laugh out loud. They are all entertaining but they all have very unique personality from the Tsundere Ojou to the Semi-yandere Yakumo. I highly doubt you will hate any of these characters because i certainly didn't! 
Enjoyment - If i could give bonus points for enjoyment of this series, i would. First off, as stated before, this series literally makes you laugh out loud. A series that can actually make someone laugh out loud is something I'd think is freaking hilarious. Hilarious = Enjoyable... therefore School Rumble is really hilarious and enjoyable. (Yes that was lame..) 
Overall - Overall, this series is definitely something you should watch if something is really bothering you and you want to watch something fun and laugh all the pain away. Even if you like really serious stuff like Death Note, you should still try this, you never know you might actually like this genre of anime.

Darling in the Franxx was an anime I really enjoyed watching. Even though the show is filled with ups and downs I still looked forward to watching it every week. Then came episode -- and it went all the  
way down :( 
My main problem with the show besides what happens in episode -- is how long it took for Zero Two  
and Hiro to be able to pilot together with no interference. That only happens after episode -- and until then you have to deal with constant interference from Ichigo. Now I didn`t hate Ichigo so much as I just found her annoying. I always hate the type of character that loves somebody but never admits it to that person until another love interest comes along. It especially annoys me when said character proceeds to do everything in their power to stop the new relationship from growing. 
Now all that I could put aside because finally after episode -- it looked like we were headed in the right direction but episode -- just ruins it for me. I know Trigger did a plot twist in Kill La Kill too but it felt like they waited way to long in Franxx. My problem with the VIRM shit is that it felt really stupid. The whole anime sets up the members of APE as the villains that run everything behind the scenes like SEELE in Evangelion. I expected the finale to be somewhat like End of Evangelion with APE or maybe even Dr.Franxx acting like Gendo and trying to make some grand design come to fruition. Then Hiro and his friends would rebel and fight against them.  
The issue is not that the idea of VIRM is terrible. I feel like if it at least had been hinted at or shown at around the middle of the series and built from there VIRM could have been fine as the “final boss.” 
The fact that they introduce them out of nowhere like an RKO when the show is --% done just ruins any hope of me really taking it seriously. It would be like if in a video game the person who was supposed to be the final boss taunts you the whole game and right when you are about to fight them in the climax they get killed by an even stronger dude they never showed before. Also don`t get me started on how VIRM is a cheap knockoff Anti-Spiral. 
I honestly could`ve put that aside and maybe rated the show a little bit higher if the final battle had been as good as in Gurren Lagann which Franxx seemed to want to be like but we had better fights in the earlier episodes. Even the ending after the final battle was one of those super cheesy endings and felt really rushed. 
In conclusion the only thing this show really has going for it is good animation and music. Characters are kinda typical with better looking designs. The story had a lot of potential but was fucked up badly towards the end. It`s sad because I like Studio Trigger you`ll find I rated their other shows highly but they dropped the ball on this.

It repetitive and boring. I believe there are - seasons so near -- episodes of trying to kill this guy. How much can you milk this show. It should have lasted -- eps at most. 
Art 
Its there. Nothing great about it as there are no beautiful cuts. It's what I expect from a more recent anime release. 
Sound 
Same idea for the art. It's expected, but there is nothing significant as no real music cuts were fantastic. 
Character 
Each and every character bothers me. Maybe it's just me, but they are all annoying in they're own way. Also the alien guy is the most confusing character imaginable. He will destroy a world, but first he has to teach??? Like how is this logical, I get there was a promise, but how can a promise lead you to teach kids and destroy the world they live in after. 
Enjoyment 
There was none from me  
Overall 
If you enjoy seeing how many ways they can think of failed ways to kill and alien by all means watch the show. I am sure most people watched since they want to know how he dies, if he does at all, but honestly I rather just google search it to see the creative way of his death, if there is one.

It's not funny, it's just cringe inducing. All the jokes fall flat since they heavily rely on her being a mom, and nothing really else. This wears thin extremely fast, especially since they aren't clever in any way and are weirdly sexual for a relationship between a mother and a son. 
The sound design isn't bad, and might even be great, however the flaws of painting a relationship between real family in a romantic light make it hard to focus on any of the background music or sound design unless it becomes distractedly misused. 
The only redeeming part is the art style, but it's done by a doujin artist so it makes it worse with the context of this being an anime about a mom and son becoming intimate. There is a lot of lazy animation and obviously focus on making the mom look as sexy as possible to try and attract her son. It becomes hard to enjoy the sakuga and fan service of the attractive mom character, because it's difficult to see her as anything but a mom, so even it's strong point is ruined by its gross pandering and poor writing. 
The worst part though is how it forces it's ""wholesome"" message and ideals down your throat, so you can't even watch it for a purely ecchi reason. The ideals aren't even grand or thought provoking it boils down to forgiving family no matter what they do (even if it's malicious emotional and mental abuse), which is a very toxic moral to soap box, especially with the context of the character its about. 
So, I guess I only really recommend this if you are from Alabama or spend all your time on the internet jerking off to incest porn and want something to ham fist surface level morals down your throat.

Minarai Diva gained some notoriety as the first-ever live anime. Two voice actors speak unscripted with the goal of producing a new song every episode. Their movements are captured and turned into -D CG. Viewers could tweet and influence the production. 
Unfortunately, this idea is as bad as it sounds. You won't get any pleasure out of this unless you were one of the people who tweeted during the live airing. The voice actors are easily distracted and talk about pointless topics. At times, the -D CG program crashes and a ""technical difficulties"" screen is put up. Some -- minutes later, the finished songs are sung karaoke-style and sound absolutely dreadful even by bubblegum j-pop standards. 
Whatever you do, don't watch this show. This is my pick for the worst anime of the year, even worse than the much-maligned Pupa and Glasslip. At least both of those had some production value. If you want to turn off your brain and enjoy a different ED song every time, watch Super Sonico, which is infinitely better than this.

I had the opportunity to view this film in theaters. This film exceeded my expectations. The previous - films were, unfortunately, unable to stand alone. Out of the two, this was the most action-packed and climactic. I was continuously blown away by the excellent sound direction and animation. Like most Shaft anime, the last Kizumonogatari film has an avant garde method of storytelling. It might seem strange, but it works for the tone and comedy of the anime. Random clips pop out and sometimes seem disjointed, however they only add to the amazing animation. There was one scene in particular that had everyone in the theater laughing due to its strangeness and eroticism. Overall, I highly recommend this film, although it may require getting used to the animation.

Bleach is a waste of your time because it doesn't care about whatever time you put into it or whatever time you put away for it. 
It stagnates as a series and falls short of everything it attempts to accomplish by being cookie cutter and devoid of meaning. The series tries to recapture what it had laid out during the beginning but can't quite do it, giving us a skeleton of what it once was - there's no meat on Bleach's bones as a story. Ironically put, it's hollow. 
Ichigo is the only character that matters and whenever he is not on screen the series does not move forward. Every other battle simply does not matter because this is only a story about Ichigo, everyone else is literally carry-on-luggage. That being said Ichigo's character is bland, naive and short to anger making him insufferably hard to relate to. His friends and their powers are so boring that it's a mystery to why they're even included in the story itself. Simply put, they have nothing to do with it. 
During the Soul Society Arc it is Ichigo, not Chad, Orihime or Ishida that is supposed to be there. There is absolutely no reason for them to be involved. They add a stagnation to the plot, which is already slow to begin with, and take screen-time away from the main focus: saving Rukia. 
I digress, this is possibly the best Arc in the series because it shows us the motivation of Ichigo and his attachment to save someone who he is indebted to. However, including these side main characters is absolutely pointless and as the series goes on in later Arcs they will steal screen-time away from Ichigo making fight scenes last for what seems like forever. And of course when Ichigo isn't on the screen the plot doesn't move an inch. 
Bleach should've ended after the Soul Society Arc, filler proceeded it and the build for the Arrancar Arc had begun. 
The Visored are just as pointless to the plot as the side main characters, they don't need to exist and solely exist for Ichigo's advancement power-level-wise. The assault on Hueco Mundo is a cookie cutter copy and paste of the assault on the Soul Society but worse. The comic relief during this Arc is unsettling and unwatchable, forced and unwanted. There's so many fights happening at once I thought I was watching Naruto Shippuden. The writing is atrocious, the screenplay is nonexistent. This is the lowest form of media I have ever consumed. It is so fucking uninspired that in one episode the [animation] team couldn't even draw what seemed to be painted tears on a character in-between scenes, ruining her individual character design within seconds. These are simple flaws and didn't just happen once; the studio simply did not care. 
To say Bleach is bad is an understatement. It is the worst shonen I have ever seen - the quality of storytelling does not move past one character and the entire story will bottleneck itself if he isn't on screen. 
Just because it [Bleach] was one of the 'Big -' doesn't mean it was good. Perhaps people should take off their rose-tinted glasses to review a show that has --% of it's episodes dedicated to filler and one [show] that ended on a whim. 
Bleach needs to drink itself.  -.-/--

It's basically just fanservice.  
There's a lot more to say than that, but it sums up my overall position on Accel World: Infinite Burst.  
The movie begins with an approximately -- minute long recap of (mostly) the first half of the TV series. This is something I'm not a big fan of, but have seen before in anime movies tied into a TV series and I guess I can understand the intention if it's to bring the audience up to speed with the plot. I still don't agree with that choice, but I can understand it. But here it's immediately ruined by the fact that not only does the recap mostly overlook the second half of the show, but also a long series of other events only covered in the original light novels, leaving the viewer very confused as to what's happening at the start of the animation-new material in the movie if the show is all they're familiar with.  
SPOILER WARNING: major plot details follow 
These include, but may not be limited to, new characters, Sky Raker's legs having been restored, the fact that Nega Nebulus and Prominence are now one legion (???), the ability of Scarlet Rain's fortress to transform into a four-legged tank and some kind of large flatbed truck-tank thing, and the fact that it seems to have a time limit now, the fact that many characters who were previously only acquainted through the game seem to now know each other in real life and make no big deal of it (despite the fact that the importance of hiding your real life identity was stressed very heavily by Black Lotus in the TV series), and the fact that Silver Crow now throws around Incarnate abilities against AI opponents who aren't using them despite the fact that this was said to be extremely dangerous for one's mental state. I assume most or all of these are explained in the intervening light novels, but there's no explanation to be found within Infinite Burst itself (nor, on a more meta level, for why this arc was chosen to be made into a movie now when so much of its foundational material is unexplained).   
The actual plot of the movie is also rather poorly explained and rushed. The hook is solid,that a girl in the middle of a gymnastics accident accelerated into the infinite neutral field right before falling into a coma and has thus been stuck there. We learn that something's going on to disable security cameras and lock people out of parts of the accelerated world, the party gathers at a point outside of the disabled area and is able to pierce the veil using Rain's truck and the Green King's shield, and then they fight a large horde of monsters summoned by a legend-class enemy Nyx, who has apparently been summoned by the trapped gymnast, and Crow and Lotus enter her fortress and have a brief confrontation. This all has the makings of an interesting narrative with some good tension and reveals, but it goes by so fast that nothing has much weight; the new content of the movie only makes up about half of its ---minute runtime, only about -.- times the length of a single episode of the TV show. I have no idea why half of the movie was given to recap when the other half feels so rushed, but regardless of why, it severely hampers the story.  
That being said, the art and soundtrack are still great, the characters are likable for what we see of them, and some of the fights are quite well animated. Seeing this stuff in action is cool for people who already know the story, or fans of the original show that want to see more stuff from the characters they like, but as a movie it's pretty weak, and I genuinely don't understand how the same people that made the TV series, which I think has great pacing and narrative construction, could have messed up this badly on the movie. I don't really know enough about how anime is produced to speculate, and I'd love to hear an explanation if anyone has one. Overall, I wasn't expecting anything as great as I thought the show was, and I was still pretty disappointed.

In the rating system, for me, this jumped from -  to -, to -, to -, back to -, then plummeted to - at the end and never recovered. I appreciate anime's style and substance, and this series had both, sometimes enough of both to justify it's classic status. Fabulously scary, those Angels are. And what a back story--half the Earth's population killed in the second impact--that's the stuff of epics. Some of the battle sequences are breathtaking. Yet for all this, we've got the most whiny, annoying and unlikable wuss for a ""hero"". Shinji, shut up. Daddy doesn't love you? I don't blame him, you scrawny little creep. Take this plus an anticlimactic, largely incomprehensible finale (to me, anyway, kudos to anyone who could understand it), the deterioration of the primarily jovial, lively co-stars into moping basket-cases, and the oh-never-mind disposal of the last Angel. What a let-down. ""Congratulations,"" they yammer at the end. Well, thanks. I guess that's for making it through those last three episodes. This one's all over the map, and while it's got qualities to recommend it, it's got others that'll make you gnash your teeth in frustration.

The second season of Overlord is a tease for the third season of Overlord.  World building, establishing various subplots only to forget about them entirely, and power fantasy abound. 
The story does a good job of setting up S-, but a bad job at being a good story in itself.  The art is basically the same as S-, and is well animated.  However, there are parts which are pretty obvious, low to middle quality CGI.  
Characters are a little more interesting than in S-, but fail to fully flesh themselves out.  Lizardman arc ends too quickly, and there's not really a reason for the demon arc.  The arc could have been condensed into two episodes.   
It's a power fantasy that fails to create meaningful power.  If S- takes the many, many loose threads from S- then that will be a hit, but S- on its own fails to deliver.

(Spoilers) 
this anime is really a rollercoaster of emotions for me. like, i went into it thinking it was going to be a lighthearted slice of life comedy similar to an anime like Watamote or something. but i ended up watching something that was complex and very emotional. of course this is still a comedy, but this show is notorious for being pretty depressing. 
Story - - 
the concept of the story is brilliant. though this anime came out in the early ----'s, the themes of the show is much more relevant today, with so many more technology advances making more people glued at home with it. for the most part the story itself is pretty good and consistent. the biggest flaw of the story is the story arc involving the pyramid scam. the story arc goes on for - episodes and got tedious halfway through. i always found myself to be skipping these episodes when i rewatch the show. i think the reason why i dont like this arc is probably because it doesnt entirely focus on sato, and it feels like he is replaced with the blonde haired girl, who i particularly did not care for. 
Art - -  
i liked the art for the most part, but the budget drop in the show caused the show to look like dogshit for a little bit, and this was in the pyramid scam arc, making it worse. i guess this show didn't really require visuals to be fantastic, but it would have made the show better. the opening intro's visuals are really great though. 
Sound - -- 
this is my favorite aspect of the show. the music that is chosen for this show is really appropriate. some of the songs chosen in this show are fantastic and is a leading factor to what gets me so emotional when i watch this show. for example the opening theme and hitori bocchi. it somehow fits like a glove when it relates to the story. the voice acting is TOP NOTCH (japanese). sato's voice actor is terrific. at the end of the suicide pact arc, he made the saddest scream ive ever heard. another tearjerker. 
characters - - 
great characters, yup yup. i don't have many complaints, because the characters are great, not the pyramid scheme girl though FUCK HER. for the most part they have a solid chemistry. 
Enjoyment - - 
i found myself engaged to this show because of the themes that it dealt with and the terrific OST, i was also incredibly sad when the show ended.  
overall - - 
watch this show. its not for everyone, but if you're someone like me who is interested in psychological shows, but isnt interested in ones that have a very dark atmosphere to them, this show's nearly perfect without a few flaws i mentioned.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a pretty beloved show on MAL and within the anime scene in general.  Personally, while I enjoyed it, I don't necessarily think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  It kept me entertained, and even at times made me feel an emotion or two, but the slow start and sometimes dragging plot didn't necessarily keep me thinking about watching the next episode when I was busy with other activities.  That being said, it is certainly worth a watch through at least once if you have the stomach for a --+ episode series!  Let's get into the breakdown. 
Story (-/--) - I think the story was fairly well done.  It wasn't groundbreaking and it didn't necessarily have a lot of ""oh snap!"" moments, but it executed quite well.  Its exposition was usually laser focused on the characters and history that mattered, the plot was consistently moved forward to the inevitable conclusion, and you did get a sense of something grander going on.  It didn't waste your time with a ton of filler, and you could see this spiderweb of deception in every corner of the world.  The events were logical, believable, and often relateable despite being set in a fantastical world of magic, with problems often mirroring very real life scenarios. 
It also handled flashbacks remarkably well I think.  Many shows just drag flashbacks on and on.  FMA:B kept them quick and relevant.  It actually made me enjoy them and made me curious about the backstory rather than beating me over the head with historical exposition to justify everything.  My only real complaint with the story was how it dragged at the beginning while it was setting up the spider-webbing for the over-arching grand scheme.  It took nearly -- episodes to get going, but once it did get going, it took off at a brisk run.  It was a significant enough annoyance to me though that I can't give the story a - despite its pretty quality execution. 
Art (-/--) - The art was certainly above average, but it didn't really stand out in any particular way to me.  It was consistently solid, with no mistakes, but not beautiful.  It served its purpose and allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, but was short of being truly captivating.  There were definitely brief moments where it came close to being stunning though, and I have to give credit for the very eye-catching design of Pride (hah, I made a funny!). 
Sound (-/--) - I think the sound for this show was its weakest quality.  It felt to me like it was merely adequate.  It served its purpose, but nothing really was memorable to me from the soundtrack to the voicing.  My personal taste may be heavily colouring my opinion here, but I really just found the sound as action-average as any J-Pop intro to a RomCom or Ecchi. 
Characters (-/--) - Along with the story, the characters were quite well handled.  They were all very standard stereotypes, but each had their own unique quirks and motivations to keep them interesting.  I wouldn't say any were particularly deep, but there were certainly moments where I would feel for a couple characters.  I enjoyed learning about all their backstories, and I enjoyed that they all walked their own paths, or at least tried to until they were often drawn back together by fate.  Their independence was actually relateable instead of the usual excessive aloofness of ""independent"" characters in many other shows.  They genuinely felt like individuals rather than cogs in a big machine. 
Enjoyment (-/--) - At my first foray into this series, I honestly have to say I was pretty ""meh"" about it.  Up until about episode -- for me, the story dragged along as it tried to set everything up and introduce all the main players.  It sagged under the weight of it and I often found myself thinking of other things I could be doing while watching.   It was still enjoyable... just not really compelling.  Starting out this was a -/-- for me.  After episode -- though, the show finally kicked it into gear and I found my enjoyment increased *measurably*.  Middle of the show it was a -/-- and by the end it landed a -.  It's worth watching if you can make it to the end, especially considering the pleasant and fulfilling ending that so many action anime lack these days.  If I was my younger self, I could see myself having enjoyed it even more.  I can't say I'll rewatch it, by I'm certainly glad I've seen it. 
So overall I give ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" a -/--.  It was almost an -, but not quite.  Not because it did anything wrong, but more that it didn't try to push itself at all and stayed in its comfort-zone.  The story was interesting enough though and the characters did often elicit some compassion from me.  If you're reading this to figure out if you should watch this show, then sure, you'll probably find something in it worth your time (as long as you are good with --+ episodes), but be careful not to go into it with too much hype in mind.

This is a very creative new anime. You will enjoy this anime if you have an affection for action packed theatricals. I was going to give a -- but there is one problem. The characters have no backstory! 
Story: -- 
The story is about an over powered protagonist trying to make himself known to the world. He encounters having an apprentice and fighting lots of battles mostly ending in one-punch. 
Art: -- 
The art style is very well drawn with no noticeable errors. 
Sound: -- 
Excellent and this particular anime has a great sounding theme and opening songs. 
Character: - 
The protagonists are told to have very dark past and in particular the apprentice. But after one whole season we do not have any information on One-punches past at all. (I'm sure done intentionally.) All we are told is he was able to gain enormous psychical strength over - years. Also the main antagonists are not directly identified until being ""suggested"" in the last episode.  
Enjoyment: -- 
Personally I love action packed anime. Despite many similarities to DBZ, I found that this anime did not draw out needless storytelling.  
Overall: - 
As I previously stated I could not give this anime -- due to the lack of character development. I understand that the background of the characters will be revealed in the next season. But in every single T.V series I have watched where the single most important backstory is held back for so long always ends in disappointment. (LOST for example) I do not expect the next season to be better but far worse.

Are you a fan of the oft maligned cgdct (cute girls doing cute things) genre? Or do you think it's ruining anime? It doesn't matter, because A Place Further than the Universe takes a standard lighthearted slice of life formula and infuses it with narrative momentum and heart wrenching emotion in a way that keeps the fun spirit and character interactions standard to the genre while also having a strong plot driven structure that wards of the narrative stagnation that usually puts me off similar shows. 
The plot begins when Mari, a high school senior who feels she needs to do something with her life, runs into Shirase, a student at the same school who has been obsessed with finding a way to travel to Antarctica after her mother died on an expedition to the continent many years ago. Thus starts a journey of bonding, struggling, traveling, and eventually reaching and staying in that frigid continent. Along the way they pick up Hinata and Yuzuki, two other girls who end up becoming friends with them and joining them on their journey.  
As with many other shows that heavily focus on the interactions of a group of friends, a lot rides on these characters and their relationships. Fortunately, the show pulls this off excellently. Each of the four characters is unique (both from each other and from genre cliches), interesting, multifaceted, and get their own development over the course of the show. One of the things that's done particularly well is the development of their friendship. When the show starts off none of these four know each other, and while they quickly become close friends their interactions don't feel like they've suddenly turned into lifelong pals, instead we see them progressively growing closer together over the course of the show, punctuated with very human and well executed rough spots where they don't quite see eye to eye. 
A previously mentioned, the show has a strong narrative pull that leads the characters from scenario to scenario as they try to accomplish the ultimate goal of the series. This keeps things fresh and interesting, as well as providing a ton of unique locations and scenarios to put the characters into (e.g. survival training, Singapore, seasick on a boat, etc.) that allows for really cool moments and character dynamics.  
The art direction is also pretty darn good, although I admit that I'm not ---% a fan of the character style, which often seem just a tiny bit on the rough side for me. Music is also good, with some great insert songs to punctuate emotional moments, although these are soured by the same couple of songs being repeated across multiple episodes's climatic scenes. Overall, every element of the show is really well executed, although not perfect, presenting a show that's enjoyable, emotional, exciting, and just all around a solid - or - out of --... 
...Is what I would say if it wasn't for the second to last episode. Oh my god what a moment. Like the characters, we the audience have been so caught up in rooting for and following the main group's struggle and eventual success in their goal we forgot why they originally wanted to come to Antarctica. Shirase's mom. Once we get to Antarctica this fact can no longer be pushed to the side, and we see Shirase is struggling as she's forced to come to terms with the fact that she really is in Antarctica, but hasn't gotten the emotional catharsis she thought it would bring - so now what? Then, after some buildup, the show presents one of the saddest and most strangely relatable moments I've ever seen as all of these pent up emotions come crashing down.  
It uses a plot device just unexpected enough to seem like something that could really happen to shed light on how Shirase's has been continuously struggling with her loss, even when it seemed to everyone else she had gotten over it, and provides a moment of emotional catharsis that hits you (and her) right in the gut. Her mom isn't coming back. And you're probably bawling on the floor. While I admit some shows can make me teary eyed with relative ease, this is the only piece of media that has legitimately made me ugly cry. This moment elevates the already superb execution of the show into an absolute must watch, especially if you need a strong hit of some of that sad stuff. Only downside is that the actual final episode seems a little tacked on after such a well executed climax, but it does provide some good wrap up to the plot that might have felt missing otherwise.

Story 
Sword Art Online is an anime that has stood the test of time surprisingly well, just - years after this anime came out it has spawned a sequel anime and a motion picture film which came out in ---- called Ordinal Scale. The one thing I found about that film is that everyone liked it as well, which surprised me, since this anime… well the story isn’t so good. And immediately off the bat, the most noticeable problem with this anime is its random pacing. The series starts off pretty well, introducing you to the characters at a pace which is pretty normal for most kinds of anime, especially Isekai anime. Kirigaya (aka Kirito) and all of the other people logged into SAO at the time have been trapped in the game, and if they die in the game, they die in real life. Kirito we also come to find out is a master SAO player, being in the beta since the beginning and knowing virtually everything there is to know about SAO. This is all just the first three episodes or so, give or take some minor tweaks here and there. But after these initial episodes SAO’s problem of bad pacing really starts to show. Characters like Asuna are just pushed to the side in favor of building up these secondary characters which have no real meaning to the story or plot later on in the first -- episode arc. Obviously these characters are featured in the second season somewhat, but I felt this was a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation anyways. Does the show not focus on these characters to instead push forward the main story thread, or do we add these character in for that added effect in Season -.  
I don’t blame them for the decision they chose here, but it can’t be denied that these episodes focusing on characters like Asuna’s Sister (which are not important to the series) was a little too much, and in the end made you feel like you wasted your time. They had no real tangible bearing on events in the anime, sure you can say some of them gave our characters items, but in the end they more or less focused on them romancing Kirito, when you know damn well Asuna was going to be the character they chose. Honestly it all just came off really amateur to me, and short sighted. But continuing on with the pacing, for the rest of the show it’s built around Kirito and Asuna’s adventures together trying to clear all of the towers to somehow make it out of this game. This is where the show really keeps it together and has a cohesive set of characters that are both somewhat dynamic, just enough to keep you hooked, and a pretty straight forward motivations. These episodes are the most enjoyable, and memorable parts of the series more or less.  
The parts I really enjoyed about SAO all really stem from them being trapped in this game, it gives the sense that these characters only have one like, and that in turn makes for a very compelling progression for the story. I think something good that stems from this is the relationship between Kirito and Asuna. And okay, sure I get it, I hear your complaints about the arc where they hang out at a cabin, and we’ll get to that in a moment. But Kirito and Asuna’s relationship, I feel progresses at a natural and smooth rate that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. There is no wait at the end for the big kiss, and there is no shyness around these two characters that keeps the relationship from naturally progressing to extend the series even more. The relationship peaks very early on in the series, and because of this, the viewer doesn’t have to wait until the end, they get that now, and because of that Kirito and Asuna’s characters become so much more important. Kirito and Asuna now have something to live for, and that makes them all the more compelling and human. And trust me, making these characters feel more human, I’m all for, it’s another nitpick of mine, but this series has some pretty robotic characters.  
Moving on, the cabin arc is atrocious like I said, it introduces a character that basically lets them cheat in the game itself in many ways. And boy do they introduce that character terribly too, and I can’t say a lot of that because we don’t have enough time to even go into that character. But let me say this, she’s an awful boring and cringey character. Moving on the series pacing ramps up and basically hastily ends the series as we know it -- episodes in, in a very awesome fashion may I mind you, but still feeling somewhat lackluster. There was no proper build to these final moments, and because of that I felt it was unimportant. Like they had all of the answers all along, and that everything would of course end they way they did, because simply for the fact they’re our main characters. There was no surprise the way it went down, sure it was cool to see in such a dramatic fashion, it was compelling as you were watching it. But that facade slowly went away as you simply just thought about it. Why did this happen -- episodes in? There must be something better right? 
Well the rest of the series is a total and absolute mess and a dumpster fire. Asuna is trapped in a game called again, and they can take her helmet off… yet the game was shut down. This is an EXTREMELY huge plot hole right here. In the beginning they went out of there way to mention on several occasions that if they clear the game, they’re all released. Yet Asuna was never released and awakened… why? Because don’t pay attention that’s why. The show now opts to dangel our main female heroine in front of us like a trophy so that Kirito has something to fight for. But guess what, now there is no romance in the series, so let’s have Kirito’s sister fall in love with him, because incest is cool guyz. And before you mention it, I know they’re not blood related, but it’s still incest. It’s still your sister, do you people have no standards? But the series basically ends with a whimper and a thud rather than ending at episode -- like it should have. This last half, there was no reason for it to exist at all, it was a complete what of your time, and if you’re going into SAO for the first time, I strongly suggest skipping this part and going straight to the last episode. 
Characterizations 
Now moving onto characters, the show fumbles somewhat here. First off, every character that’s not Kirito and Asuna may as well be a waste of time. The main villain, the guy who started SAO, isn’t even that important, at least he doesn’t feel important. I believe this is simply because the show is so revolved around Kirito and Asuna at virtually all times, that it really needed to just be these two characters journeys, rather than his sprawling story with revolving characters that they tried so hard to make you care about. Let’s take for example Rika Shinozaki… I’m sure you remember everything she did, right? Right? Exactly, and by the way, she helped make Asuna’s sword and upgraded Kirito’s sword. But I didn’t remember that because she wasn’t important like all the others. 
But let’s talk about the lady killer, Kirito. Described as being a lone wolf gamer, he gets literally all dem chicks. Seriously, Kirito in this series gets an incredibly amount, possibly a never ending source of anime babes, and they all love him. He’s also a beta tester, and because of this he knows everything about SAO. And because of this, I’m kinda left wondering why he didn’t do more in this series, and why he had such trouble with certain monsters, but ya’ know, don’t pay attention. Kirito in basically every situation in this anime is calm and collected and knows how to deal with every situation that he may encounter. Because of this I feel his character becomes almost unrelatable if it were not for his relationship with Asuna. It just feels like he never grows or becomes stronger and remains static throughout. Because of this, I absolutely hate Kirito. He comes off as a complete asshole several times throughout the series as well, which really just makes me question why they did this. I’m all for character being evil, but when you’re MC is portrayed as the perfectly good character that fights for his woman and stuff, and then you have him be a complete self absorbed asshole… well that lets me know to never take this character seriously.  
Asuna on the other hand is this girl who is basically matching Kirito in skill in some aspects. She’s known for being very quick in combat, and because of this she finds a home in one of the strongest guilds in SAO. She’s also used in the second half as a trophy in a way for Kirito to come and save. She’s literally in a freaking castle at the very top while some generic bad guy who is trying to marry her in real life locks her away and sexually harrasses her. And let’s talk about that, how in the hell is this guy trying to marry Asuna when she can’t even consent? I know that arranged marriages are somewhat common in Japan for wealthy families, but it doesn’t make sense to me. Why keep her locked up in a game and in real life unconscious just so Kirito can come and save her? Why not let her out of the game and marry her anyways? Isn’t it already established she’s being married against her will anyways? Also this whole thing is completely ignored at the end too, so why the hell is this even a major plot point in the series second big arc? It’s almost as if they had to artificially inflate the series so they could get -- episodes. Ya’ know what, earn the -- episodes, what about that? 
Art 
Art for every A-- Picture that has anything more than a shoe string budget looks amazing, always. And this is no different in this anime either, we have insane art design from this anime that even - years after its initial release looks incredible. Immediately from the start I noticed how modern the aesthetic is for the real world and how well it blends into the game worlds fantasy setting. Small things like Taverns and Blacksmiths populate the world, and the cobblestone streets and brick buildings help make the aesthetic come to life. But as well, one of my favorite things in SAO is the world for Elphenhime which is in the second arc. This one is more of a setting akin to something you’d see out of Middle Earth in terms of fairies and monsters. The setting also calls for vast amounts of forest that surround the hub city which gives the feeling that’s it’s a city that’s hidden away in this massive VRMMO. 
Character designs are the second best thing about this series though, hands down. While I’m not going to go crazy over Kirito, as his is generic, I will let that slide. As every other character here is extremely well designed. Asuna Yuuki has a fantastic design which makes her look both intimidating and at the same time something to please the… fans if you get what I’m saying. But even the worst characters that aren’t Kirito like Suguha and Heathcliff look fantastic as well. You can tell A-- really wanted to make this anime the looking anime from that year. And honestly without a list off the top of my head of anime that came out that year, I am inclined to at the very least say it is indeed a very good looking anime. 
Animation 
Maybe not exactly the most well held of aspect, the animation at times can show its age. Being from the year ---- it’s populate with the random panning shot to save on budget, which to me is inexcusable. I absolutely hate panning shots for anime that’s not comedy. To me it’s just absolutely lazy to implement it when you’re A-- and have enough to fund -- episodes. And look what came out of this anime anyways, it’s a classic anime whether you hate it or not. It took the world by storm and has since made bucket loads of money, so the excuse they didn’t know it was going to be a success to me isn’t good enough. There is a reason there are people who forecast these sort of things in business. 
Continuing on the fight scenes in this anime are pretty well made, solid to say the least about them. The first major fight where we meet Asuna in the series is a good example how the worst the series can do, and that’s still a very good scene with lots of great action. The pacing for it is just incredible to see, they don’t really rush any fighting in this anime, and opt to let it build up and have a climax right at the time you’d want it to happen. Things flow naturally in terms of this in every other aspect I think as well. I could name a million nitpicks, but that would diminish the overall quality of this product, even with lazy panning shots. 
Score 
Now onto the reason most of you probably even give a damn about SAO, the score. And how do I put it, this score is freaking amazing. Probably in my Top -- anime scores of all time, right up there with Cowboy Bebop, DBZ, and Evangelion. The score here is done by Yuki Kajiura, and she breaths life into this world and story. Yuki has also done anime like; Princess Principal, .hack// Series, Fate Series, and Erased. Being very well known for her amazing scoring in anime, she continues to deliver with this series. The last battle in episode -- for SAO was an incredible scene because of her score, this whole series is basically carried by her score to at least something watchable. Scenes that on their own are either badly voice acted or just terribly written seem to be brought to life because of Yuki’s incredible score and her ability to seemingly sell any scene. Honestly there is nothing more to say on the score than that, at this point you should get out there on spotify and listen to it right now. Or on Youtuber or wherever you can listen to it. Hell, to me this is a score you should pay money to physically own on Vinyl. 
English Dub 
The English Dub… well it’s not good, but it ain’t bad either. It’s easily the most notable part of this show that didn’t age well. A lot of lines are stiff and have just awkward delivery. I’m not sure why this is, as this was a pretty decent cast with great voice actors. But somehow the dub here just fails to do anything for me, and for a majority of people. When I first watched this series though, I actually quite enjoyed what the dub offered, then again this was before I had gotten into anime fully like I am now. This was SeaTactics who was -- and before this maybe watched Attack on Titan, now I’m much more into the workings on things like these. Honestly though, this dub is still completely watchable, it’s not the worst, but it’s not something you should expect great quality from.

Prior to watching this series, the only exposure I had with fate was with the original FSN anime and the UBW movie by Deen. That is to say, they didn’t leave a good impression for me. After watching Fate/Zero however, I can say there aren’t many series quite like it. On the surface, it’s about mages that bring ancient heroes to the modern and fight against each other for the right to have a wish granted. However, the tale is deeply enthralling and excellently written and I would liken it to Shakespearean tragedies. To judge this series and any series by story alone doesn’t do them justice, for what makes a story truly great is the writing and narrative. All of this paired with high quality production. The production of the series is truly exceptional. At a glance, it presents cinema picture standards, fluid animation, great details and boasts great sound.  
Much of the series perspective is put into dialogues, and lots of it. A large portion of the dialogue in the beginning consists of explaining the world and rules of Fate. As we get further into the series, the dialogue becomes much more meaningful to building characters, understanding them and their relationships. It does much to the benefit of the series, but at the same time it can be a bit too excessive. There are pros and cons to this. In cases like Caster’s conversations with his master and Gilgamesh’s exchange of words with Kotomine Kirei, their dialogues build so much of their characters and relationships. On the other spectrum, there are points where there isn’t enough detail given from the dialogue but mostly they can be deduced from piecing things together. Whether or not it strikes a good balance, I will address it later in the review. 
What is truly remarkable about the series is that every detail in the writing counts. Every episode serves a purpose, every key character plays a role and every event results and leads to another from key decisions and set circumstances. In the beginning, we are presented brief introductions of each characters and have some idea of how they are like, but we truly begin to understand them as the series goes on.  
For the ancient heroes, their respective backstories are often told through imagery and play a key role to where they stand. While loosely referenced, if you have done readings on works like The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Arthurian legends, Alexander The Great, The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinneand, Joan of Arc, etc., they will further your understanding of the servant characters. Assassin is the only one who doesn’t receive much backstory because he doesn’t play much of a key role. And while Gilgamesh’s backstory remains a mystery throughout the series, his character’s interpretation is very likened to the actual Gilgamesh in the Epic prior to experience the loss of his friend Enkidu. If you have not read those works, I highly recommend them as fine pieces of literature and you will only enjoy these characters’ further. 
The masters that control their servants(heroes), all have unique qualities and personalities that are circumstantially matched with their servants. Kiritsugu and his servant Saber have an interesting dichotomy in characters, while both do have the intentions of “good” and a desire wish for something impossible. Waiver is a timid boy, brought down by the discrimination of half mages by pure-blood mages and that enters the war by chance upon finding out his pure-blood teacher Kayneth enters the war. Rider was supposed to be Kayneth’s servant but through chance, Waiver takes him instead and Kayneth is left with another servant. Through these circumstances, Waiver’s relationship with his servant allows him to develop as a character and Kayneth’s new servant conflicts with his own ideals and unintentionally charms his wife. Kariya, who has abandoned the life of mages enters in hopes of saving the child of the woman he loves and holds a personal vendetta against Tokiomi, the husband of said woman. Kotomine tries to find purpose in life and is recruited by his father to help Tokiomi win the war. Ryuunosuke is a serial killer who happens to be part of the war by chance, but is the only one of the characters I’d consider an “easy” villain. All of these characters including the servants and their perspectives/ideology are masterfully interwoven in this tale of tragedy. 
There are a few episodes that are somewhat diverted from the attention of the war, but they do serve a purpose. Rin’s episode furthers the perspectives of Tokiomi and Kariya, all the while experiencing the gruesome behaviors of Caster’s master. Kiritsugu’s past is an interesting part of the series and does an excellent job to further unravel the mysteries of his character, following from his actions taken to killing Kayneth, his wife and Lancer. Episode -- is my favorite episode of the series because of its powerful presentation of his tragic character. This further impacts the ending of the series as he eventually reaches the end of his farce. Episode -- also shows how well the series can present itself without heavily relying on dialogue. 
However, for a medium that’s exclusive to visual arts, I’d expect that storytelling in anime should make good use of visual imagery. That isn’t to say this series doesn’t have any. It certainly does contain strong and impactful imagery. The flashback scenes of ancient heroes and events that take place towards the end of the series are full of them. Personally I would prefer that it used it more from the beginning of the series as the dialogue endlessly explains so much, for better or worse. Does it extend to the point that it disrespects the intelligence of the viewer? That’s difficult to say, because I’m sure it was done with the intention of easing in the audience who is unfamiliar with Fate. Still, even though at times there is an excessive use of dialogue to explain things in great detail, it doesn’t do too much to disrespect the audience’s intelligence even though there are times when they explain too much.  Even so, I don’t consider this a flaw because it is just the series way of presenting itself. I may not agree with the presentation ---%, but it is still exceptionally executed. 
While Fate/Zero does help me appreciate the FSN story a bit more, which is the purpose of this prequel, in some ways it is being held back. I personally think the series can do well as a standalone but it’s by no means any less exceptional. The ending to Fate/Zero is an inevitable impactful tragedy and leaves a shining glimmer of hope. Ironically, that ray of hope does not necessarily include a well written sequel according to my prior experience of the Fate series.  
I don’t believe any work is “perfect” but Fate/Zero is no short of a masterpiece among anime. Very few have I seen boast such a well written and impactful tale and I recommend this series be watched many times over, because it is just that good.

""Kaguya-hime no Monogatari"" was such a beautiful movie made by Studio Ghibli and directed by Isao Takahata (of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" fame) based upon the famous Japanese folktale ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"". This is a movie that should truly be considered a ""work of art"". The classical Japanese art style, which left in sketch lines and seemed to be painted on, took a little getting used to but ended up being spectacular especially with the concluding moon parade sequence. Along with the music and singing, these elements were incredibly immersive and really helped to transport me back to --th century Japan. The portrayal of all the characters' emotions really stood out to me from the combination of the superb voice acting/singing and vibrant and dynamic art (definitely go with the original Japanese VAs). I could really feel all the pain, suffering and emotions that Kaguya was experiencing throughout the movie. It was just all around top notch work. 
The story itself was heart-wrenching (for me at least) and fueled by the emotions of Kaguya. Takahata definitely went with a more somber and emotionally distraught interpretation of this famous tale. As the viewer, you could really feel the love between Kaguya and her parents, but empathize with how they struggled to understand each other at times. At times, I felt so frustrated by Kaguya's father that I just wanted to slap the shit out of him even though he meant the best. I'm also a sucker for happy endings and I definitely got hit by the feels train at the end. That beautifully animated flying sequence when Kaguya and Sutemaru were finally reunited really had me going but then BOOM. And then came ""the ending"" (I don't want to spoil any of it so you'll just have to watch). I did feel that the story was a little hard to follow and unclear towards the end but this was when we were entering ""artistic license"" and ""rampant symbolism"" territory. It was pretty clear that Takahata wanted to leave some things open to the audience's own interpretation. 
All in all, an excellent watch and definitely Takahata's best work since Grave of the Fireflies. I recommend watching this with the original Japanese voice actors but the English dub didn't do a bad job either. I hope that Ghibli will continue to take on more eccentric projects like this in the future. I would have definitely loved this movie even more if it had ended on a happier note, but this is how ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" goes. You don't mess with a ----+ year old classic. Anyway, get out and watch this because you don't come across a piece of ""art"" like this too often.

To say &quot;simply the best&quot; would do Gurren-Lagann a disservice. It's so much better than that. This is an anime that had myself by the face for several months.  
The storywriting is great. There are a few holes in it, and it does fall into a few cliched tropes, but it pulls them off awesomely. The story's not particularly original, but it's done in such a way that it works so well. 
The art is simply astounding. From the excellent character designs to the unique and crisp mech designs, there's no real flaw in G-L's art of note. 
The sound is well done, as well. From the very fitting, dramatically done and professional voices, to the impactful sound effects to the amazing music (such as Shoko Nakagwa's opening theme, Sorairo Days), there's no way you won't like the music in this show. 
The characters are great, but you can see the effect of the whole mecha genre in it. You have the unconfidant kid, the powerful &quot;older brother&quot; character, the sexy girl, the moe girl, the cute pet, the political mind, and the rest of the army. However, the characters are all very fleshed out and work well. They're very - dimensional and don't fall into the same flat patheticness. 
The anime really shines in its enjoyability, however. The fights are well choreographed, the jokes are well timed, and the speeches are always full of hot-blood and awesome. 
If you're a mecha fan, you'd do yourself a great disservice by skipping this anime.

Hellsing has some strong points, but falls apart horribly in the second half. The first six episodes are interesting and put some thought into how being a vampire will affect the main character. The tone is appropriately dark. Father Anderson is my favourite character and his fight is one of the best ones. The music is an American hip hop style and is bizarrely an excellent fit. The art and animation quality are very low. Hellsing was made in the early ----s when studios hadn't figured out how to do digital animation well. The second half of this show is terrible apart from the music. It's anime original because the manga wasn't finished when this was made. I dislike the manga and this was a step down even from that. 
I enjoyed the style of Hellsing but the second half is atrocious and the visual quality is some of the lowest you will find in all anime dating back to the --s.

“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” - Aristotle.  
In Death Note's case, much, much greater.  
On the first day, Billy learned to ride his bike. On the second day, he learned to ride it with only one hand on the handle. On the third day, he could ride it without any hands. After that, riding without any hands is all he wanted to do. The thrill and excitement was overwhelming and he could not go back.  
Hailed as one of the best anime of all time, Death Note deserves to be on a list of ""Anime That Nostalgically Blind Us"". For many people, it's their first exposure to the wonder of anime or at least the first one to take them on a high-octane, wild ride. Just like Billy, many viewers become enthralled by Death Note because it showed them the joy of riding a bicycle with no hands. It's one of the most well-crafted anime in history, but like every show or movie, it isn't without its flaws. 
STORY - --/-- 
Death Note's plot is deceptively simple: ""The human whose name is written in this note shall die.""...and a genius highschooler happens upon this notebook and decides to take God's judgment into his own hands by killing off criminals. Throw in equally genius detectives, dozens of additional Death Note rules, and lots of dramatic flair and you have a bona fide cat-and-mouse game wrapped up in an engrossing psychological thriller.  
The writing is over-the-top but fits the adrenalized tone perfectly, aside from a few questionable lines (e.g. potato chips) that might have gone a bit overboard. Careful pacing from start to finish of each episode and melodramatic dialogue make for a rapidly accelerating rollercoaster. The latter half of the ride gets a bit bumpy with certain plot points, but the writing stays on point from beginning to end.  
Often times, people talk about how large a show's cast of characters is or how much death there is as if that alone serves to improve the story. As one might imagine, Death Note has quite a bit of death in it. The problem with death in stories is that it typically serves to create emotional turbulence within the viewer's heart, but it's very difficult to achieve this without taking the time to develop the character before killing him/her/it. The bulk of the journey, Death Note hits the spot, creating very interesting and volatile dynamics between characters. It falters towards the end by introducing far too many pivotal characters for one to digest so quickly. By the final episode, the show does pick up the pieces to construct a fairly satisfying conclusion, but perhaps not upon the same solid foundation it began with.  
VISUALS - --/-- 
From a technical standpoint, Death Note stood in the top tier of animation when it aired. In terms of the fluidity of things happening on screen (i.e. FPS), it's still better than many anime airing at the time of this review. To reiterate, not in terms of resolution since it isn't natively in ---p or ----p, but just talking about pure animation in the same way that Cowboy Bebop still trumps many modern anime in fluidity and detail. Studio Madhouse is well-known for their skill in creating very intense and suspenseful scenes through simple changes in camera angles and light distortion effects, both of which Death Note is a prime example of. Some people may criticize the liberal use of color filters and the tweaking of characters' hair and eye colors, but this was purposefully done to create the exuberant drama and suspense that are cornerstones of the show.  
SOUNDS - --/-- 
The soundtrack crackles and pops with the twists and tension of each episode. It knows when to come in loud and boisterous and when to simply flow along with a quiet or somber scene. There's a variety of electronic and orchestral tracks with multiple versions of many of them depending on the tone and pace at certain points in the show.  
It's hard to talk about the music without mentioning the voice acting that compliments it greatly. Everyone from the main to the supporting characters have been cast very well. In such a tumultuous and suddenly evolving anime, the voice actors succeed in expressing an array of emotions that produce meaningful, thought-provoking moments of silence in between all the dialogue. 
FINAL THOUGHTS: 
Here is an anime that takes a simple premise and expands upon it tenfold and in multiple dimensions of thought. Aside from the mind games it thrives on, it poses some real questions about morality and power. Complete with superbly consistent and fitting animation and a soundtrack that compliments it with its boldness and subtlety. One might almost be able to look past the few rushed and questionable plot points and lapses in characterization, but they must be taken into consideration. Certain parts of the show, namely the first half or so, do have a clearer sense of direction and tend to stand out more than the others, but it's important to weigh the entirety of the show on the same scale.   
TOTAL - --/-- 
NOTE: Point systems are far from perfect and shouldn't be taken at face value or compared between anime alone. To get the full picture, the review should be read since it contains the reasoning behind the score and that reasoning may not resonate with everyone.

There were two shows that I frequently found myself comparing and contrasting to Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou (Girls’ Last Tour) throughout my watch of it. They both aired this year, which is probably why they were fresh enough in my mind that I kept making these comparisons. These shows are Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss. All three of these shows have in common the theme of putting cute, sometimes naive characters in a gloomy setting that’s full of mystery. 
The level of gloom highly varies between these three shows. While Made in Abyss didn’t hold back from showing the dangers of its world and even depicted on-screen brutality at times, Kemono Friends kept its darker elements entirely as undertones, the show being overwhelmingly child-friendly. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou falls somewhere in the middle: Chito and Yuuri’s world clearly isn’t as innocent from the beginning as the one in Kemono Friends may appear to be, but it’s not overwhelmingly dark, nor is there much of a sense of threat or danger in most scenes. I’ve heard some refer to it as a “post-apocalyptic Aria”, which is definitely a good comparison. 
Our two main characters, Chito and Yuuri, are charming, cute girls with very contrasting personalities that the show likes to show off. Chito works as the true leader of their partnership, having the ability to read and write, while Yuuri is the seemingly fearless and naive “brawn” of the duo. (She’s not completely unaware or delusional about what’s going on but like Yuki in Gakkougurashi!, but simply always is able to look on the bright side.) There are some very interesting scenes in the series that suggest that perhaps Chito is envious of how naive, easygoing, and fearless Yuuri is. It reminds me of a quote from The Great Gatsby: “And I hope she’ll be a fool - that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” 
Thankfully, the show isn’t all gloomy. Much like Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou has some moments of slapstick and comedy that are sure to put a smile on your face and maybe make you forget for a second how bleak the world Chito and Yuuri live in is. 
The music is great. Every piece of music is set with the mood and the atmosphere in the scene in a similar way to Made in Abyss. Once you get past the dabbing in the OP, it’s a flawless catchy tune. 
However, the show isn’t perfect. My main issue with Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is the fact that most of the time, nothing’s happening. I sometimes struggled to recall significant events that had occurred in past episodes, simply because nothing seems that significant. You could probably sum up everything that happens in eleven out of the twelve episodes of the series over a single paragraph. Kemono Friends and Made in Abyss both kept my full attention by their sense of danger/threat and the way that the mystery was unveiled throughout these shows. At times, the show feels like something an English teacher would assign to you, along with questions to help you think about/understand the material. (Don't get me wrong; if it were a book you had to read in English class, it would be one of the better ones!) 
However, when the show decides it’s time to unwrap at least a portion of itself for the viewer, it makes the payoff of a slow-paced journey all that much better. Even still, some questions are left unanswered that leave plenty of room for a season -. My score was on a -/- borderline for the majority of the show, but I ultimately decided on an -. I loved Chito and Yuuri and would watch a season - in a heartbeat.

Book of Circus is a great series and is a great addition to the series as well as a good start point to newcomers. 
Actual Score: -.- 
Story: -- 
The story revolves around a piece of the manga plot missing from the main anime known the circus arc; which is a fun story made up of your favourite characters while also introducing some new ones as well as dark and interesting story as well as circling around some events from Ciel's backstory that add more depth which also helps fit newcomers in understanding the story better as well as serving as a recap for fans already. The story is well driven and has good pacing even though its only -- episodes long while also keeping up with an interesting story and the comedy fans know and love. 
Art: - 
The art is outstanding with well detailed characters and amazing set pieces that make the world come alive as well as well done fight scenes that will make your heart pound. 
Sound: - 
The opening of the anime is well done and fits the mood of the show with J-Rock band SID that set a dark atmosphere getting you ready for the show; while the ending was also well done it didn't have the same level as impact as the opening which made me neglect it fairly fast. The OST is amazing and helps portray the dark atmosphere the series portrays which is full of orchestral tones and folklore like music that fits nicely with the setting. 
Characters: - 
The characters that you know and love are back as well as some fresh faces that get a decent amount of backstory that opens that character more up as well as getting decent amounts of screen time. The most notable of the new cast was Joker ring leader of the circus who gets good screen time and has a unique personality that is refreshing as well as the other characters of the circus who all have interesting personalities and appearances.

I am catergorizing this review in - parts: evaluating the story, art, sound, characters, enjoyment, and finally providing my overall opinions. *I have only seen UBW, Zero, and Apoc; haven't played or seen any more of the fate world than those. 
First I want to make it clear that I do NOT HATE the Fate series; There is something alluring about a war taken place in the shadows, with seven magic-wielding individuals each summoning one of the many greatest heroes of all time. Fate/Apocryoha (Apoc) diverges from this formula slightly: a full-out war in a - vs - death match... and I guess - more ruler class servant who is completely unbaised. 
Well, having an out-in-the-open war is already diverging from the secretive atmosphere of the grail war formula- it ignores the dimension that these mages do not wish to interfere with the well-being of all of these muggles. And sure, this setup may also produce more fights between servants, but the weight and quality would severly take a toll with a lack of development. To me, the overall structure of Apoc seems like it sets itself up to make as much badass moments as possible, but I really don't see anything to attach to. And I would say that's slightly below average (-). In fact, I only finished this series so I can have enough credibility to provide my insight on this series. With the background story considered, I am going to consider the main story of Apoc- a campbell's journey for a homonculus Sieg. His arc is very, very bland and contrived as everything seems to happen just because it happens and I guess its cool-- but its not. Horrible (-). So overall, I would stamp Apoc's story department with a score of (-) as it is pretty stale and bland and is built to focus on badass moments (despite having zero weight).  
The next section is art. The background art is just still, and its just bad. Cheap tactics such as recycling the same-dull-bleak setting is just lazy and disgusting. Some may say that the dull-colored background supports the war atmosphere, but Fate/zero had a very strong war atmosphere with beautifully shaded backgrounds. (and note that Fate/Zero was made half a decade before Apoc and the former triumphs over the latter in every catergory). With the character designs... they are overall pretty shit. There are some good gems: Ruler, Saber of black, Rider of black, Caster of black, and Saber of red are good (I would give individually give ruler an - and saber of black a - and everyone else is between). But one of them is a carbon copy and nothing about any of their appearances reveal anything significant about their personalities.  Every other servant, (which was the highlight of every fate series before) is total garbage. WTF is Archer of Black, he has a freaking disgusting mane mullet. I would have given this category a -, but the art-style did allow for some movement (although sometimes bad can also be sometimes good), so I give art a (-) too. 
Sound is short and sweet. This whole show is sound. Everything is supposed to be cool because that one song pops up, the same song, and it ends up not being cool at all. There is absolutely nothing special about the score, in fact I think its very bad. All the openings and endings are good as individual songs, but they are just not a fit for the show and some of them are more fitting in other series. This match is crucial. But as much as I hate to (the openings and endings saved this catergory), I will have to give this category a (-).  
Characters make the show for me, for every show. And the Apoc characters suck. The main antagonist seems strangely lazy. Sieg has like a thousand Deus ex Machinas up in his ass. All of the characters have very generic ideologies and their grit never translated to me (something Emiya actually managed to do to me). Don't expect to see character development either, love intrests just happen I guess. And every servant is just too mood-swingy, like for plot. These are the worst characters I have ever met, and I will never ever want to see them again... (-). 
I don't know if anyone can tell, but I absolutely did not enjoy Apoc. Immediately, (-). I plagued through this show, and I do not recommend this to anyone unless you don't really care about depth and want to be blinded by the fate lore (which is okay, its your time). 
Overall, Apoc is the shittest action show you will ever see and an even shittier character story. You will get some reward by viewing two or three of the best character designs and listening to the openings and endings, but that's the extent of your enjoyment, and even then they are not the best use of your time. Fate fans, you would spend your time better if you were (re)watching Zero or UBW: Zero for a real War with real ideologies and UBW for a real War with real fanservice. 
I give Apoc a score of (-), urging anyone to skip this series.

This is my first review so please don't be to harsh on me. 
I became a fan of this series only a couple of years ago because in the US this anime and manga series is ignored probably because of a poorly done dubbing back in the early ----'s.  
The plot involves a group of orphan boys serve the Greek Goddess Athena and they fight with armor that is based on constellations called Cloths and they battle enemies that are in the Sanctuary and they battle other greek gods as well.  
What I like about this series is that the cloth designs are really cool and creative and I like the character designs as well. 
What I don't like is that the characters need more development, most of the time they are serious but there is some comical scenes and I wish that the anime stuck more to the manga, because there is a lot of episodes that are fillers.  
Overall I think it is a good series the fights are good and plus if you are a girl like me that likes Bishounen there is a ton of characters that are like that in this series. Also this series is considered a classic it may not be popular in the US but on other parts of the globe it is.

I've never written a review before but I just had to write a review for this one.  If I can save one person from the misery of sitting through this tripe then I'll have done my duty as a human being.  I've forgotten the names of the male and female lead but it doesn't matter.  As this review focusses solely on them, the words ""he"" and ""she"" should cover it.   
So here it is: The idea of a romantic comedy is to make the viewer/reader root for the couple in the spotlight; to cheer them on in their quest to find true love while at the same time, giving us a good laugh in the process.  Itazura na Kiss does none of this.  Unless you find a girl's miserable existence, trapped in a one-sided relationship with a bully, great comedy material, you will not enjoy this. 
The female lead in this show is a salavating halfwit and the male lead is an egotistical misogynist.  For some reason, despite the fact this simply horrible man treats her like something most of us would avoid stepping in, however, she adores him.  The show covers nine years by my recollection and this never changes once.  She remains smitten by someone who clearly has no respect for her whatsoever and he never stops being a hateful scumbug. 
As the show goes on, you find yourself rooting for the male lead to die.  Not just to lose her love, but to be killed in a horrible accident.  Alas this doesn't happen.  If it had, this alleged comedy might finally have given us something to laugh about, but alas he does not. 
Without saying too much and spoiling anything, the show follows their romance from high school up until they're in the late twenties.  They get married and eventually have a child together, then finally our hell is at an end because they stopped making this rubbish.  During those years covered, the male lead sneers at and looks down on his dimwitted other half constantly.  He gets nastier and nastier by the minute then every now and again he'll say something like, ""You may look like a mutant from the planet uggo but you're not the least prettiest moron I've ever shagged.""  At which point, she will go starry eyed and drool, taking his words as a compliment.  The real insult there being that as the viewer, we're supposed to find his back-handed compliments endearing too.  We don't.  They just make us want to drown him.   
Finally, just to hammer home the point of what a nasty show this is.  At one point the female lead actually stands up for herself and screams at him, ""You don't love me.""  Finally, I thought.  It's about time she stood up for herself.  Sadly no.  He hits her!  Yes, he resorts to domestic violence.  To make matters worse, she then finds herself feeling guilty and blames herself for putting too much pressure on him.  Oh yes, he whacks her and she apologises.  I kid you not!  If this was a subjective look into the mind of a battered woman, I'd say give them an Oscar.  However, it is not.  This is apparently a comedy.  Maybe if you hate women you might find this quite the turn on or indeed worthy of a chuckle, for decent human beings, however, this anime is quite frankly wrong.

This first episode is basicly a three minute show about stupidity. Yeah, some tits were rubbed, some G-Point implied, japanese sayings were torned by ecchi perversion, but that's not what matters. What really matters here is the mental diarrheia this represents, and the effect a special episode can have on it's younger audiences. These - minutes were enough to show a complete lack of taste, humour and professionalism by the producers, who seem to enjoy objectifying women. I consider myself a pretty nasty guy, but I keep nasty were it should be: in the porn industry. If they really want to make this kind of thing, why don't they leap the final frontier and go hentai? It would be better than releasing this ecchi-shounen kind of specials...

If you like smut then you'll like this show. It's not an ecchi show, this is basically hentai, I watched it on a hentai site. It's actual genre is TL (Teens' Love) and its target audience is women. I enjoyed it very much especially the main antagonist Myojin Aki. The show served it's purpose with the smut and for a series that compiles into an hour of content it wasn't so bad. It got me into TL and now I actively look for more. Look it got me off, that's all I was gonna get from it. Pretty 'meh' story but I wasn't watching for a story so whatever. If there's a hentai or anything out there with a --/-- on everything, please lead the way.

So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on ---% excess and shock-factoring like Elfen Lied. 
Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In ---- a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something. 
As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a toss away filler arc, that repeats its self until something finally happens after - episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it, and when it finally does it's a very clich&eacute;d horror blunder trick comprised of a very cheesy sound effect that sounds like they are crushing tomatoes, and a cheesy cut out that either goes red or black.   
This series seriously lacks suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.  
And then the story continues again and starts out the same, we're in the school house, they act like we don't know any of the character by now, and then some annoying detective shows up again to go over the SAME mystery we heard - episodes ago!  How many times do I have to be told the little girl's parents were ran out of the village because of a damming project and that the brother's bat has gone missing.   I feel like I'm watching Pokemon, with the same thing different day style it's done over the last -- years.   
The series can work up it's suspense and chill level especially with the chirping cicadas that provide an almost melodic atmosphere, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not?  Even when in my jumping through episodes and reading further spoilers, I find the series doesn't go anywhere else, it's a bad version of Ground Hog Day with out the comedy, and the Blair Which Project, with out the suspense.  
Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller.  The only time I have seen it work, was Madlax. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again.   
But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/-w-tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it. 
I can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for the general suspense lovers (Like me) who want suspense and less gore, you may want to avoid this one.  
Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.  The only thing decent about this show was the  opening theme.  The sound effects sound cheesy and really childish.  Higurashi is basically a suspenseful melodrama with out the suspense.

Ou, I was a teenager when I started to watch and be a fan of this anime. We were a group of fans which imagined that we are SailorMoon or SailorMars and so. We watched these episodes and cried with characters etc. That was real fun. 
Now I think this is one of the precious animes I have ever seen because it is funny un childish in its sort kind of way, it is romantic and a little bit nude but isn't too pervert to show to children, it shows different kind of situations that could happen in real life too (mostly metaphorical of course) and it shows that bravery and good friends are most valuable think in world. 
It is good anime because of these situations which teaches us to be brave and never give up. At least from this anime I learned that and now I never give up and continuing to be brave when it is needed.

The only thing I really liked about this anime was the whole Gods and Demons on Earth aspect. Besides that, this anime was kinda terrible. They invest so much time in characters, but most of them have the same kind of story and you don't feel any kind of attachment to any characters. Rin ends up with the most randomest person and the last - episodes completely sucked and took a turn for something lame and tragic. 
I don't really recommend this anime unless you're bored and have nothing else to watch.

Dear god, what the hell did I just watch? Part of me was sickened and part of me kept watching. Honestly, I ran into this one with little to no notice as to what I was getting myself into, and it's going to take awhile to get this series out of my head which is what I believe they wanted to do. Will not post any spoilers, but be forewarned from this point, this isn't for the timid or weak. Nudity and gore is one thing, but child abuse is another.

i Gotta say this anime changed the meaning of Anime. 
I was trying to find a good anime to spend time on watching and somehow i came to this one after watching the first - episodes i was dying of laughter, it was so funny likewise enjoyable. 
Either you like it or not , just give it a try i guarantee it , you will have astonishing moments watching this Anime. 
I found the characters very amusing the Demon Lord i mean DEMOND LORD and his servant coming to the Human without any magic and working in a fast food restaurant? doesnt seem very cool to me but it was hilarious to watch and the one who beat the Demond forced him to come to the Human world a Hero girl following the Demond lord in order to kill him but nothing goes as planned. 
Watch this enjoyable yet fantastic Anime with supreme Comedy scenes and more.

Killing bites is a fighting anime, the story centers around a tournament called the Destroyal. In this tournament he have four teams of three, each person on each team has a sponsor. The job of the sponsor is both in financial backing, and the ability to move their fighter like a chess piece on the tournament grounds. This story is one that follows Hitomi, the main fighter, and Nomoto her hostage / sponsor. The over all fights are okay, but the show does rely a lot on fan service to survive.  
It's a little hard to go into much on what happens, but that can be common in a fighting anime. I think this show misses in one of the larger points though, that point being. Why am I caring? Hitomi is a strong fighter, but she basically is someone who will do anything that Shidou will tell her to do. Shidou is pretty much the figure in the dark who is masterminding the whole deal. Then we have Nomo, who as stated before, is basically their hostage. He met Hitomi in a gang rape gone wrong. He was spineless driver in the whole thing, but yea. Now under the threat of death he is the sponsor for Hitomi, using money given to him by Shidou which he must not use or else. He's of course totally fine with this since Hitomi is really cute. 
I would have liked more interactions, to show them forming some sort of bond, but the show wastes no time in jumping into the bulk of the fighting. I understand, since we have -- episodes and the tournament itself is pretty big. This might be a case of a show needing a full -- to really flesh everything out. Of course if that did happen I'd be subjected to another -- episodes of someone (Usually Hitomi) Pointing out that ""The one with the sharpest fangs win. That's what killing bites is."" In literally every episode apart from number -- that exact quote, word for word is said at least once. Which means in a couple of them, we get it another time. That for me was a huge problem. Can you imagine the writers of the show needing to come up with a reason for someone to give that exact tagline every episode? It hurts me. 
Taste: I mean, it didn't taste bad. The forced tagline leaves a bitter after taste but the fights were okay. I feel like the latest meta in fighting anime is to just have someone have overwhelming power. It kills the tension in a lot of fights I think. I wouldn't say the show is one note, it's more like it's lacking ingredients. We have a nice steak of characters that needed a little more seasoning. We have a world that's been built, but needs a good sauce. We have some side dish characters, but they just kinda got added onto the plate. I'll give it a - out of -- 
Presentation:  The art isn't lazy. The characters are reasonably done. Nothing sticks out as far as the music goes. As for the fan service. I think there are two ways of doing something like that in a anime. In one way. It just happens to be there. Like. Oh we just happen to have something tear just right, and in these cases I don't think it takes away from a show in general. The other way is of course how Killing Bites goes which is basically just having someone's ass hang out. There are shows that do it worse! But in this case it brings it down a little. For example in one fight we have a person with the ability to release pheromones, so we have Hitomi and Eruza basically take a break to get their freak on. Neither fighter is really punished for this, which might be the only reason why such an ability would be handy in a fighting tournament, but instead everyone just kinda takes a break to you know.. Watch.. Presentation gets a - out of - 
Originality: I mean, what we're getting is a fighting anime, with its core being a tournament. So in this what you really want to look at is how they get there, and the decided curveballs in how the tournament is presented. It all basically jumps into the tournament, but I think how it's presented is nifty. First the characters are all animal hybrids. So they have neat animal powers in a way. Eruza is a cheetah, so she's very fast. We have Inaba who is a bunny, so she has great hearing. And so forth. Next the sponsor idea is nifty in that there's a strategy in how characters are moved around. I think the idea was great, but they missed a little on the execution. But I'll give a - out of - on this one. 
In conclusion killing bites is a fan service-y fighting anime. There's certainly a lot more too the story that is not gotten into, so it probably needs another season or two. If it'll get those? I can't really say. Might have to pick up the manga.  But this show gets a -- out of --.

If you've seen Blood+ and the Blood movie, this will be a letdown for you. 
One of the predominant aspects of the Blood saga is the character design and individuality of the characters. 
Aspiring to be a total mindfuck and actually achieving it (many that try lose direction and fail hard) played a big part of the original series and the plot unfolded with a carefully crafted direction. 
.....time travel to ---- and the batshit annorexic artists from CLAMP get to starting a ""remake"", turning the brooding vampiress Saya into a clumsy happy go lucky halfwit who plays a good hand in destroying the girls with glasses = kawaii fanclub in the process. 
Combining all of the above with Characters designs that are overused and reminiscent of late --'s anime (without the heavy use of shading however) and you get a series that if you've seen the original will probably end up finding yourselves moving it from plan to watch to dropped in the first - minutes of watching..... 
Some Reimaginings should be kept as just that, and not played out in an actual remake.

It makes me fear about the future of the world after seeming a score more than a - on this show. This show is a sequel, which indicated that people actually enjoyed the first season. Now, I understand that this is fictional media and nothing like this would probably happen in real life, but at least Oreimo tried to create a story. This show literally didn't even try and attempted to operate itself as a gag manga with ecchi elements. If that was it's goal, it did the job decently well; however, if you view this show without a teenager's mind and thought about it from a moral standpoint, this show is horrendously bad. I'm not even considering incest, which I literally don't care about since it's anime and things happen. It's about the ways that the scenes that normal ways that gave teenage virgins, it's targeted audience, an erection that bothers me. While some shows like To Love RU expresses it as a gag, this show just literally make all the women always horny. There is nothing special about this except being the ""double twin incest anime"" with the crappy and cliché situations that the main character ends up in most the time. Unfortunately, I wished I could say that this show has something special, but all they have are bananas. They always have the bananas, it's the universal ecchi fruit, it's time to invent a new fruit America!

Space Dandy consists of -- episodes though, leaves you wanting more, not because the ending is unsatisfying, but because it is so good. At first glance this anime may seem odd and nonsensical (which it is) but it is more than that. It is almost impossible to describe and must be seen to really understand and appreciate. 
The art style is colorful and flowing. It's energetic and not like any other style I have ever seen in anime. 
Lots of upbeat jazz keeps the mood light and energetic. there is a variety of other music as well. 
The three main characters Dandy, QT and Meow are lovable, dumb and enjoyable to watch run around being ridiculous. There is a multitude of other characters who are equally as lovable. The amount of characters and the amount of soul in each makes it impossible to chose a favorite. 
Space Dandy is an absolute joy to watch and is one of my personal favorites.

I'll be fair. I had quite the high expectations for this anime. Not only from what I've heard about it, but from what I saw on the trailer and first episode. 
It starts with an interesting concept. It's not an uncommon one, but it seemed to be well-executed. That, and the great art-style and animation, including Re-L's character design made me want to continue watching. I was starting to get hyped, since I haven't felt this need to continue watching something so badly for a long time. 
Third episode comes. The opening is really interesting, and got a feeling out of me. A character who seemed to be a supporting role starts to become more important. 
Then, slowly and without realising it so quickly, the animation begins to become... inconsistent. Their faces become distorted at times, and then they look really gorgeous. But even with this unstable art, it manages to be great as a whole. The opening doesn't evoke the same feelings as it did before. 
The characters seem to do the same things, or have the same behaviour. Where's the character development? Not to be found. Yeah, there are some episodes dedicated to the acceptance of their identity, yet it seems they don't really change that much with their revelations. It tries to be smart and it kinda achieves it, yet it goes nowhere with it. 
Was it a letdown? Yeah. Is it a bad anime? Eh. Not really. It's just not what it's hyped up to be. I was expecting a deep, heavy anime, so perhaps that was my mistake.

I had extremely high expectations of this series going in. It's got a great rating and it is highly regarded by many anime enthusiasts. Having just watched Kill la Kill and being extremely entertained for most of it, I was expecting Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to show me more of what I loved: a blitzkrieg of absurdist comedy and stylish characters. It does pretty well for a while, with successful comedy and characters and big, beautiful action. But after some time it sort of... takes a dive and loses a chunk of what made it special. 
I think TTGL is a fine show. It's just a show that also happens to suffer in plot and characters pretty irredeemably. Half of the show is about plot and drama, so this is a pretty serious issue. Regardless, the art is great, the spectacle is fantastic, and there are plenty of feel-good moments.

The story is a just a classic coming-of-age story, which of course there is nothing inherently wrong with. There's also tons of commentary on the power of the instinctual improvement, determination & emotion, and being human. I was hoping that this might be a point that inspires me to actually do something with my life, but the plot only gets less convincing as it goes on. It is structured as a plot that constantly tries to one-up itself, where they are brought to the brink of despair but somehow pull it out by being cool. That isn't something I mind, and it provides some pretty good forward momentum, but the show even acknowledges that this is how it's going to go, so the 'tension' isn't really there. It's not bad, but the characters can't always carry the plot so well, especially near the end where the audience can predict the ebb and flow of events. The characters that carry the ebb and flow of events get gradually worse. 
[Art: --] 
Great style, amazing spectacle in action scenes, gorgeous color palettes, willing to experiment with artistic styles, strong use of light, often good shot composition, strong character design. 
Sometimes animation gets a little lazy when characters are far from the scene, but happens infrequently. 
Let's just... Not talk about episode -. For anyone who didn't know, they put a different animation team on  E- with intention of rotating teams over the course of the series. E- got such a negative reaction that they were canned immediately. What an eyesore, jesus.  
[Sound: -] 
Nothing to see here. Totally decent sound work. Doesn't really do much wrong, but doesn't do a whole lot to enhance the work. Doesn't really go either way. 
[Character: -] 
The character cast is big. That is something that the show succeeds at. Many of the throwaway characters are have funny little quirks that the audience is always happy to see. Some characters that aren't main characters turn out to be awesome later on in the story, like Kittan and Rossiu. The roster has awesome breadth. However, the depth of the main characters is the biggest issue. 
Alright, you've got Kamina. Kamina is the man of men and is a great character, should be no surprise.  
You've got Simon. Simon is... In the first arc his development is satisfying and his interactions with Yoko and Kamina feel totally on point. In the second arc he's just a 'let's do it!' machine, which is pretty uninteresting. Especially because his main motivation in the story is based on his relationship with Nia... and Nia is such a shitty character, but we'll get to that. 
You've got Yoko. Jesus Christ they completely sidelined this character. She had great potential due to her place in the first arc. She feels like a compass and an anchor for Simon, something that would say ""I want you to do the best you can and belong in this weird world, but I also want you to be more like Kamina"". She balances and frames Simon and Kamina pretty damn well. Then in the second arc she is just a girl with a gun and fan-service, with no real impact on any of the characters. She becomes equal to all the other throwaways. I would've liked to see Simon and Yoko develop their relationship more, in whatever capacity.  
Then we have Nia... Nia is a big part of the second arc. Nia sucks. Outside of her visual design, she is just a girl who talks softly and strangely, doesn't know much about the world, and believes in Simon. That's it. She yet she is a focal point of the plot since she is strongly tied to the events in the second arc and has a strong relationship with Simon. This is the kind of thing that not only bogs down the story but also cripples Simon's character. Why should he care so much about this loser? Is there something wrong with him?  
I also just don't understand the point of having Viral in the story. He is more prominent than the other backgrounders, but never really does anything... nor does audience ever believe that he will do anything. My guess is he serves as a sort of measuring stick for how Simon does at fitting Kamina's image, but there are other ways of doing that with the rest of the cast (like by using Yoko). 
[Enjoyment: -] 
The art alone makes the action fun to watch. It isn't well-choreographed or anything, but the sheer execution of the spectacle of it all is definitely satisfying. Hell, despite the obvious oscillating nature of the plot, the spectacle had me pretty excited and eager to see what was next. 
Several great character moments, though moreso in the first arc. 
I'll say that one of my favorite parts of the series, in the beginning, was the creativity that Kamina and Simon had in dealing with their opponents. It feels more like a comedy/parody of the mech genre, the kind of visual comedy I loved seeing in Kill la Kill. However, as the series continues, this sort of stuff gets replaced by boring, predictable drills and a lot of the comedy is lost. 
[Overall: -] 
Story and Characters take a big dive in the second act. This doesn't completely kill the series by any means since the action is still beautiful and there is a decent amount of forward momentum, but many of the main characters just don't really offer anything by the end of it. I still had a good time watching and would recommend it to anybody who is into this kind of stuff. Maybe I'll be able to look back on it for advice in growing up.

One dimensional cardboard characters, plain bad looking art style and jokes that aren't funny in any way, there's the essence Asobi Asobase. The comedy is mostly build around either characters doing or saying something completely random and unexpected or character having a weird over the top facial expression. After seeing first -- minutes I had already seen all this show had to offer. I still went and watched every episode trying to confirm there weren't any good jokes in the show, there were not. Confirming this wasted about - hours of my time though, so I guess joke's on me.  
A good situational comedy would have build ups leading to a punchline, Asobi Asobase doesn't. Just constantly spewing bad memes one after another isn't what I could call funny or entertaining. Characters themselves are so simple and bad it would admittedly be hard to do anything more verbal that that with a cast like this.   
This show really gave me nothing, except an huge overload of obnoxiousness. Nichijou does everything this show tries to do on a whole another level.

Starts off  strong, but does not pay off in the end. If I had to summarized this show in a few words: it's like if an - year old told on another - year old to the teacher that he pooped in the corner. The teacher, instead of verifying by getting up to check the evidence, punishes the accuser. Aaaand repeat with the narc doing it again and again. Except in the end, there's no friggin pay off as the consequences of each characters are so minuscule, it's as if nothing ever happens. The main character is about the only one with half a brain, but even he is barely tolerable. The rest of the heroes may as well not exist. In fact, -/- of the way through a character finally shows up and basically like...the whole entire plot could've been avoided if that character had just done their job from the beginning. The rest of the casts are borderline retarded, like clinically speaking- they are dumb as shit. Watching this anime I was screaming at how dumb each characters actions were because it just made no friggin sense. Quit - episodes short of the season finale and I'm not going to finish it because it's a waste of time. 
If you can turn off your brain and like to watch pretty things happen, then you may actually enjoy this anime a little.

I've was patient with this series. I really was. But after everything, the show still didn't have a clear plot or direction. It didn't even have an atmosphere, something that the equally poorly paced God Eater (also produced by ufotable) at least had.  
What pisses me off the most is that the rules of this world seem to be written by a six year old: ""So there's these ruins, and then there's this hero who can see spirits but only he can, and then there's this princess who really likes him. And then he goes off to kill dragons and stuff."" There's not much behind the motivations of the characters. None of them even have much character outside of the trope slots that they occupy. The most interesting thing about them is their appearance, for which there is no rhyme or reason.  
All throughout, I was waiting for the plot to truly open up. I was bored out of my mind to the point of anger, and in the end I got nothing for my troubles.

Out of all of the anime's I've ever seen, Eiken probably takes the spot in  
the top -- worst anime's I've ever seen. The show only runs for about two  
episodes, but I'm not sure if it's because the creator's planned it that way,  
or simply because it sucked.  
The story is poor because I'm not even sure  
what's going on half of the time. The art and sound I guess is good, but  
that's like the only decent part about it. The character development is mediocre at best. The main character is bland, boring and not all that interesting and all the other girls don't have anything special about, literally there's nothing special or unique about any of the girls considering that most of them have boobs the size cannon balls.  
Now me personally don't mind fanservice that much, in fact I downright enjoy the fanservice of a show with a passion, but this show takes it too far. They literally give a girl in the -th grade, that looks no older than my eleven year old sister boobs the size of freaking Hitomi Tanaka (For those who don't know who Hitomi Tanaka is, she is a Japanese pornstar with size -- J natural breasts). Basically, the only thing this show is successful at is getting the male viewers somewhat excited. Hope this review was helpful.

This is an anime that has obviously been rushed, one of which has one of the best stories and background lore to its title adding many themes and ideas such as racism, what it means to be human as well as the meaning of life and the causalities in war. The makers have tried really hard to finish it as quick as they can and that can obviously be seen through the dullness in the characters and how really there aren't any tear jerking scenes AT all in a genre such as this. But mainly what I am trying to say is as far as this anime goes in its -- episodes, it failed because they could HAVE done much better and much more. It mainly felt like 'oh, this person died, what do we do now, whatever, get over it, fight seen and back to trying to be emotional all in one episode'. My final verdict is a - at my sincere disappointment in how they screwed up one of the best stories that could have been made.

Rating -/-- (if I could) 
This is undeniably the worst anime I've ever had the misfortune to watch. It was agonising going through this show.  
The story has no depth, and thus requires no in depth analysis. This absence is desperately concealed by the gimmick of gore/sex- there is nothing else going for it.  Most of the series is episodic; the characters and plot are inconsistent to the point of lacking a modicum of realism, to the point of absurdity.  
Story : -/-- 
Demons. They're bad. Kill them. They like sex. Alot of nudity. Drama happens that should influence plot but is forgotten about. Demons like to party at night for sex and massacre the group present - done so without anyone knowing, even though there are hundreds of people present. -- episodes yet somehow quite episodic. Humans lack mental faculties to the point of running around with rocks and pitchforks just killing cats and cutting heads off for dramatic effect because of the fear of almighty demons (anyone see the dubious rationale behind this?). Girls love MC and masturbate to him after getting raped and make animal noises. Expect cheesy death scenes. Lots of sex. The 'twists', or I should actually just say twist, is just about the most cheesy, predictable and badly choreographed 'revelation' I've had to witness. It was just the function of another desperate shock factor to make up for the lack of substance throughout. It's like the author said, ''heres just one more thing we can do to make this more shocking''.  
As you see, I'm just listing pretty much what you can expect to see - because most of this crude anime is just the sum of independent, nonsensical events like this.  
Characters -/-- 
They are inconsistent - not sticking to  their core character. They shift between being demonic to humanising them on a whim when it benefits the show. You will likely get thoroughly frustrated with the characters, as they shift in behaviour, or are so naive that you will be smacking your head throughout. MC's best friend is an incredibly cliche character that seems to excel at everything. Side characters are forgettable. All the demons seem to love running track - its a big focus. Even after their transcendence, it's the only thing on their minds. Not much beyond this. So don't expect much relation to the characters. MC himself had potential, but terribly squandered and ultimately cheesy. He is so naive that it's painful.  
Art -/-- 
Now I understand the art can employ varying qualities as a medium for the atmosphere to complement the core concept. But in this case, it simply looks cheap. It is so bad you will have no idea what is going on in the combat scenes. The combat just looks like picture slides from a ----s karate cartoon.  
Sound : -/-- 
It seemed so dull at first because of the distasteful anime content. But I reviewed it again, and honestly, it isn't bad.  
Enjoyment : -/-- 
I offered this generous rating because the gore and sex was to some extent audacious. However, from an objective standpoint, most would be put off by it.

A famous idiom is, ""To kill two birds with one stone."" 
But with Haruchika, it's more like ""To miss two birds with -- stones."" 
Haruchika revolves around two main characters (in case you haven't guessed from the title, their names are nonetheless Haruta and Chika), that are part of the Brass Band Club. Not only are Haruta and Chika trying to do their best for this club, and thus, attempting to get more members, they are also solving mysteries going around the school that, very conveniently, involve introducing new characters that play an instrument (and with every solved mystery, it often results in gaining a new member for the band club). While this seems like Haruchika is technically killing two birds with one stone, in the actual execution of it, it is anything but that. 
Also, on a side note, I'd like to point out that I did not mention Haruchika as having romance (unless you count a silly crush), and, despite the perfectly sounding ship name of ""Haruchika"", if you are planning to watch this solely because it seems like a romance of the two main characters, don't bother as you will soon realize why in the first episode. Anyways, continuing on: 
As said before, there is no effort to include the music genre, and instead, it is used as this loophole that gives the anime reason to lack depth in the mysteries; each mystery revolves around a problem of a person, and this person happens to be affiliated with a musical instrument, so the end result of obtaining said person to be in the band is more important than the actual mystery. But despite all that, the band rarely performs in the anime. The mysteries don't make up for this lack of music, either. 
The mysteries themselves are simplistic, which is why they can be solved in the time span of one episode, even less with the amount of flashbacks they have to try to get you to care about the new character. It's with this lack of time that should raise alarms to how the ""detectives"", in this case, Haruta and Chika (though it's really just Haruta), analyze the clues and ultimately, solve the mystery. 
Answer: He doesn't. 
Haruta doesn't really investigate. He listens, is confused enough so that we have to wait about - minutes for him to figure out. In that - minutes he listens to the flashback of someone, and after the flashback is up, all of a sudden he has all the answers to the mysteries with about - clues to back his reasoning up even though the most clues he actually investigated amounts to one. 
Chika baffles me even more. She's so useless in the mystery portion; the most she has contributed to the solving of a mystery is her lightheartedness and cheerfulness. 
That's pretty much all the characters are: Haruta is the detective, Chika is the motivator, and everyone else is either someone that plays an instrument or someone that will help with the club. That's it. The characters are all one-noted, with none of them shown to have any other dimension. 
Continuing on with the characters, their designs weren't as well thought out as I have seen them do with some of their other series. For me, one of my main problems were the eyes that try to go for mesmerizing but fail and turns out to be muddled, childish, and off-putting, all of which can equally describe the series as a whole.

I must be to old to like this anime. 
There is no story, it`s all about - young students who are afraid to show their real feelings. 
And then it`s only short stories, - or - in - episode. 
It`s really boring, Chika is somewhat amusing although not really. 
Maybe if the characters would evolve, but they don`t. 
The main characters are showing bold and all knowing, but they are really as insecure as a little schoolgirl 
Maybe i have seen to many of this genre, but it just doesn`t interest me at all. 
Watch this if you like to see insecure students bumbling around, otherwise don`t waste your time on this 
perhaps the manga is beter, but i don`t like reading from right to left so i`ll never know

Three years after the conclusion of Cowboy Bebop, we return once more to the futuristic world of Spike Spiegel and his fellow bounty hunters to solve one last bounty, one that boasts the highest stakes of them all. Tengoku no Tobira challenges the conventions of an ""anime film"" by serving as a proper, standalone addition to a well-renowned, richly developed universe.  
Story (read the synopsis first!) 
While the story initially starts off like just another bounty, there's a certain amount of character to this movie that sets it apart from the original series. For one, its involves a darker, more sinister tone that juxtaposes itself to Cowboy Bebop with a stark contrast of attitude. Further, while most of the previous bounties focused on isolated antagonists, Tengoku no Tobira concerns itself with a primary antagonist in Vincent Volaju, one quality enough to rival even Vicious. 
The story progresses at a smooth rate, though some viewers may find themselves uncomfortable with the length of the film. There are several scenes that are silent and drawn out, such as Spike's wandering around Mars, with others very sedentary and dialogue-heavy, such as various back-and-forths between Spike and Jet. Personally, I enjoy both of these types of scenes, as well as longer film lengths, so I didn't find it much of an issue. Just sit back and enjoy 'em! 
Art 
Man, wouldn't it have been great if this is the animation we had from the start? Considering its age, Cowboy Bebop expressed  respectable animation, yet Tengoku no Tobira kicks everything up a notch by featuring considerably fluent, colorful, and realistic animation for our viewing pleasure. The atmosphere of a scene is never in question and properly made to represent a the intended tone of a scene. Certain combat scenes were considerably inventive for their time, showcasing the technical prowess of each of the three studios involved in the animation. 
Sound 
Nothing surprising here. The soundtrack of the film was quite amazing. Yoko Kanno returns as the music director as certainly does not disappoint by bringing the same stylized vibe that enlivened the main series to Tengoku no Tobira. Certain tracks also assume the locale in which it is played, notably the Arabic district Spike visits at points in the film, enriching the cultural value of the soundtrack as well. 
Character 
None of the characters from the main series particularly change their attitudes or personalities in this film. I think retaining a certain sense of familiarity was the better route, as the story was meant more to focus on the newly presented characters and not so much any character development from the original cast. That being said, it's always fun to hang out with the Bebop crew again, and there's enough screen-time for each of them to please any fan. 
While there are a handful of supporting characters, the two new additions worth mentioning are antagonist Vincent Volaju and deuteragonist Electra Ovilo. 
Vincent redefines what it means to be cryptic and menacing, inciting some particularly intriguing dialogues on the concepts of both sanity and morality. Whereas Vicious' antagonism towards Spike was more one of relation, Vincent's was one of ideology, yet no less intense.  
Electra served more of a supporting role in the film, though her relationship with Vincent and Spike led to some interesting dynamics that did well to increase the value of the plot. Those who enjoy strong, independent female characters will enjoy Electra. 
Enjoyment 
It's hard not to enjoy anything remotely Cowboy Bebop related. Watanabe and the crew could have put me in front of a two-hour dialogue between Spike and Jet on the merits of bonsai and I'd have gotten a kick out of it. Tengoku no Tobira, however, sets it apart from your typical anime film in that its very standalone in terms of its depth and relevancy compared to the main series. It's not a simple time waster presented to fans of the original series to bait their wallets, rather we as consumers complete the film with a sense of appreciation and admiration. Simply put, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will like Tengoku no Tobira. 
Be sure to look out for the butterflies. They're quite beautiful.

Back in the day, it was either Bleach or Death Note that every emo or goth kid had to get a poster of to fill their bedroom walls as they'd lie in bed blasting Underoath on their -----song iPods all day. Yes, I do mean the '-- scene that no one wishes to talk about; nevertheless, it brings back some memories when Orange's Asterisk comes up in the recommended vids section on YouTube. Kubo as a mangaka was the kind of artist that got inspiration from the music he listened to while laboriously illustrating a ---page chapter each week in his studio. It's funny to think sometimes how a lot of those popular anime series back then were inspired from the fashion of that metal scene for the construction of it's characters. The emo-goth phenomenon was taking over mainstream anime at one point just as it did in our high schools. 
This is not intended to bring back dark memories of the past of course, but, this had to be a big part of Bleach's niche for drawing in non-anime viewers when it first aired on adult swim on the weekends in the United States. Anime cons filled with countless reiterations of ulqiuorras, ichigos, and renjis... Their is a reason that this series became the most popular out of the big three for cosplay because fans enjoyed the detail, cultural variety and symbolism that manga artist Tite Kubo incorporated in the construction of all his characters. For a mainstream shonen series, it was unusual to see this kind of sensibility that was combining both western and eastern influences and while was also trying to establish where the fashion that each 'clan' has in Bleach comes from. 
Rockin' that '-- hairstyle, kubo gives us this supernatural shonen series that, similar to Yu Yu Hakusho, tells the story of a somewhat rebellious teenager. At it's heart, Bleach seems to want to do something more than to just have a punkish, emo main character training for battle and instead, a more colorful, diverse cast of characters differentiating itself from the darker and dismal one of Death Note's. Ichigo is an unusual main protagonist in that he possesses the ability to see ghosts while having a desire to protect them. Some of this desire comes from his childhood burden of his mother being killed by a hollow, the fictitious entities in Bleach that devour human souls and fight against the soul reapers. Ichigo, being a human, eventually obtains the power as a soul reaper but eventually finds out that their is a lot more to his own power than he once realized when he encounters other powerful races that exist in the universe.  Like many of it's shonen predecessors, Bleach lacks a story with serious depth just as it is informed by it's title suggesting that something will clear it's palette with titanium white. Tite Kubo chose to leave those backdrops completely blank in his manga  to provide more clarity to the design of his characters in his manga. Hence, this was a character-driven story and yet, fans were caught by surprise in the depth of Bleach's plot twists in how they enriched an arc and put an end to it's action that eventually got old pretty fast. Like all shonen that drag out to great lengths, power levels inevitably exceed logic and the plot twists feel sought after to the point that it ends up becoming the show's weakest device. Sometimes it only takes one of it's major characters to change the game entirely and the players involved and yet, also, being the show's biggest trepidation and complete cause of downfall. You begin to see this take fold by around episode -- when the main antagonist causes a a pivotal shift in the series by initiating prototypical warfare lasting for hundreds of episodes, consisting of --% plot and --% fighting. It's at this point of the series when it really strikes a lot of similarity to it's shonen grandfather known as Dragon Ball Z in how their is a constant footnote in every single battle that ""no one dies in the end"". 
I recommend Bleach to fans that are interested in a long running shonen that certainly won't disappoint for a particular length of time. In terms of production value, Bleach might be better than the other big two (Naruto and One Piece). The soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu will remain the most consistent part of the series as he will supply those action sequences with a wide variety of music inspired by different cultures around the world. I think their is a good argument that it's actually one of the best soundtracks for an anime series considering how this soundtrack is pretty damn good for over --- episodes. 
All in all, it was one of my favorite childhood shows that got me back into anime, so I still appreciate it for what it was back then and still is today. I think Bleach is one of the most well budgeted long running shonen series to this day and the second and third season being the most impressive. Bleach is a good series in the beginning, but loses it's charm when it's formula gets recycled following the Soul Society arc.

Did it live up to the trailer we were all shown?  
No 
Was it overhyped? 
Yes 
The OVA showed only one scene from the trailer and had none of its futuristic technology, the characters were generic and the main plot device (the Tokyo ---- terrorist attack) isn't even mentioned in the entire -- minutes the OVA had not even as some background exposition. 
the high school setting is unnecessary and limits what could have been done   
i am underwhelmed by this but had there been no hype for this show it might have gotten a pass, but it showed a promising trailer and was even endorsed some big names 
It bit more than it could actually chew, i was hoping this would fill the cyberpunk void in my soul but it only made it bigger

“He slept with every famous courtesan, attaining the very zenith of sensuality.” — Narrator 
“Damn!  Those Chinese herbs must be powerful as hell to prevent all those STD’s.” — Krunchyman 
In the days where internet porn did not exist (let alone a nudie mag), amorous old men peeked through tiny slits of doors while their soft-headed friend(s) slipped their trouser snake into a prestigious courtesan’s delicate — albeit used — flower.  It’s not the most decent way to get your clam sauce out, but not everyone can sling dick with ---- women and --- men (like Yunosuke).  
The Sensualist (Koushoku Ichidai Otoko) is not so much a story, as it is an artistic representation of Yunosuke’s — various — sexual encounters.  Symbolic imagery is a vital component to understanding the words that are never spoken.  The crane, for example, could be a reference to a hand-job or doggy-styled position in which the man grabs the women’s arms and pulls them back.  Numerous fish are shown during the acts of lust, which is known as a “pesce” in Italian (slang for Italian penis).  In addition, Fish are natural swimmers, meaning that the imagery could have been a reference to Yunosuke’s swimmer’s (i.e. sperm); or, perhaps, it was an acknowledgment of the “fishy” smell some women have in their vaginal region (but that seems rather crude for a visual metaphor). 
Intense shades of red are used to enhance the passion-filled scenes and exemplify the predilection of most men towards women dressed in red — hence the name, red-light districts.  And, of course, the abundance of flowers represents all the women (i.e. vagina’s) Yunosuke has been with over the years/decades.  If you don’t believe me, just look at a Georgia O’Keeffe paintings. 
While the artwork and associated symbolism were certainly impressive, the lack of a compelling story prevented The Sensualist from being a title worth remembering.  Essentially, the central message is that sex-starved individuals, who are subservient to the female form, should look for an island of sexy ladies when their youthful looks wither away to father time.

If you think that you can enjoy this anime as long as cliches don't bother you, think again.  There's a reason cliches exist- when done right, they work.  The problem with black clover is there literally nothing there OTHER THAN the cliches.   
The characters are very hollow, --dimensional and completely unrelatable representations of your usual cliches. Not one character brings any unique flavour to the anime. They are merely sock puppets repeating the same lines every episode, who were made only to complete the typical character checkboxes to get the series funded. You have to watch this for many episodes to really appreciate how dreadful they are, as nothing has changed in the -- episodes released so far.  THEY STILL RINSE AND REUSE THE EXACT SAME --liners AS THE FIRST EPISODES. 
The voice acting becomes uninspired as there is no reason for the voice actors to become invested in these excuses for characters.  The back stories are shallow, the main character is as bland and boring as you could imagine with a dreadful screaming voice used for --% of his lines. 
The art and animation gets worse with every episode- to the point that poorly drawn stills are used for ""action"" scenes in what is supposed to be the CLIMAX fight of the arc. Frames are reused on loop to save time and money. The fights are terrible and poorly conceived.  I recommend the viewers save their own time and money and stay away.

Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers. 
--- 
Shit, where do I start, man. Well, here's the thing: I've been watching anime for over five years, which means that I've seen several romance/harem series (everything from Maison Ikkoku to Love Hina). Most of them have the same traits, but in order to poke out a bit from each other, they'll have to be in different settings. The question is if it's different and well enough executed in a fashion that captivates the viewer. And I'll let it out straightaway: Princess Lover fails epicly at that. By looking at the title, you know that you're already fucked: 
Uh, so the main character, Arima is going to succeed Arima Group Corporation, and by the sounds of it, it looks like it's like the biggest company in the world. And who's gonna take over it in near future? A teenager that knows shit about business. Who in the world would give away such a big responsibility to a relative they barely knew just like that? I can go on and on about this plot convenience, but hey, I'll spare you for that. 
Because succeeding the corporation is just a lame excuse to enter a rich girls' school (okey, there are also boys there, but we barely get to see them). And of course, who do we meet there? It's the pink-haired girl whom he saved and his fiancee. And to answer your question straightaway: Yes, they do have big breasts. And yes, the pink-haired girl hugs Arima all the time with her gonzanga breasts. She's your typical cheery girl with a cheery voice with a hand that likes to wave awfully a lot. And the fiancee? She's your typical, somewhat-shy girl who speaks little. And when she does speak, she speaks kinda without emotions. She has coincidentally fencing as a hobby, which coincidentally matches with Arima's kendo, so they have by chance some common ground, I guess. With other words, we've seen these type of personalities before. A lot. So what personality are we missing now? Tsundere? And yes, there is a tsundere girl in the series.  You'll know it straightaway when she pops up for the first time (hint: she has a slightly annoying/whiny voice, which all tsunderes have, so I guess that's alright). Did I mention that we also have a big-breasted maid? The anime industry sure knows what we like. And Arima Teppei is your average male main character. 
And that's not the best part yet (and by that, I mean the worst). The thing is with harem series, is that the plot can't be all fluffy and boobilicious all the time; it also needs some drama. Without telling too much: It's fucking ridiculous when you get to it. If you by any chance come to episode - or - (I don't quite remember which one), you're gonna have a fuckin' laugh. I swear, the plot progression from there might be the most retarded one in harem anime history. It's clearly not to be taken seriously. I don't know, but I sure facepalmed a lot during that particular episode. And by of what I've heard; the series is based off of an H-game, so that kind of sucky plot is expected, I guess. 
Is there anything good in Princess Lover? The art is decent and not ugly to look at. The animation is standard, but not bad. And if you're looking for ecchi-ness, you've found it. A lot of booooobies. *coughEDcough* The music is not memorable at all; it's just generic. Visually speaking, the opening was pleasing to look at. In fact, I remember the breasts more than the music itself. And btw, Arima Isshin's voice is so badass (Wakamoto Norio is badass after all). 
So unless you enjoy torturing yourself or your friends, avoid Princess Lover at all cost. I fuckin' used --- minutes of my life saving your eyes. At least the show wasn't as bad as Koi Koi Seven. If you wanna see only big breasts and ecchi-ness, then there's actually better shows for that, like ""He is my Master!"". If you're looking for a good romance/harem anime, then go watch ""Ichigo ---%"" (the manga is better, though), ""True Tears"", ""Lovely Complex"" or ""ef - a tale of memories"". 
YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE.

""Overall, the plot to this movie was absolutely insulting, and I feel it didn't use it's time well at all (which is impressive when it's goddamn - hours long), and the world it tries to set up is an absolute joke. Like the sweet, soothing melodies of Cannibal Corpse... ...the Boy and the Beast is:  
Too edgy. In your face. And desperate to evoke a reaction out of you."" 
Honestly, this is one of the most disappointing and infuriating things I've ever watched. And so many people praise this movie. 
If you are interested in a long-form comedy/analytical review of this movie, then here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxKdW_cwBLM 
It's in the style of YourMovieSucks and Mr. Plinkett, if that can convince you further.

I really loved Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. It was an impressive game with compelling gameplay and storyline. However, it's anime counterpart definitely under-performed. The anime itself felt very rushed, and trying to fit the whole game into -- episodes was a challenge in and of itself. I don't have much to say on the art, but it felt choppy paired with the executions, which came directly out of the game. The dubbed cast was mediocre, I was expecting a little more diversity, and maybe some not well known VA's? The characters were beautiful. Each one had a different personalities and I felt a deep connection to all of them, no matter how much screen time they received. Overall, the characters were well rounded and well crafted. Besides the quality, the storyline matched that of the game. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and was suspenseful as ever. Overall, it's nowhere near the quality of the game. I'd only recommend it if you don't have the system required to play Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. I was expecting better, and hopefully the anime adaption of the second game (if made,) will be better.

The story is simple, - shut-ins are sent to another world where all conflict is to be resolved by games. It's simple. The story itself is nothing that spectacular but it's still good.  Story -/--. 
The art is simply the best part of this anime. It is absolutely breath taking! Art easy --/--. 
The soundtrack is great! It really fits the tone of the anime. It really amplifies the mood. And note: The opening 'This Game' is one of the best anime openings of all time. Sound -/--. 
The Characters are some of the weakest and strongest parts of this anime. The mains are are great and play off of each other and the rest of the cast as well. But the mains do lack some form of... originality...? Sora is a -- year virgin with sexual needs, I think that this part is handled well and often made me laugh. But I think Shiro is where it really starts to fall apart. It's blatantly stated that she's a genius, but it almost feels like Sora is the smarter one. It says Shiro is the genius but Sora always is making the moves and seems to be overall more intelligent than Shiro. And pretty much all the other characters are really - dimensional. Stephanie= dumb, idiot, but of every joke in the first - episodes. Jibril = fan service bot. Plus this anime feels the need to add -- characters an episode. So sometimes it just feels crammed. Still, every character is still charming? WITCHCRAFT! Character -/--. 
The enjoyment! I ENJOYED THIS SO MUCH! With all it's flaws it still was fun to watch. And part of that might have been the fan service and pop culture references, but I really enjoyed this. Plus the thrill of finding out how they won the game is so satisfying, I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. Enjoyment --/-- 
The overall rating is very good, would recommend. The thrill of the game is so satisfying. Overall -/--.

A cast of flawed characters trying to figure out life in the most relatable way, with a killer soundtrack and great vocal performances. The fights are well stated battles of personal philosophy with INCREDIBLE animation (this season contains the highest quality fight scene I've yet to see in anime).  
The exact means by which antagonists act at times is flawed at times, and the conclusion didn't seem to pack as much bang as the penultimate battle. If you like to watch anime that looks good WATCH THIS. If you like good character driven anime, YOU SHOULD REALLY WATCH THIS. Finding both of those flawlessly wrapped into one package makes this a straight up masterpiece.

How do i put this trainwreck in words? Oh wait, I already did. 
When I see the name Gangsta, I did hope for an anime abou Gangster not a show about super power dudes hide under the shadows of dreadful killers. 
Manglobe is an alright studio, it has its fairshare of good and bad animes with the later being a bit more. They also seem to love making supernatural shows which didn't help the case of Gangsta very much. Contradictory, it worsen Gangsta, wasted its potential premiere. 
In a town where anything can happen as the characters stated multiple times, it did seem like nothing really happened in the anime. Nothing significant to the plot, or at least engaging provokes. It did start out fine but gradually going nowhere, even at the end, I don't ever thing there's a show that would left it hanging in the middle like that. It just ends, like the story I've spent - hours watching didn't need to continue or something. 
By introducing too many characters, our main ones aren't fleshed out enough unless they thought that showing back stories every - minutes helped, but clearly it didn't. Many of the side cast feels extremely flat, they're just there so the plot can move forward. And finally as I expected, when I haven't known anything about many characters, the anime ended.  
I truly think this is just a waste of time. If I can save your time by reviewing it, don't need to thank me. Just move on.

Slight spoilers ahead. 
I have two main criticisms for this show. 
The first criticism addresses a problem that the show somewhat successfully solves, though there remains room for improvement. The problem has to do with how to handle the repetitious showing of each skater's programs. The songs are the same, the performance is the same, the only main difference is whether the skater lands their jumps. The show's solution is largely to use this as an opportunity to show us the character's state of mind, not just as it pertains to how their performance is going, but how their performance relates to their larger concerns and anxieties about their career and life goals. 
The show alternatively could have used new performances each time the skater appeared on the ice, though this probably would have required more effort on the animators' part, and might have been taken creative liberties with its depiction of professional figure skating. The idea here is that these new performances would be reflections of the character's state of mind at the time, possibly forgoing the need for an internal monologue. 
The show in very few occasions utilizes this idea of reflecting a character's state of mind in their physical performance: Yuri in his first few short program performances opens up increasingly erotically, and Michele Crispino's (brother to Sala Crispino) second performance that we see is far more melancholic than his first one, reflecting his reaction to his sister's separation. These are good, but the only instances I recall. 
I would have liked to have seen this method pursued further, particularly since the internal monologues, while themselves effective (albeit somewhat a crude way of presenting the same information), end up falling short due to weaknesses in the show's narrative, which brings up my second and largest point. 
The show's narrative is far too quick. The show sets up this arc for Yuri where he'll come to learn what love or eros is, which largely concludes halfway through, rendering his skating performances less interesting. Yuri(o), who was set up as Yuri's rival, receives far less attention than Yuri. There's some interesting potential with Yuri(o), but we're instead left with asides rather than developments: for instance, Yuri(o)'s concern that he'll soon physically mature in a way that will mean having to alter his skating style. Victor, despite receiving the second most amount of air time, receives possibly even less narrative attention than Yuri(o). 
All the other skaters receive interesting attention, but again, it's done far too quickly without really establishing the characters, exploring them and their backgrounds, and then developing them, their issues and resolutions. 
I believe that had this show been twice as long, and properly attentive, this could have been an easy - out of --.

This anime would be okay for anybody that enjoys a gore saw-like story. The storyline for the anime was absolutely dreadful, there were too many plot-holes, and although the story was understandable it would just jump from one scene and skip a lot of necessary information. 
The art however, fit the horror theme with dark and dreary lighting throughout the series. The art is something that this show could be commended on. 
The music and sound effects for the show fit the mood and make the show more suspenseful and creepy. The voice acting however, varied with some parts being very convincing while others were just mediocre. 
Character development could have been better, if the writers had made the story go more in depth with the characters  it may have been possible to get more of an attachment to them. 
The show however is entertaining and may be a decent watch if you aren't expecting too much when going into it. The show is of course gory, and the sound effects for the gore are occasionally cringe worthy.  
Overall the series was sub-par, but considering it was only - episodes, that could be expected. I dont particularly recommend the series, but I wouldn't stop anybody who would want to see it.

Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans is another Gundam series set in an alternate timeline, this one being the Post Disaster timeline. Set in a future where hostilities between human settlers on Mars and the Earth Sphere are escalating due to Earth's influence on Martian affairs through the private military organization Gjallarhorn, the series is prominently focused on a private Martian military group called Tekkadan who are given the job of protecting Kudelia Aina Bernstein, the young daughter of a Martian political family who seeks to travel to Earth to persuade the Earth Sphere government to grant independence to Martian settlers and inform them of Gjallarhorn's corruption. As Tekkadan make their journey to Earth while protecting Kudelia, they are continuously hunted down by Gjallarhorn forces seeking to prevent Kudelia from making it to Earth. 
Iron Blooded Orphans has many of the typical elements you would find from a Gundam series. There are escalating conflicts between Earth and space residents, prejudice felt from those having unique abilities of some sort (Alaya-Vijnana implanted pilots in place of Newtypes), a strong willed young woman seeking to settle conflicts between the opposing sides, a high death count, corrupt individuals on the opposing side taking advantage of hostilities for their personal gain, and a young man piloting the highly powerful Gundam mecha used throughout the series. While drawing from these elements, Iron Blooded Orphans actually uses them to create its own unique plot and character developments and give it its own unique identity. 
A strong element that Iron Blooded Orphans offers up is exploring the problems faced by child soldiers through the fighting they undergo. This gets prominent focus through Mikazuki's character as due to his upbringing as a child soldier, he is psychologically unstable from his inability to properly express his emotions and deal with social situations outside of military settings. The boy will usually find himself giving into berserk rages while in battle, is completely merciless to enemy forces and has difficulty properly expressing emotions; traits that he is well aware of internally throughout the series. His interactions with Kudelia at varying points in the series lead Mikazuki to get some gradual developments in improving his social skills and empathy toward others. Besides Mikazuki, the series also explores the good deal of abuse that child soldiers are subjected to through military factions like the Brewers as the children are subjected to fear and abuse, as well as being forced into getting the risky Alaya Vijnana implants used to empower the mobile suits they pilot. 
Iron Blooded Orphans plays up on many of the strengths that make Universal Century titles like Gundam Unicorn and Zeta Gundam worthwhile and memorable titles in the Gundam franchise. The series explores the conflict between Tekkadan and Gjallarhorn from the perspectives of both sides as viewers get introduced to characters among both sides that have a good deal of depth in their motivations and personalities, making the majority of characters among both factions relatable to the audience. Some of the characters find their personal beliefs challenged from confronting the harsh realities of war, this prominently shown through Kudelia's exposure to the escalation in Earth and Mars' hostilities toward one another and Tekkadan's continued struggles against Gjallarhorn. Besides the mentioned child soldiers, the series is also not afraid to show how brutal and harsh war can be with major characters being killed off, the morality of some characters deteriorating from dealing with war's brutality and influential figures among Gjallarhorn exploiting said hostilities for their personal gain. 
The series does have its occasional bumps in quality though, mostly stemming from the typical flaws of Gundam titles. Mikazuki is mostly unstoppable as the pilot of Gundam Barbatos, killing any kind of suspense for whether or not he survives any battles throughout the series. Some characters in the series are portrayed to be rather shallow and are over-the-top in their villainy, notable case being Kudel Cadel of the Brewers. Also, the series doesn't escape the occasional annoying habit of having mobile suit pilots angrily yelling out ideologies and motives at their enemies during heated battles that are found from a number of past Gundam titles. 
Visually, Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans is easily one of the better quality titles released this past year. The series sports a great amount of visual detail put into the designs of its scenery, character and mecha designs; accompanied with a bright color palette. The mecha designs mostly borrow off of visual details used from past Gundam titles, including Barbatos maintaining the classic Gundam appearance. Mecha battle scenes offer up the animated highlight of the series as battles between Tekkadan and enemy forces take place in a variety of locations throughout the series that include space colonies, space, reentry into Earth and on the Earth itself. The fight scenes are mostly fluid, have great choreography and the variety of locations offer diversity in the ways that mecha battles are fought throughout the series. 
Overall, Iron Blooded Orphans is easily among the best alternate continuity titles that you can find within the Gundam franchise. Offering up all the strengths of the Gundam franchise with its own spin on them and having a strong focus on the effects that war has on child soldiers, Iron Blooded Orphans is a definite recommendation for seasoned Gundam fans or those looking for a worthwhile mecha title to get into without having to delve too deep into the convoluted continuities of the Gundam franchise.

A lot of complaints are made about the fact that the Sci-fi universe isn't explored and explained enough, and I sort of agree with this argument, as the futuristic context is a bit pointless to the underlying themes of the show. To me, the setting was only a pretext to write a story about love, the inevitability of endings and how to deal with loss. Although using robots with a - years life expectancy is an unusual and original approach to those themes, in the end it doesn't serve the story in any other way than giving limited time to the female protagonist. It's easier to appreciate Plastic Memories once you understand the show is a romance at heart with Sci-fi elements, but it's still a shame to see all of the unexplored aspects of a narrative involving things as complex as relationships between androids and humans. I wish we had gotten a bit more of a commentary on the matter, or at least more explanations on Giftias and the reasons of their existence. The show had so much material to explore, especially considering the seriousness of the subjects it tackles, but decided to take a different path. 
This is the main problem I have with Plastic Memories: it lacks focus. It has something to say, but it keeps drifting away from it, as it wants to do too many things at the same time. The concept of falling in love with someone whose end is near is tragic and compelling, but it is not properly focused on until the last few episodes: the romance is introduced in the beginning and then sort of forgotten before reappearing again, instead of being build up throughout the show,which makes it not as natural as it could have been. The show goes in all sorts of directions, often lingering in slice-of-life territory, which would have been fine if it had been well dosed. But I feel like there is too much of it; and Plastic Memories could have used this time for more relevant storytelling, such as fleshing out the main characters, adding more logic to the Sci-fi universe, finding ways to convey the powerful message that the show already has, or exploring a romance that is in and out of itself deep and complex. Not that it doesn't do these things, it just that often the more generic slice-of-life atmosphere takes the spotlight, to the detriment of the story and its impact on the viewer. 
*spoilers* 
However, when the show does get on track and concentrates on it's core themes it does it very well and manages to create some very touching moments, delivering emotions with subtlety and realism. The romance, although it can feel unconvincing at first, is not melodramatic and feels authentic in the end. Isla and Tsukasa become comfortable together, and as a pair they are just plain sweet. The last episode in particular is done wonderfully, as the viewer has to go trough the grueling experience of watching the couple's last day together. The show stops to wander around, and just delves straight into these characters and their emotions as they face the inevitable, setting up what is to me one of the saddest ending to anything I've ever watched. The way the two characters say their goodbyes to each other and Tsukasa's pain afterwards; it's all done extremely well, in this sort of sad but serene atmosphere. It feels real, brutal and bitter while being very beautiful at the same time.  
*spoilers end* 
I've got to admit, the ending did it for me; it touched me so much that I don't think I can be that objective when giving my final verdict. Because despite all of the issues this show has, to me, those last episodes make up for it. The themes are superbly expressed by the end of the story and it has emotional depth, reminding us about the reality of loss and death that goes with love and life. Plastic Memories had such an impact on me that it would be dishonest towards myself to give it lower than an -. It does have a lot a problems regarding the execution of its storytelling, but when it works, it's powerful, and it's going on my list of anime that I won't forget. 
Now I am going to go cry in a corner for a week, goodbye.

I'm gonna start by saying that I have seen all of episodes of Gintama series from episode ----- so this review will cover the whole series.  
My rendezvous with Gintama started when a friend of mine showed me a clip of an episode when I asked for a funny anime I can get hooked on. So I watched a few episodes but I didn't get hooked so I abandoned it but months later, I just decided to go ahead and watch more and it is easily one of the best decisions I have made. 
*Story* 
Though Gintama doesn't have that characteristic of most animes where a single story consumes the series, that is what makes Gintama simply because you can't restrict Gintama with one story as it will probably become the dull ""samurai fights the aliens out of Earth and they gain back freedom"" story that follows typical patterns and becomes predictable. The randomness is what keeps up the anime despite what the characters say about the anime itself. That being said, it's not all randomness. Arcs that last --- episodes do happen. Even though they are short, they manage to explain what the whole story is all about, reveal more about the characters and their evil/good sides while teaching a moral lesson at the same time which some animes fail to do at the space of -- or more episodes.  
*Art* 
The art is simple. Not too flashy but not too dull either. Just the right type. It can show the expression of the characters like Gintoki being scared, panicking or shocked at something. It is also able to shows things like effects of steel katanas smashing into each other with sparks coming out impressively which I personally think greatly emphasizes the emotions of the two characters clashing. Another example of the simple yet satisfying art is the fact from just a silhouette, the characters are easily recognizable. However, the animation can sometimes be choppy and some symbols like the Tokugawa seal isn't drawn right so it isn't recognizable but nonetheless, the art still deserves a high rating of -. 
*Sound*  
Since Gintama is a comedy anime full of ridiculous yet humorous poses of insults and gestures, sounds are extra vital and it doesn't lack it. The sound effects are so accurate that even if the viewer isn't looking at the scene, they can guess who is insulting and what kind of gesture are they making. The soundtracks greatly emphasizes the gestures and sets the right atmosphere. For example, when Gintoki finds out something shocking and embarrassing, that sound of trumpets going 'whengwheng' makes it even more hilarious or when someone gives a life lesson, the recognizable sad music sets the right mood and creates an effect that makes even the viewer think about what is being said. The openings and endings always fit the season like when DOES played Donten for the Benizakura arc and it felt just right. 
*Character* 
When characters appear in an episode, they are supposed to leave a mark on the viewer and make them even more recognizable and distinctive. Gintama characters does more than that. They don't just leave a mark but they also make the viewer ""Wait...that character is supposed to be....why did that person change...?"". What I meant by that is not only the characters show their personality that the viewer would normally think because of their appearance but they can also break out of that character and turn like a totally different person. But those are not to say I liked them all the time. There were times where someone like Shinpachi would overreact and play his ""straight man"" role too much. Those times made me wish that why won't the glasses boy just play along. Never the less, the characters are well made. 
*Enjoyment* 
My enjoyment and experience for Gintama has been one of the best. Not only am I only able to sit down and relax but I am also able to have fun on my own and laugh like crazy. I can also rely on Gintama to cheer my day up and make it great even though it's gloomy and all I do is sit at home. But the whole reason I enjoyed Gintama was because it parodied other animes and turned it into a Gintama version but they didn't just stop there. They even parodied themselves at one point and gave it a different title. Another thing why Gintama is very enjoyable is its ability to become funny, whacky, action packed and heart breaking in the change of a scene. 
*Overall* 
Overall, I found Gintama very enjoyable with all it's different moments, seiyuus, songs and characters like Gintoki and many others to lead the anime into success and leave a permanent imprint on the viewer. Gintama is highly recommended to those who wanna watch an anime that is unpredictable and will make them laugh, have them on the edge of their seat and make them tear up while being taught a moral lesson.  
The review is over and I hope it helped. Thanks for reading and have fun with Gintama!

This anime is an extremely cute, perhaps too cute (in a good way), well done slice of life anime about an eccentric cute girl told through the eyes of our protagonist [insert stock slice of life protagonist here]. My involvements with the slice of life genre are Clannad, Anohana, Haruhi, Kimi no Na wa, and K-On! And, I can tell you with full certainty that this series is strictly worse than all of those. I know my experience in the genre skews my view on this series, but I'd have to call it below average. The main character Rikka is the only redeemable factor of the anime and she does an outstanding job at carrying the entire series on her shoulders, but there's only so much a single character can do. The plot is lackluster and every other character is as forgettable as the title. The visuals are amazing though. Watch one or two episodes and if you fall in love with Rikka like I did, keep watching it. Otherwise go watch something better.

I watched two episodes of this show before I started ignoring it. Because I was so vehemently disappointed with the animu industry's inability to make likeable male leads, and I was so sick of the US anime licensing companies' promoting (i.e. lying in order to sell crap to everyone). 
The only reason I'm starting to watch this again? Someone over at -chan's /a/, along with pictures to back it up, having a nasty tirade against Kazuma Yagami and the fact that he's not just like every other animu male lead. 
I WILL agree that Kazuma comes off as a gr... I take it back. 
I, too, would wanna be ""powerful"" enough to kick every other douche-bag's ass. But human beings are funny (as noted in Chromeshelled Regios); they don't wanna pay for their past douche-bag-ism. In fact, the effects are negative; they want more ""power"" so they can come back and kick YOUR ass. 
And then there's Spiderman's Peter Parker being told by his uncle that with great power comes great responsibility. So of course, you kick everybody's ass and they expect you to save the day. ^_^; 
Kazuma's the anti-thesis of what you expect from every current animu male lead. He's straightforward, strong, unwilling to put up with $#--, and still has a heart despite being a jerk. 
Ayano, on the other hand, is yet another cliched tsundere who'd do great if the male lead's a luckless pansy. Unfortunately for her, Kazuma's NOT a luckless pansy; hence she ends up becoming the nice-looking butt of the physical slapstick comedy. (Major kudos to Cherami Leigh for her work voicing her.) 
Ren's the ""Larry"" of the trio; having enough power to hold his own... but always on the sidelines crying when the KazAya banter commences. 
The art and animation are NOT good (because ""who wants to watch a show about a shounen lead indiscriminately kicking ass?""). But atleast it's not upskirt panty shots. 
And yes. Pardon me for taking so long to come back to this show. It's just... The tons of pansy-ass-ness I'm seeing from the lot of shounen in the lot of animu today... I nearly lost all hope.

Girls Beyond the Wasteland could have been something, but ended up being a dull time. 
The plot where high school kids develop a game is actually something that has been done before. Last year, there was Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend, which had the exact same premise. Because of that, many will wind up comparing both of them. If I may be honest, Saekano had a better execution. 
Comparisons aside, I did like the first episode. I felt the establishment of the characters was great, and it was funny. However, as the series went on, it started to get a little boring. There is also something about the heme (being the world is a ""wasteland"") that's bothering me. I'm finding it difficult to write anything about it as it's not utilized that well, despite it's occasional mentioning. 
Continuing with what I was saying with episode one, it introduced most of out characters in a very natural way. This is in regards to three friends; I was able to tell right away the kind of relationship they were in. Characters introduced later on just felt like add-ons that are interesting. 
The animation looked a bit weird; not really in terms of movement, but the character designs. There was also consistent flaws in addition to the poor story. 
It's really a shame the series ended up like it did; I really wanted it to be good after enjoying the first episode. Obviously, I can't recommend it, and since it's much better than this, I'd rather say go watch Saekano.

What can I say? I loved Phantom. 
Story: - 
The story of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom basically takes place in three arcs. I found the first two to be frankly amazing: great plot, mood, character development etc--not much to say about them other than you will probably really enjoy them. My main problem with Phantom's story is the third arc. While I still found it entertaining, there were quite a few parts in this arc that required a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I still couldn't stop watching, which is saying a lot, but some people will probably be really annoyed at the way certain developments are handled that seem to make little sense in the context of the story. In particular the last two episodes made so little sense that they bordered on absurd at times. But since the majority of the series was really well handled, I give the story an -. 
Art: -- 
The art is really great. I love the character designs, and the action sequences look fluid. The dark aesthetic fits the mood and the settings are occasionally quite beautiful. No complaints. 
Sound: -- 
If I could give the sound an -- I would! I am not the kind of person who usually pays much attention to the music in shows unless it is so good that it's impossible not to notice. Well, this show fits in that category. The music comes on at crucial moments and just sets the mood perfectly, I think most people who watch this show will enjoy the music very much. Besides that, the voice acting was very good. 
Character: - 
The main characters in this show were quite interesting and sympathetic, and though many of the side characters were not what you would call likable, they were still entertaining to watch. My main issue, again, was how some of them behaved in the final arc, as it didn't seem consistent, but overall I thought the character development of this show was great. Many of the characters have changed and grown quite a bit by the end. 
Enjoyment: -.- 
I could not stop watching this, it was so addicting. I was absolutely planning on giving it a -- up until the final - episodes. However the ending didn't ruin the series for me, just made me ""wtf"" a bit. So take from that what you will. 
Overall: - 
Great series, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of action and dark psychological themes, or even if you just want to look at some pretty characters (they're very pretty I assure you). Go watch now!

""the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present and future are equally real, and that time is tenseless"" 
Hello readers 
there i go presenting the review of probably the best science fiction series world of anime has to offer . They say you can't improve on perfection, yet Steins;Gate - does just that. Taking what made the original story so great by awesome characters and a much darker theme makes Steins;Gate - the perfect continuation to a story. 
""no one know what the future holds, thats why its potential is infinite"" 
story(probably --/--) 
I love how Steins;Gate - embraces the Beta timeline. 
As i mention steins gate - involves a much darker theme and more thrilling impact than its previous season.As we seen in previous season, the series left off at the end of its --rd episode, except in this version of events our hero Okabe didn't go through with the heroics that brought Steins;Gate prime to its happy ending. Instead, Okabe has gone full on tortured fallen hero, even going so far as to don a jet black ensemble to reflect the depths of his anguish. he is emotionally exhausted, burnt out on play-acting, and haunted by trauma that flares up whenever he's reminded of that one cruel summer. This episode's idle conversations between very familiar friends did a great job of asserting how badly Okabe had suffered, making his resistance to Suzuha asking for further help feel entirely natural. 
In short with giving much spoiler's ahead i feel story seems much more darker and thrilling than previous season. Its still lacks some originality also i feel it skipping some of its detail's but it has great potential, some starting episodes are bit drafty and will surely able to give chills through its darker theme's. 
Animation and art(-/--)  
White fox absolutely fantastic job here.The episode does a great job of tweaking the series into something much more unsettling than Steins'Gate's early episodes; dramatic closeups and moody camera work ensure that the audience is never unaware of the deep psychological stress that haunts Okabe at all times. 
On other hand it also feel's somewhat limited by its color palette and a little lethargic in its pacing.Its similar to Re:Zero, appears to be applying some of the same elements and themes from Subaru’s hellish existence when bringing Okabe’s visions to life.though its still great and you will get what you expect. 
""My one constant, the one truth that never failed me was you"" 
Character(--/--) 
Its not unknown that this series got some awesome character complexity that is mostly one of the major requirement of sci-fi thriller story.However i feel everything you learnt about characters like Mayuri, Daru and Moeka Kiryu in Steins;Gate may now no longer be true. You will still find their characteristics the same – Mayuri is still a cute, ditsy young girl, Daru still the pervert and Moeka the shy reporter who hides behind her mobile phone. 
Okabe however seems depressed and hopeless and seems like a shell of his former self, its make audience more curious about Okabe's future. 
Enjoyment(-/--) 
Steins gate - is absolutely amazing in every way. I really loved original SG and was waiting for really long time for this. It is definitely at least as good as the first.Its unpredictable,more darker, and always have potential to surprise viewer's with unexpected ending's. Its really fun series for Sci-fi Thriller lovers as well as in short its more like anime verson of christopher nolan's movie's got similar addiction, excitment,unpredectiblity and thrills. 
Conclusion 
Hands down to one of the most amazing sci-fi series ever produced I believe Steins gate zero has absolute potential as going down as a contender of best series of this year. If you are the fan of -st season like me you surely find yourself in heaven while watching this series. 
Its surely on par with its predecessor's high standards. It remains to be seen if the show will be able to make a compelling story out of a scenario that fans already know a happier outcome for, but the quality of this premiere has assuaged my fears. Even if poor Okabe has to suffer for it, it's good to have Steins;Gate back.

Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with the little aspects of ordinary life that make people who they are. Bunny Drop is one such work, and it executes this beautifully. It's a small, unambitious story about ordinary people but it carries itself with a certain measure of refined dignity that's rarely seen in anime in general, let alone the slice of life genre. It has genuine insight into parenthood, but it never talks down to its audience and you don't have to be a parent to get behind the story. This is quite honestly one of the most accessible anime I've ever seen. 
The staff of Production IG handled this show with the sort of nurturing care rarely seen in a slice of life anime, which usually tend to get the short end of the stick production-wise. Backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, colors are warm and rich, and even when the character models go into super-deformed mode (which happens often) movements are fluid and quality control remains excellent. Of particular note are the opening segments of each episode, which are animated in a soft crayon-esque style reminiscent of a children's storybook. That's to say nothing of the charming character designs. Every character is distinctive in an understated way that isn't too far-removed from reality. Family members really do resemble one another (which is especially great since this is a show about family), but not to the point that they could be called carbon copies. The children are cute without defaulting to an overly moe-fied style as Japanese animation is wont to do. This is a spectacular visual effort that sets the tone for the show perfectly. 
The music is mostly comprised of low-key string pieces, and can best be described as charming for its gentle, sincere simplicity. It can get a bit repetitive, a good portion of the soundtrack is comprised of several different instrumentations of the same basic piece, but perhaps due to the series' short length it never wears out its welcome. I've seen longer anime get away with worse, so really I have no complaints. 
There's one thing about anime voice acting in Japan that makes it perfectly suited to this kind of show, and that's their willingness to fill their child roles with real children. It does happen in the States occasionally (Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist comes to mind immediately) but it's not nearly as common. Rin, her friend Kouki, her cousin Reina and several minor child characters are all played by age-appropriate voice actors, which makes them sound genuine as only real children can. Ayu Matsuura in particular does a great job as Rin, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear more from her in the years to come as she grows and matures into new roles. The adults sound pretty good too, at least to my ears. The lack of a dub does create a problem for some potential viewers, though, which is unfortunate because otherwise I'm fairly confident I can recommend this series to just about anyone. 
Bunny Drop is first and foremost an emotional series. It's a pretty consistently upbeat series but it never goes too far into ""flowery sunshine and rainbows"" territory. This show works because of how true it is to the small, understated moments that a parent and child really do share every day. These moments never feel unnecessary because Daikichi is as new to Rin and to parenting as we are (unless, y'know, you're already a parent), so we get to discover these things as he does. Both Daikichi and Rin have time to develop in small, believable ways and build a realistic family relationship. Daikichi is always well-meaning, and you never doubt he's suited to raise Rin, but he does run into a lot of problems that he overcomes with believable difficulty. Rin, meanwhile, is a well-mannered girl who is in some ways wise beyond her years, but she still faces common everyday problems for a child her age like wetting the bed, and she confronts these problems as any child would, so even when she acts a bit old for her age you never forget she's six. The two of them complement each other sweetly but never come across as saccharine--no small feat. They're not particularly complex characters, but they're still charming and memorable, and feel like real people rather than archetypes. 
Actually, ""charming"", ""memorable"" and ""real"" are good ways to describe the entire cast. From Daikichi's family to Rin's playmates, they all act remarkably true to the people we could really meet at these various stages in our lives. The show uses its surprisingly large cast to its full advantage, with every character acting as a foil to Daikichi and Rin in some way or another. For example, there's Daikichi's mother Sachiko, who's already been through everything Daikichi is going through right now, and his sister Kazumi, who's on the cusp of starting a family of her own. Both of them initially question Daikichi's decision, but after warming up to Rin and reflecting on their own lives we do see them change for the better in little ways. The lessons are simple but important ones, and they come across naturally through everyday interactions rather than being crammed down our throats. 
If there's one character in this series who deserves special mention, though, it's Masako, the mother who abandoned Rin with her father. When Daikichi meets her, she's nothing like he expects her to be, and it turns out her reasons for leaving Rin are more complex than pure apathy. She's focused on her own career and not at all suited to being a mother, but despite her efforts to distance herself she can't help but care about Rin in her own way. She doesn't feel that she was ready to be a mother, and maybe she's right, but that doesn't make her a bad person. That the show managed to portray her in such a light is probably its greatest achievement, and the closest the series comes to delving into the dark side of parenthood. Her character arc is so good, in fact, that it casts the show's greatest flaw into sharp relief. 
You see, Bunny Drop falls into a bit of a comfort zone, in that it's severely limited in its thematic and emotional spectrum. Not that it doesn't bring anything meaningful to the table, but the picture it paints of parenthood is a little too rosy to encompass the full experience. Daikichi never really messes up, the little mistakes he make and the details that slip through the cracks are quickly forgiven and forgotten, and many of the difficulties he and Rin might have to face are discussed but never actually portrayed, such as the possibility that Rin might be teased for her family circumstances. Am I being too cynical? Perhaps, but it's arcs like Masako's that prove that the show can strive for something more without sacrificing its purity and sincerity; Masako wasn't in the right, exactly, but what she did was still understandable, sympathetic even, and it shed light on some truths about parenthood that are rarely addressed. The show needed more material like that, but aside from that one arc and a pretty powerful opening episode (the scene where Daikichi takes Rin home is actually a great moment), Bunny Drop systematically dodged every opportunity to become something more. I mentioned Daikichi's mother earlier, and on a whole I didn't dislike her character, but one thing that bothered me was that even after she warmed up to Rin she never apologized for treating her so coldly early on. That's something the show would have been better for confronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run. 
What we're left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can't write it off as meaningless fluff. It does have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it's true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll on the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps that's for the best, as I've had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but even if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn't make it good. Not that it's bad, mind you, it's certainly better than seeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that's too bad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series' charming tone, so I can't fault it too much. Some anime just aren't meant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good. 
Bunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It's not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is it the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire show. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.

I just can't believe how cliche is this story goes. Louise summons Saito but actually she bullies him and treats him like SHIT. Even during the battle with Waldo, Saito has his will to protect Louise so he gets stronger and defeat Waldo. 
You know I actually could not believe that I really hate most tsunderes. Just like Kaname Chidori from FMP & Ayano Kannagi from KnS. Louise is really a loud-mouth, likes to talk bad about people, demanding, rude, arrogant and selfish. Louise always wants to have her way all the way, otherwise she will bash people up even like Saito. I do really feel bad about Saito after all the treatment that Louise bestowed upon him. 
Louise in the battle with Waldo, she is a damsel in distress waiting for Saito to save her. Oh no, not another cliche with damsel in distress. Why is it that most action animes I see feature damsel in distress? How can there be a unique anime without damsel in distress? I also feel that it is ok for Saito to make friends with the girls but as long as he is not obsessed with them but it is normal for a guy to like a girl anyway.  
But anyway, this anime is not so engaging (-/--). By the way, the art and sound is just nice.

(This was written in ----. Posting now cause why not?) 
Most anime are made to sell or promote their source materials via it be manga, light novels, or video games. Escha and logy is the latter. Escha and logy is set in a fantasy world with magic, witches, and alchemy. But due to certain circumstances the world is slowly coming to an end. So the people of the world decide to work together to try and halt their spending doom. The story follows our two protagonist, Escha and logy. 
The show is like a slice of life in a fantasy world. Most of the episodes are episodic with only one plot line being brought up at near the end of the series. This is one of my main gripes with the series. The show was awfully boring for the most part. We got to learn the core mechanics for the world and nothing else happens after. You think with the worlds impending doom there would be some kind of urgency, but guess not.  
The budget for this show was pretty much non existent. Lot of the artwork looked jarring at times. The animation wasn't very good. The movement wasn't very smooth  and looked very unnatural at times. Also I understand many studios use recycled animations, but when the same scene happens four times in a row its very noticeable. The color palate for this show was very dull and bleak, which did fit for the show and its setting. 
The characters for this show are just the basic archetypes that we see all the time. Nothing is really interesting about them. The designs are pretty bland and they're kept pretty much one note for majority of the show.  
So this show was pretty much made to promote the games. Did it do a good job? Maybe it did since I'm kinda interested in them. Would I recommenced to any looking to have a good time? The answer is NO. This anime will be forgotten like so many others and only be remembered by the few who did watch them.

First things first: because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main story of the Naruto filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. I prefer to think of it as misplaced OVA material. 
Fillers aside, I find this an awesome series, very well constructed, mixing great battle intensity with intricate major and side plots, and placing focus on character development. Only in its last arc does it drag for too long, and for a while it becomes almost arcade like - battle after battle after battle. Story stays on hold for a while, and for that reason it earns no perfect score - indeed, I almost rated it with an -, but because the previous arcs were so great, a - should be fair.

Caramba this show truly pissed me off. I love slash, femmeslash, yaoi and yuri it if done well like in ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" but here? This is just bad. I really wanted to like this show but I gave up after watching five episodes and here is why. This is not a story about love but sexual assault. Both girls either assault or are being assaulted by someone else (a teacher, a ""best friend""). There isn't a single instance where any of the sex doesn't look like dub-con or flat-out rape (what Himeko does to Mei - that was rape. Mei didn't enjoy any of it and was completely messed up after it). There is certainly no love anywhere. There is also no real story and not a single character that one can feel sympathetic for. Also, serious plot holes that make no sense. How the hell did the parents of those two girls end up married in the first place when Mei's father is constantly anywhere but in Japan? Did he advertise somewhere - ""need a mother for my teenage daughter, since I can't be arsed to take care of her myself""? This anime reminded me of ""Kuzu no Honkai"" which I tried reading but gave up after being utterly disgusted by all the characters. Every single character is an egoist and not caring whether they hurt anyone else in the process of trying to find pleasure/fulfilment. How can you sympathize with anyone when everyone is an a**hole.  I watch anime for enjoyment and there was neither joy nor enjoyment while watching this turd.

If Chobits was -- or -- episodes, it would have been better. 
After watching the first episode, I thought I was walking into something special. A catchy OP song, an interesting premise, and cute girl. But the novelty wore off by the --th or --th episode, which is why I believe it should have been shorter. 
Firstly, the art. It has not aged well. It's clear that it's the anime style of an era gone by. 
The sound was alright. I love the OP song, ""Let Me Be With You."" I'm definitely going to add it to my music library, but everything else didn't stand out at all. 
The strongest part of the show was the characters. I was afraid that the cast of characters would get too big, but Chobits hit just the right number of members to be able to go in-depth with the important ones (It better! Chobits was -- episodes, after all). There were some characters that I had pegged as minor characters or one-dimensional, but it was great that we got to learn more about them. This was key to Chobits, because people's relationships with Persocoms is the one of the major themes of the show. 
Which brings me to the story... I felt that all of the serious plot points of the story were super contrived. They should have decided whether Chobits should be mainly light-hearted or serious. The mix of the two was jarring for me, and I felt that the show's main strength was the romance, not the non-romance related drama. Also, I could have gone without watching all of the filler episodes. By episode -, I remember asking myself if I should really continue watching. 
I find the future of AI fascinating, and Chobits' philosophical debate about AI and humans interacting was what kept me watching. The premise of the story is good, but the drama that was injected fell flat for me. The characters interacting and their feelings for each other was heart-felt, even if there were a handful of filler episodes that did nothing for me. 
A weak story propped up on crutches by interesting points of view from the characters about the idea of AIs leaves Chobits with a -.

I had the feeling that this was just another Wash/Rinse/Dry(REPEAT) of Infinite Stratos. I couldn't connect to the characters since their backgrounds are vague at best. The semi-cg monsters are rather....poor, like a -- year old made them up and said to their parent ""Look, its a dragon"". The story line could have used a little more work. They overused Norse Mythology AGAIN, when they could have gone with something else, like oh say.....NOT Norse? The harem aspect is pretty much a given if the main char gets a full nude visual in the first episode, and that makes one think 'oh hey, this guy is SO gonna see them all naked.'.....not. The overall overuse of the ""Only man in the world can do this"" got tiring, since there around......lots of animes like that. Calling the dragon power users D's like they all love being called a letter all the time? seriously? at least use something original like D-Slayers....oh, that's not original. Overpowering the only male 'D' just makes it REALLY boring to watch, as with the lack of actual story development, they could have instead of saying ""This is our prey"" they could have just did like several other animes did and have random sprouts of enemies. The denseness of the main character is about skin deep, meaning he knows who likes him, but just doesn't care. His 'exchange' (memories for power) is a bit disconcerting if you think about it, what if he forgets he has the contract? What if he forgets his name, sister, raison d'etra? seriously, i could so see it, he pulls out the massive cannon thing and forgets why, then everyone dies because his price is forgetting things....LOOPHOLES ARE EVERYWHERE. I hope the writers of the anime adaptation read this and take into consideration that they don't need to give a life story for all the chars, but SOME background on them as well as closing the numerous loopholes and giving the 'Dragons' more of a dragonoid shape, otherwise changing their name to Dark Matter Clusters(DMC for short) and the humans with powers Dark Manipulators, or DMs. I read the description, did a little research before watching it, was all hyped up to see it, and disappointed when I made it to episode -, I finished it because I hate leaving things unfinished, was facepalming with a hammer by the end.

Sad but happy with this anime. While the plot wasn't exactly original *cough cough Big Windup! cough cough* at least it was entertaining.  
Introduction had a nice touch, referencing character mind set by providing a mini background story. Even with setting/ characters changing in one episode. Without this information view point i don't think the audience would appreciate the struggle the main characters had. Thus depriving an emotional connect. 
As for opening/closing credits they did a great job. I get shows can be lengthy in episodes but they shouldn't be the same thing over and over. Otherwise people will be skipping threw them unless the songs are catchy. Each element you can think of from song choice to art work was changed at some point. Heck depending on what episode you watched you received an occasion small Easter egg of additional content. If that wasn't wonderful each episode had previews to the ones that followed. I understand that isn't an original concept but here me out. Recall me referencing change ups to prevent routine consistency. Let's just say while the same recap information is there from one episode to the following in change over. Art provides somewhat additional content by change in words and perspective in some cases. 
Character background was fully explanatory. Each reason you could think of for a character's feeling on a matter was explained and referenced back to on occasion. So, not only could one get in the mind of all characters including main but one could be reminded in case they forgot. 
Plot while not original did instill great teamwork strategies even if they were not as hands on like Big Windup!. Thus presented useful tools for daily progression in a positive fashion. 
Conclusion i am at peace with despite feeling slightly disappointed. Yes, it could have easy taken the route one would have wanted it to but not only would that be some what unrealistic given the plot; but cliche as well. I also liked how they made it clear that there was a follow up season. 
One aspect i didn't like was episode coverage length. I understand with games each simple action has a long impact. And the longer the game the longer the time will feel but why does the audience need to suffer?

Intro: Although it is not the smart thing to do, this will be a review for the entire Initial D series (First stage, Second Stage, Third Stage, Fourth Stage, Fifth Stage and Final Stage). 
Story: -/--  
Although at first the story may seem boring or not appealing it actuallty is great and dosen't get too repetitive but towards the final seasons the story is getting less real.  
The story takes place in about a - year interval and revolves around the journey of a ditsy highschooler (Takumi) who will join his friend's race team and become one of the fastest street racers in his area, later being recruited by the great team ""Project D"" and in the end becoming a profesional racer. 
The writer seems to enjoy creating relationship only to later destroy them, thing that can bother some viewers. 
The story is fast paced, engaging and reality-like but it does have it's flaws. 
Some of the things I did not like or flaws I found: 
-. It is ---- but they seem to forget they have phones and that certain characters exchanged phone numbers. (Iketani and Mako in First Stage) 
-. Mogi at the age of about -- years old has inappropriate relations (sex) with an older man she calls ""papa"" in exchange for money, clothes or other benefits. Mogi is engaging in Enjo Kosai, prostitution if I may call it that.(explained in First Stage, Second Stage, third Stage) 
-. This show creates relationships and then brutally kills them, only resulting in wasted screen time. Since I am not an emotional person I don't care but many other viewers were bothered by it. 
-. There are no cops, not even once. 
-. It is annoying how some of these good friends betray each other. Ex: In first stage Iketani threw Takumi under the buss by setting up a race just to please Mako. 
-. At times the story gets repetitive. 
-. Even though the story happens in - year's interval, in Stage -(----) they have huge old computers and old style mobile phones but in Stage -(----) they have new laptops and smartphones. Has techonlogy improved that much in - year? 
-. Certain facts are exagerated, but I guess it's ok since it is an anime series. 
-. In the Fifth Stage and Final Stage the races got a lot more dull, with way more talking and way less racing. 
--. Where are Mogi's parents? They are never shown or talked about. 
--. In final stage it is explained that Takumi's -- (the hatchback) is slower than Shinji's -- (the coupe) because of the car geometry/structure. But the hatchback's -rd door would only make it slightly slower but for plot purposes, that ""slightly slower"" is very exagerated. Takumi is way, way slower in corners because he is driving a hatchback. Give me a break! 
--. The Final Stage was not vey exciting and dragged on for too long. 
--. In Fifth Stage and Final Stage the OST was not as good as in the previous seasons. 
--. The character design changes form one season to another. 
Characters: -/-- 
The characters have various diffrent personalities and are developed over the course of the series, each character has something unique about them. 
Takumi, the main character, is likeable and a good protagonist, he is well characterized and gets more than enough development.  
In the beginning Takumi is an emotionless guy who is driving out of necessity and during the series he becomes a lot more emotional and is driving out of pleasure. He starts as a good driver and develops into a ""monster"" that outclasses everyone, a genius in the making, he is better than most of the drivers he races and yet during many races he struggles to win, which makes the series more real. 
Bunta is Takumi's father, he is one bad ass dude. I wish there were some OVAs showing his past as a street racer. 
Itsuki is Takumi's best friend, he introduced Takumi to street racing. Itsuki always has hope in Takumi's skills as a racer and does his best to help his friend, even though he does not know much about racing. 
Iketani is one of Takumi's friends, he helps the protagonist with mechanical and other issues and is always happy to help. Iketani played a big part in Takumi's debut as a street racer. 
Inui Shinji, this Final Stage downhill expert that is in highschool is just a ""made in china"" poor copy of Takumi, having no other reason for wanting to race than the juvenile attempt of trying to get the attention of girls he knows are out of his league(ex:Mako). The fact that he does not quietly leave for his race, instead stoping, showing off and making sure the girls(Mako and her friend) know he is the opponent of Fujiwara lacks any charisma and only comes out as despicable compared to Fujiwara's behavior. 
He started driving in upper elementary school, about - years before Takumi started driving. Are you serious? Next thing we'll see is a new born baby in a R-- rocking the road. 
Natsuki Mogi used to be a prostitute and Takumi's girlfriend for a period of time, her purpose is to show the ""real"" Japan. 
I personally liked Mogi's character and think she is one of the most developed characters in the series. There is a lot of hate aimed towards her character and I can understand why.  
- Mogi did not have any morals, self-respect or sense of shame until she met Takumi and decided to change. We do not know anything about her past/family, she may have reasons for ending up the way she did. 
- Mogi used to be a young prostitute and a slut, at the age of -- she was having sex with an older man in exchange for money while she was having sex and doing who knows what with an upperclassman. Long story short: she was not a respectable woman or someone you would want to be envolved with. 
- Mogi was a prostitute until she decided to be Takumi's girlfriend. Out of love for him she stopped seeing the older man and ceased any other ""odd"" activities, deciding to be a good person. Unfortunately someone left Takumi a note, revealing her past and causing their break-up. (in the manga, the person that left the note was the older man's daughter and a friend of Mogi). 
- Her relationship with Takumi eneded because she was not honest and did not tell Takumi about her past nor did she stop her ""meetings"" the moment she decided to become Takumi's girlfriend. I will give her credit, she did stop seeing the older man but it was too late.  
- I did not like the following contradiction: Mogi stated in the first episode that she hates ""people who smoke and people who break their promises"" and later when she was confessing her sins to Takumi in Third Stage she stated she liked the older man, who was a smoker. How does that work? 
Japanese girls these days can easily fall in the trap of ""Enjo Kosai"" or prostitution like Mogi did. Girls these days want the money but not the honest work to make them, especially in the contemporan society where people don't have as much sense of shame as before.  
Mogi kept oscilationg between making me pitty her and being a nuisance for wasting screen time. 
Animation: -/-- 
Even though the animation differs between seasons, I personally enjoyed the animation and art, especially in the street races the CG was well put to work. The animation is mostly fluid and the art is nice but the character design changes too much between seasons. 
Sound: -/-- 
All the opening and ending themes were good as well as both the english(funimation) and japanese voice actors.  
What I really enjoyed was the surpisingly good background music that cointained various diffrent songs, the OST does an outstanding job. 
Enjoyment: -/--  
This anime got me hyped up and gave me goosebumps, action with just enough romance and comedy mixed in to create a great series. 
Overall: -.-/-- 
A great anime series that started great and ended not so great. 
I paricularly am interested in cars but I think anyone would enjoy this show. I would recommend Initial D to anyone.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Owarimonogatari was ultimately the end of the first, and most likely the main story of the series. These last three arcs provided a good conclusion and I wouldn't be upset if that's the final Monogatari-related product adapted by SHAFT. Although I doubt it, since there are tens of side-stories, epilogues, prologues and everything in-between left to adapt. This, however, felt like a proper conclusion. Even if it wasn't what I wanted, I can't help but feel happy about the ending regardless.  
Monogatari, ever since I began watching it, always left me with an air of ambivalence. If you go venture forth to the past and dig through to find one of my earliest reviews on this website, one of Bakemonogatari, you'd see exactly that. Me struggling endlessly with coming to terms with my feelings about the series. It left me feeling sleazy and gross, but compelled and intrigued. I initially described it as the guiltiest possible pleasure and while my opinions may have changed with my tastes, I think that outlines the overall complexity of emotions I felt towards the product. On one hand the presentation is outstanding and unique, hearkening back and taking from the French New Wave, but what its presenting is often perverse and over-indulgent. The main narrative is fractured and presented in a spectacularly interesting fashion with the unreliable narrator quirk, but is often sidelined for pandering sexuality. The characters are multi-faceted and endlessly dynamic, but aren't often presented as such. It is an enigma, truly.  
While my opinions have changed and my appreciation for this series continuously grows, due to the amount of inspiration it has given me as a creative, this idea of conflicting feelings still remains the same. Even throughout this end-story. I get a conclusion, and the conclusion is quite good with just about every story wrapping up in a feel-good bundle of catharsis. It is still something that I wasn't expecting nor really wanting from this show. I was expecting something darker, something more somber, something with pain and eventual sacrifice and I was expecting the specialists to play significantly bigger role in the story after their buildup through Owarimonogatari's first season as well as the awe-inspiring conclusion to Koyomimonogatari.  
Maybe my expectations weren't deserved and built completely upon my own desires for the series, but that feels redundant to say as that's pretty much defining expectations for anything. Owarimonogatari's second season and conclusion does have problems, however, it is packaged and delivered so well that they don't feel like problems as much as they feel like additions that I may disagree with. Maybe that's why i'm so happy to accept this conclusion even if it harshly isn't what I wanted or expected, that's my mea culpa.

[Presentation]  
Before we delve deep into the semi-spoiler conversation, I think it is safe to say that this series is the best presented television anime. While it may not be as beautifully animated as something from Kyoto Animation or as viciously energetic as a Trigger production, it is a SHAFT product through and through. Harsh yet understated, with pronounced colors and a focus on bringing the most from dialogue heavy scenes.  
The coloring in these episodes is as good as ever, with beautiful shot-composition mixed in with spectacular changes in art-style in the first arc of this series. The other two were equally beautiful, with harsh changes of color and space, presenting even the goofiest character moments as if it is high-art strung up in a gallery.  
The violent, stinging violins in the climactic soundtrack continuously impress. While most people may point to the admittedly catchy opening themes of this series as examples of its musical prowess, I can't help but point to what I find more impressive. The memorable backing tracks to the shows most climactic moments. From the badass theme at the end of Nisemonogatari, where specialist Kagenui flexes her muscles in a scene so brutally cathartic that it is one of my all-time favorite anime moments. To the plucking strings and winding synths of the shows most surprising scenes, when Gaen reveals her vampire-slaying sword and chops our protagonist into a thousand pieces. The music here is as wonderful as ever.  
Monogatari has never been the most animated series, and for good reason. Much like most TV-anime it is a rushed product on a deadline. However, SHAFT make even the most still scenes feel alive and vibrant with the setting and shot composition, and as always the direction here is astounding.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[Story and Resolution]  
Presented in three arcs, the final moments with these characters and their eventual graduation feel spur-of-the-moment. The show, for the first time ever, feels as though it has a distinct narrative purpose. Since it has one goal, to end its main story, it never decides to linger on moments that are otherwise unimportant to the series narrative. Even the second episode, the extended date between Senjougahara and Araragi feels as though it plays a direct part in the climax, Araragi's waning adolescence, Ougi's mysterious plot, and the growth between these two from a relationship standpoint.  
However, before we delve into that, we have the first story. Between Araragi, Hachikuji, and the involved Tadatsuru, which delivers something visually astounding and narratively intriguing, yet creates a few worries that may find themselves wriggling into the shows core climax.   
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[Mayoi Hell]  
Obvious spoilers. Hachikuji is back and she's in hell. Some pretty funny reasoning is provided for that. More importantly, SHAFT gets to flex its visual style to the fullest here, providing one of the most visually impressive arcs since the gorgeous Tsukimonogatari. As Araragi ventures through hell, and to a certain extent, his past, he discovers how to return and what the reasoning behind his murder was. An elaborate plan by Gaen to return his humanity.  
Good stuff. Even if Hachikuji's return wasn't all that interesting to me. Especially since we have already said our goodbyes to that character and coming back after a pretty good send-off feels as though i'm holding in a sneeze. Unrewarding and kind of painful. I like Hachikuji, she's quirky and engaging with a pretty great catchphrase that gets probably the best payoff of any joke in the series. However, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in her return as an establishment of norms and the lack of consequences. It robbed the series of some weight. More on her later.  
They meet with Tadatsuru and in beloved Monogatari fashion we get a gloriously long exposition sequence full of fascinating insights by this really intriguing character, as well as a quick look at the network of specialists that Gaen has established as being the backbone for oddity-hunting. Tadatsuru's powers are great and paint a understandable picture of Ononoki's creation, even if we lack the insight of her ""big sister"", Kagenui, more on her later.  
Araragi is sent off with Hachikuji captured in his legs and brings her into the real world. Initially I had even more of an objection to this, as it totally undermined her exit even further. If it is so easy to leave hell, what is even the point of it? However, that gets amended further on in the series. The introductory arc here really set the tone for the show. It was lean-mean, and without filler, which was great.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[Hitagi Rendezvous]  
Before I even talk about the date, I want to express how deeply upsetting it was to see Kagenui's character and her potentially incredible importance to the series being brushed off. It undermined the entirety of her disappearance in Koyomimonogatari as well as never quite explaining how Ougi got anyone to leave. It felt like an underhanded and obnoxiously pandering way to just keep Ononoki around the harem, which honestly doesn't fucking matter to me. Ononoki is pretty much useless right now, she is literally a doll and since Kagenui isn't around, has virtually no power. She is there to provide a few sparring dialogue driven moments and her inclusion in this arc felt completely unnecessary as she virtually did nothing.  
If they kept Kagenui relevant to the story and didn't chuck her to the side for literally no convincing reason, Ononoki and Kagenui could've been back to actually matter and provide some interesting insight to spar with Gaen's own bias arguments against Ougi. Yet nothing like that happened. She's gone, and the reasoning given was that she was practicing ""Martial arts"" at what was later revealed to be the North Pole. Why? Why would she be doing that? Isn't she an immortal oddity specialist? Isn't her goal and job to exterminate immortal oddities? Isn't Shinobu back in her full-form? Isn't that Ougi? Kagenui expressed no fear in fighting Shinobu with her powers back in Nise, so it makes no sense for her to leave now. Way to completely under-utilize a dynamic and potentially interesting character. What a farce. This was probably the most upsetting moment about this three-parter and probably the only reason I had to take a point off.  
Especially since the date between Araragi and Senjougahara was wonderful. I always felt as though their relationship was a bit tepid. They said they damn-near love each other yet Araragi runs around fucking with plenty of other girls. It really doesn't make any sense and makes the entire relationship feel phony, especially since Senjougahara got almost no screen-time recently. Her return is welcome. She is the most dynamic and fascinating of the harem-girls and definitely proved that here. Her character growth since the first arc in Bakemonogatari is palpable and honestly very endearing. Her various little idiosyncrasies really paint an engaging portrait of her character.  
The resolution to their date is endlessly lovable and actually helps create a more believable relationship between the two, even if I still object to Araragi's lascivious and scummy behavior otherwise. I really enjoyed this, and I didn't find that it meandered or lacked any meaning. It was well-placed in the middle of these other two, more serious arcs.  
What i'd be remiss not to discuss is the dream sequence with Ougi, which is not only a spectacular insight on her character but also plays as a wonderful hint at who she really is. Everything from her saying being a riff on Gaen and Hanekawa to her knowledge of the star-systems being Araragi's own knowledge, the pieces of the puzzle were finally falling into place and this fractured narrative was finally become clear. At this point, in my eyes, it was clear with who Ougi was, even if I wasn't sure what role she exactly played.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[Ougi Dark] 
To refer back to my initial thesis, this arc's progress and climax wasn't something I was expecting or wanting, but a great part about growing up is being able to look at something as a whole and really determining whether that is a bad thing. I think the more I look back on this arc the more I'll come to enjoy and appreciate that it did something that I wasn't expecting nor wanting, but still managed to be entertaining and pretty damn impressive, narratively.  
My fear that the specialists would ultimately play a small role in the climax was unfortunately confirmed, as Gaen dumped some exposition and moved on. This and Shinobu's ultimate uselessness in her hyper-powerful form needs to be accepted as a narrative loop rather than a flaw, in my opinion. Because of course Araragi will ultimately have to face this issue on his own. It is, after all, always been his issue and no one else's. The narrative here had me hurdling through various flaming hoops of acceptance while also trying to follow along to the somewhat complicated explanations for everything. Needless to say, it was a gripping experience none-the-less. 
What particularly impressed me apart from Ougi's true reveal was the use for Hachikuji who's inclusion I have previously expressed my distaste with. Gaen's proposed solution was actually quite clever and made sense within the grand scheme of the story and provided the best use of Hachikuji's signature 'I stuttered"" catchphrase. It was great. I went from disliking her inclusion to totally buying it, which speaks volumes to how well this entire aspect of the narrative was delivered.  
Onward to Ougi's true reveal. I say ""true"" because her being Araragi's oddity didn't come as much of a surprise, of course she was. Especially the opening to this final arc solidifying that. What was more interesting a reveal was her role as Araragi's oddity, manifesting as adolescence. This actually paints a unique picture of Araragi's character and growth throughout the series.  
I'm no stranger to criticizing our boy Koyomi here, since I think he's kind of a scumbag, however, the portrait of his adolescence was poignant none-the-less. This somewhat esoteric conclusion helped me understand the rest of this series' motivations as well as his character progression overall. What could've been myopic ended up being quite engaging, even Araragi's rejection of his own change to saving Ougi, which I was initially against but over the course of the past few hours warmed up to. Because of course he'd save her, he's Araragi.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
[The Moral of the Story] 
And now for the epilogue, or rather, the punchline. What Monogatari does so well is provide an experience unlike anything else in anime. An industry and medium that indulges in pulpy entertainment has this series which indulges in the idea of indulging. Consuming everything that is inherently right or wrong with the industry and presenting it as if it is high-art. Taking ideas from the most influential, yet also the most cherry-picked movement in cinema, the French New Wave, and crafting a narrative that not only doesn't treat its audience like children, but goes out of its way to be esoteric and challenging. Very much in line with the New Wave, Monogatari has a kind of style and essence to it that separates it from anything else in the medium. Especially since at its core it has these sleazy elements to it.  
Relating back to the initial point of contention, my dissonance with this series manifesting as a love and appreciation for it. These last three arcs, ones which lack the fanservice that some of the other parts of the series indulge in, are some of the most solid parts of the series, up there with the flawless masterpiece which is Hitagi End, my favorite thing I've ever seen from this televised medium. It proves to me that this show could've been better without its over-indulgent obsession with childish sexuality and pandering which often took up big parts of other episodes in other arcs, however, is that really true? I undoubtedly didn't, and don't, enjoy those elements, yet they are inherent in Monogatari being Monogatari. Without them this wouldn't be Monogatari, and the lack of them in these final arcs proves to me how big of contrast there is, which helped elevate the stakes and create tension which otherwise wouldn't have been escalated if the entire series was devoid of these elements. 
I feel like I always wanted Monogatari to be more mature than it was, however, once again, maybe that was wishful thinking. Much like Araragi says as the final line in these arcs, he is himself, and this series is itself. And expecting it to be something different when it so well-established exactly what it is makes no sense, logistically. Because much like Araragi, Monogatari experienced an odd kind of growth as well, where the maturity may not have increased but a realization did happen. The self-awareness here is palpable and as with any product that has displayed a knack for multi-faceted storytelling, I don't think it is out-of-line to analyze this series so extensively.  
During Ougi Dark, there is a scene where the characters dissect Ougi's formation as a cake. Each character representing a slice. Which honestly feels like this show being self-aware about its own indulgence, both having the cake and eating it to, which is an element I've been bringing up in reviews since their conception. The cake here being Araragi's division and eventual realization of purpose, while also doubling as context for this shows harem elements. Which I wouldn't say is as much of an excuse as it is a justification, and a good one at that.  
Its harem elements were never the strongest parts of the series, and being myself I'd go so far as to say they were the weakest parts. However, they, in the end, felt necessary to this show having the conclusion it did. For me, the strongest parts were always the main narrative and the specialists, who were characters that were infinitely more fascinating than the main group and harbored more interesting traits and purposes, but as I've already said, it wasn't their story and I shouldn't have been expecting them to play a huge role here. My own, negative idiosyncrasy.  
In the end, this series which still confuses me emotionally provided an exceptional conclusion to its first and most likely main story, as it wrapped up its final arcs in an acceptable and thoroughly understandable way. At its most basic, the story of adolescence and accepting that adolescence permeates through the entirety of this series. Because if we were to fully strip it down, the punchline is that there is no need to let go of that. Much like Araragi isn't willing to let go of his own, even while saying that his adolescence has left him he acknowledges that he isn't fully an adult to Hanekawa. And I don't think that is really the point of this experience. It isn't much of a coming of age story. At the climax, he doesn't let go of the oddity manifesting as his own adolescence and that's the final realization. But I don't know. 
But who knows, really? A series like this is so esoteric that even its most well-defined moments can be read into as something else and that's exactly what I appreciate about it. It proves itself worthy of being analyzed, as any great piece of art should. As I said in my very first venture into Monogatari, I only know what I know.

So found out that world trigger was completed then i started to watch it and frankly for someone who likes these types of anime this anime both triggered and dissapointed me big time. Why almost everyone think this is great praising it like the next coming well no its not.  
The story is the same as most anime there you have scifi combined with superlike human weapons or abilities. Good guys fight back while bad guys keep invading. This is fine i kinda expected it and its not something i would rate an anime bad for. The only  problem is that type of story makes it easy to guess different plots in it. When i see something happening and think to myself ah so it was going to happen like that, then i know something just normal will be with this anime. The triggers is what make this anime what it is it gives the anime the only  thing to make it unique. What type of triggers does he use what is the difference between each things like that is of interest because thats what this anime is about combined with the alien attack. But this anime pisses me of because i feel like they just say hey lets make this happen while another part says hey lets stop this doesnt feel good lets make something else happen instead. And when they finally get to explain things they create a big event and its basically and now after the invation break. I can watch slow animes i even love those but thats when they actually try to get some sort of picture through or explain not when you just throw a bunch of fights there you just get more and more distraught.  
I will give this anime that it has openings that you can enjoy eventhough they try to make the anime unique by plopping the openings in the middle of the episode. The openings are interesting there is that.  
Never have i  found myself hate as many characters as i did in this anime never. I was at the -- episode when i thought should i just toss it aside but no my anime sence told me that there was something i would enjoy. The characters was not any of this. The main character is piss poor weak he cant fight for shit he cant even do dmg whats so great about this. He gets helped almost always and it feels like the only thing he can do is acting like a meat shield or run away as a distraction. The main supporting girl Chika basically gave alot of the story away when i heard about her more clearly which is why i wont spoil it but its obvious. The supporting guy Yuma is your typical op supporting character who helps the main character Osuma a bunch of times hes likable enough but has his weird yet kind side. There are a few other characters i could like but too many gave me that feeling of annoyance and wanted to throw off a cliff 
I started to enjoy this anime when i got to about episode -- surprise ? well you shouldnt be. I had to fight my way through episodes there i wonder is there any point in this anime having a Mc. My advice for whoever reads this is to not care about main character and just view everything as a story of its own and never think of any character as a main just think of them as part of a divition or similar to that or you will run the risk of being burned.  
Overall there is nothing special about this anime that i could say i enjoyed all the way through i can only say that it had its good moment but thats it. The story and the consept of the triggers was great but in the end i could find an anime like this and find a better one easly. If i ever watch this one again it will be from around episode -- or so maybe -- but not much back than that.

This is a purely enjoyment show full of violence and naked baby. 
""This is a story of a delinquent high school student who ended up having to raise a baby due to unexpected occurances, but this isn't just any baby, it's the Demon King."" 
That is what you'll hear at the beginning of each episode. It is a constant reminder of what the show is about... as if we'd forget. The show is pretty random throughout, but the show does carry an underlying plot, so not everything is random. And by random, I mean each episode has some kind of different aspect that needs to be learned in order to raise a Demon King. Anyway, when the baby isn't being focused on, the story mainly involves a lot of violence and sometimes... comedy. Mind you, I haven't found myself laughing very much. 
The art is pretty good, however, a constantly naked baby, isn't really my thing. The art style changes from time to time to show suspense and anger, but overall the art was consistent and detailed. The backgrounds were more detailed than most anime shows I've seen, so that was refreshing. However, the artists reused some scenes a few times which really didn't sit well with me. But overall, the art was good. 
Same for the sound, the sound wasn't fantastic or genre-defining, but there wasn't anything too annoying, other than the constant yelling and screaming. 
There really hasn't been much character development yet. Everything seems a bit bland and when a character can get depth, the show goes back to attempt some comedy rather than giving a serious moment of character development. This show so far... hasn't been all that interesting to me, but I am still watching it and hoping that a little romance will develop.. but it seems that hell will have to freeze over before anything serious is introduced. (Sorry for the very bad pun, and no I'm not proud of that sentence.). 
Like I wrote before, this is mainly a show about mindless enjoyment, which is something that is needed every once in a while.

For a filler-ish shounen movie it holds up well enough story wise. Not too unique or twisting in terms of story but it gets the job done. 
Art - -/-- 
It doesn't look bad per say, but it arguably looks worse than the show and uses some effects that the show doesn't that kinda stand out, in a bad way. 
Sound - -/-- 
MHA has a good soundtrack, difficult to mess this up, however the music seems crammed in at points, almost as if they kinda wanted to put in every OST just for the sake of it, which does detract. 
Character - -/-- 
The characters from the show/manga act mostly like themselves. And the new characters are not bad, though they are not exactly compelling either. Not much to say. 
Enjoyement - -/-- 
Besides the first ~----- which had some recap, probably because they wanted the movie to be somewhat accessible to people who hadn't seen the show (though I don't know why people who doesn't watch it would like to see the movie), it was a good time. Never did I feel like checking the remaining time of the movie or like I wanted to stop watching, but I also never felt super compelled. 
Overall - -/-- 
It's worth watching. I don't know if I'd ever buy it as a Blue-Ray or DVD, well actually I know I wouldn't, however with nothing better to do and a streaming service you might as well.

Kuroshitsuji does Zombie Invasion on a Boat?... 
Well before LA tackles the movie itself, the Kuroshitsuji series has been a somewhat nostalgic favourite of LA's, from the first season hooking LA in very quickly with it's characters, settings and badassery to Book of Circus delving more into Ciel's past while at the same time giving us some rather sympathetic villains in the process while bringing us more into Kuroshitsuji's world lore at the same time. What?..what second season?...LA has never heard of a second season of Kuroshitsuji before...and finally we continue with Book of Atlantic. 
The Book of Atlantic is just like any of the ""Books"" of Kuroshitsuji, isolated incidents that lure Ciel in due to his status as the Queen's watchdog and along the way we get more world building and more into Ciel's past once again, only this time Book fo Atlantic goes into some developments of some rather minor characters LA wasn't expecting in this movie. 
Some mild spoilers, you have been warned. 
So Book of Atlantic takes place is what is essentially a zombie invasion on a boat but seriously that is the LEAST of this movie's highlights, however for what the movie's and by it's major villain's ambitions does makes sense into the plot at least, what with the villain's fascination with death. Nonetheless the zombie outbreak is the setting for the movie, so what are the highlights of this movie, well it's two or three characters that utterly steal the spotlight from the movie, those being Elizabeth Midford, Undertaker and hey Sebastian gets some character development here too. 
Let's start with Elizabeth, she's the regal moe fiancee of Ciel of the series and from the first season alone, she was nothing but comic relief, however we see from this movie that she's a rather sword hiding under the silk in terms of her backstory and how BADASS she REALLY is by the end of it. Book of Atlantic also pretty much shows that Ciel is now actually personally smitten after Elizabeth shows her true self to Ciel...too bad her screentime then gets stolen by... 
UNDERTAKER, yeah, so you know the major villain of this whole movie, yeah it's him who was ALSO another minor comic relief character in the series and he too finally gets to show his true self, that of a Fallen Shinigami being fascinated by humans and death and yes he is the mastermind behind the entire movie essentially with having the red herring of Doctor Ryan Stoker being the catalyst to it all and creating the zombies in the first place. Due to this both Sebastian and the Shinigami's of Grell (Yeah...he's back) and Ronald Knoxx wants him dead or alive as Undertaker essentially screwed with Ciel and Sebastian and caused a massive backlog confusion with the Shinigami's, so both parties goes after him. 
And finally, Sebastian essentially gets his backstory of what happened before the first season and his goals of being the Phantomhive butler in the first place (which fans of the anime already knows), to this as much as looking into the backstory of how Sebastian became Ciel's butler as well as both of them learning from their mistakes in order to become the duo they are, Sebastian's backstory comes well not out of nowhere, more like is backstory takes TOO long and the forgone conclusion of Sebastian wanting Ciel's soul matured and delicious is something we already know...LA doesn't know that part felt like partial filler to LA, but whatever. 
In terms of animation done once again by A--Pictures, the character designs are expected quality even for movie standards as well as the period this movie is placed in (the ----'s), LA did have some problems with the CGI zombies but since the zombies are somewhat suppose to be these shambling corpse of what was once humans, LA thinks LA can let the CGI quality slide in this movie. The action scenes are gory, bloody and all round a gore fest what with the zombies anyways but nonetheless the animation by the by was decent enough even if there are a few CGI problems here and there. 
In terms of voice acting, this is an impressive voice cast, what the reprisal of many of the anime series voice cast, Maaya Sakamoto once again crossdressing voices as Ciel again and Daisuke Ono as Sebastian, YUKARI TAMURA as Elizabeth was amazing as always and heck LA didn't know the Major and Kirei Kotomine had a daughter...YUP Atsuko Tanaka and Joji Nakata gets some voice cameo's as Elizabeth's mother and father!. LA wanted to put Yukari Tamura as LA's MVP however due the circumstances of TWO characters stealing the movie away from her, LA would put both Juniche Sawabe and Jun Fukuyama (as Undertaker and Grell respectively) as LA's MVP's in terms of voice cast. 
The Book of Atlantic is another of Ciel's isolated adventures, however has actually less to do with Ciel this time and has more to do with the minor characters getting the spotlight what with Elizabeth and Undertaker and everything. Book of Atlantic tries to weave something about the human condition be it the living or dead and tries to pit the one another, however due to our major villain Undertaker's curiosity and him retreating in the aftermath, LA is kinda mixed about what Ciel learned from all this?, is it don't look at just surface level of things otherwise you'll regret it, or is it that death is imminent no matter what?...well at least the entire ""surface level"" thing is accurate towards Elizabeth and Undertaker, but the death subject fled with Undertaker himself. 
Well introspection of the Book fo Atlantic aside, the Book of Atlantic is another romp of the Queen's watchdog and his butler with supernatural elements this time coming from zombies and Shinigami's and demons going all at it on a freakin' boat. If your a fan of Kuroshitsuji it's obvious to watch this movie if not for character developments you weren't expecting or just showing that some characters you thought you knew are something completely different, more world building or if your just here to see what Ciel and Sebastian is up to this time. 
*Note - LA forgot to watch Book of Murder before watching Atlantic, just if your wondering why Murder wasn't mentioned.

A calm episode without zombies in wich HotD crew spends a day on the small island's beach. Ecchi and humorous. 
But it's not even worth mentioning. It's not very funny and it's not very hot. 
The story doesn't evolve in it in any way nor the relations between characters. It's pure and silly ecchi breast action involving all female main characters halucinating, but it's not even interesting. 
The only reason I could think of that somebody could watch this OVA is for seeing Miss Shizuka's nipples. :] Fortunately it's short and there's only one episode so I didn't have to watch more of this kind of OVA's to check if the story will evolve in any way.

NOTE: This is a review of the dub (which is an important distinction to make) 
Overall - -: 
The dub of ghost stories is an officially licensed abridge series, and as far as abridge series go it's honestly not that great. 
A particular episode might be great, and another might not be. Also because it's officially licensed you won't have some of the things seen in other abridged series (like adding in pictures or big plot changes). 
Story - -: 
I'm counting the humor to be part of this, otherwise this would be a lot lower. 
The Story is simple and episodic, and very predictable. It honestly sucks. The humor on the other hand is the draw of the anime. Not all the jokes are great, they name drop far too many celebrities, but some of the jokes really nail it. I'm particularly fond of the rabbit episode. 
Art - -: 
The art and effects are bad and look very aged, but that doesn't matter a whole lot when it come to the enjoyment of it. 
Sound - -: 
The OST sucks and the quality of the sound effects and some of the characters is pretty bad (not sure I saw it in the highest quality possible). This doesn't take away from the enjoyment too much because you can hear what people are saying and the sound effects get the point across. 
Character - -: 
The cat was annoying, and it was frustration how almost every episode had the characters forgetting about some obvious solution to their problems (the book). 
The way the characters were handled worked quite well. It brought some interesting dynamics to the humor. 
Enjoyment - -: 
Some parts had me laughing, even in the worst episodes there was always a line or two that worked. Like I said before it's not the best, but I did enjoy it enough to warrant a -.

Judging from what the plot itself sounds like, a lot of people have thought of this anime as an extremely hardcore horror or something similar to that. Let me tell you that it is not extreme hardcore horror and things like that. If I were to rate how horror-ish this anime is, it would be around a - or - out of --. This is more of a tragedy anime. 
The anime does have bloody and gory moments but most of the sites have those parts as censored, so if you want to watch all the arm/leg tearing, slicing, and so on action, then watch the dvd. I will NOT recommend this to those who have stomach turning moments or something similar to that to those who cannot stand seeing or hearing the screaming from excessive pain and those types of ugly moments. 
Overall, the anime itself is great to watch with great plots and suspense, but in comparison to the manga, the manga is more detailed where the anime would obviously have a few parts cut out from the manga, so try not to be too disappointed when you dont see your favorite part or something, but it should be okay. The artwork is really beautiful and the character drawings are elegant in my perspective in comparison to the manga. For those who like tragic scenes and conflicts with really good art, I highly recommend this.

I found no problem with the movie at all, other than the melodramatic overstated mood they went with for the ending considering the natural and low-key presentation they used for most of the running time, although at least they left the science fiction concepts as a subtle wink and kept it as just a medium to the true story of character interaction. It&rsquo;s amazing how entertaining and delightful the overall product was, and with my words here I am doing no justice to the real feeling behind my statement but want to avoid needless hyperboles and keep this the more down-to-earth I can for now. Safely can be said that as a whole, be it for artistic attributes, good story telling or the really lovable protagonist and those charismatic personages surrounding her, this is seriously one of the most enjoyable films in recent years, animated or not. 
As a &ldquo;time-traveling&rdquo; tale the script does has it share of faults but even so I can&rsquo;t find any as idiotic as what we could already see in &ldquo;Back to the Future -&rdquo;, which even when finding itself in the middle of such paradoxes managed to keep itself a classic thanks to the fact that it can be resumed as juvenile yet somewhat meaningful fun from beginning to end, and by the finale the point of the plot wasn&rsquo;t really to develop the whole physical mechanics of moving in a temporal plane but rather how such an ability, in a metaphorical sense, affects the life of a young girl, who is by the way one of the most wonderfully done and likeable female teenagers in the medium. 
Interesting was also to see how the directorial maturity of Hosoda is much more firm now, the melancholic stylishness is still here but for some reason with a major focus when compared to his still brilliant Digimon movies. He remains both trendy and lyrical but perhaps now he turns out even more restrained and introspectively social than before, probably a reflection of the natural movement beyond Tai and his pubescent friends, or the Superflat Monogram girl, towards a state that borders adulthood. 
Besides Hosoda&rsquo;s firm commandment the other incredibly remarkable technical aspect was the graphical design, which turns up as pure urban magic achieved through visuals, a thoroughly endearing representation of youthfulness, with simplistic and amazingly humane movement that retains a cartoon-like expressiveness that helps it in going beyond the representation of reality and achieving much more aliveness through un-noticeable and at the same time deeply underlying exaggeration. The team went with a very modern interpretation of what &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; signifies and they did a brilliant job at that approach. 
As a whole TokiKake is as a film unpretentious and sincere, eradiating enchantment in every minute it is shown on the screen. Besides, even if you can&rsquo;t empathically sympathize with the characters you can&rsquo;t deny their charisma, the entirely believable naturality of the presence they represent as individuals. Go watch this now, at worse you'll be entertained.

I wasn't planning on writing a review for this series. The show is older and many valuable and to the point reviews have already been written. I started re-watching the series on the weekend and as usual when it ended I was left wishing for more. Then I checked recommendations on MyAnimeList and was directed to Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. I watched it. These two series are really not on the same wave length. Yes, in both the circumstances leave a male relative caring for the child/ren of another, and yes they both do grapple with changed lifestyle and added responsibilities. But really they are not alike. Let me put it to you this way. --Cent lost his mother when he was - and I lost mine when I was --. Now let me ask you this. Do you think I can rap like -- Cent? 
Story: 
Synopsis is very accurate. That said, Usagi Drop is one of the loveliest slice of life anime out there. Despite being only --,- episodes long, the story surprisingly manages to be deep and serious and yet maintains an uplifting attitude and humor at the same time. So much so that when you are watching the episodes you don't actually fully grasp the seriousness of the topic. The serious part sort of hits you in the gut, when the episode has ended and you are actually basking in the afterglow of the pleasant experience. And then you think back, and realize, the anime did not make light of the topic in question, but simply managed to present it, in an uplifting manner. (e.g. parental abandonment and it's effects, marital discord etc.) 
Art: 
It is nothing ""fancy"" like the style that seems to be the ""usual"" these days. (Please forgive the quotation marks. I just don't know how to describe them, I am not trying to be sarcastic or overbearing.)  
What I mean by that is, you won't find eyes sized half the face, ready to water up, or pouty lips that would make Angelina Jolie jealous, or hair that is glossy and shiny as if pearl dust has been spread over it. They look like normal people. And yet, Rin is exploding the cute-meter, Daikichi is adorable when he is slowly moving into his guardian mode and so on. In short, while it is not glossy, it is still very very fine.  
Audio: 
The seiyuus do an outstanding job. Considering this is a slice of life anime, if one of the characters sounds ""out of whack"" you are bound to go ""eeeek, what the heck was that, that type would never sound like that!"". But it never happens. Especially the kids. They never sound like ---something year-olds that are trying to sound childish, nor do they sound over the top childish. They simply sound like children should sound. I have to admit, I watched the anime for the -th or -th time this weekend, but not once did I pay much attention to the opening nor the ending song, or to any other song in between for that matter. So I can't say anything about that. 
Characters: 
The characters are great. No matter how short their role, they all get handled with TLC and get their depths. As for the main characters Rin and Daikichi, watching their development as persons as well as their interaction with others and with each other is all what this anime is about and it is a joy to follow. 
Enjoyment: 
I remember the first time I watched this anime. I was expecting something ""angst""y to happen any second. But it didn't. This anime tells its story without creating drama for drama's sake. There are moments, you laugh, there are moments, you dither, there are moments you get a little frustrated or agitated. It just simply takes you over the board of emotions without going over the board. It stays real. I really enjoyed this anime fully. 
Facit, this is an excellent slice of life anime. If you are undecided, watch it. If the general tags ""slice of life, comedy"" are in your wheel of preferences, watch it. You won't be disappointed. But if you are looking something like Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!, this is not your series. Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! is slightly shoujo, slightly loli, slightly slice of life, slightly romance, slightly  something. Not my taste, but not bad. Usagi Drop is not loli, it is not shoujo. It is just not really similar to Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. But it is definitely worth trying!

[Contains SPOILERS; skip to last paragraph to avoid all possible spoilers] 
Fate/Zero, a series that has captivated me in many facets, refuses to budge from its deadlock position it has held me in from the very first episode with its servant summoning ritual spells, to the last episode with our battle-weary protagonist’s last few moments with his adopted son in the moonlight. (Just the first episode alone spurred me on a marathon consisting of the rest of the first season and all of Fate Stay/Night.) 
The mechanics of the series dictates a part of the plot, and in its dictation, the master’s strategies and the plot slowly piece together like a puzzle, and this enigmatic facet of F/Z is what contributes a part to capturing not only attention, but interest; it’s often not the most efficient or logical way to charge into your opponent’s domain without researching them or making a coherent plan. The way the series immerses its audience in the conveyed environments and the way it does what it does is through its sublime art style and underlying, complementary music; least to say, the combined effect leaves an emotional aftertaste. Additionally, check if you’re an earthling if you denied Ilya or Rin’s adorability, not the most crucial constituents to the series but rather evidence of the indescribably likable art style. The opening and endings are appropriate sheaths and caps for the series collectively and the ending Manten is even more so the silver platter beneath the scrumptious serving, albeit a relatively small one.  
The ambient sentiments make it immensely enjoyable and more vicariously palatable. Even though some acknowledged Fate/Zero for its action, it should be known also for its characterization and developments, which is executed well eminently for Kiritsugu, Saber, Kirei, Waver, and Rider to name a few. For instance, episodes that exemplified such quintessential characterization were the ones that provided the necessary parts of Kiritsugu’s backstory; he was originally an ordinary boy who would one day inherit the Emiya family crest and continue the inherited work on a seemingly typical island with its mythic, underlying tale. That changed when he ran away from the reality of the product of his father’s work and his crush’s aspirations; his action ultimately led to his newfound ideal and justification for his deeds. He was notorious for his tactic of downing an entire jetliner just because his target was there; however, the full circumstances are disclosed in just one episode and the old image of Kiritsugu, the one that Kirei had initially speculated upon, shattered. For Saber, Berserker and Lancer’s participation complemented her characterization well; Berserker sufficed in doing so for her past and new reason to obtain the Grail, Lancer for building on their chivalrous principles, and Kiritsugu for contrasting combat methods.  
Simultaneously, aside from the thriller, action, and magical aspects, the series also tells a tale of budding friendship (between Waver and Rider), and love and tragedy between Kiritsugu and Irisviel and (unreciprocated love for) Kariya, whose dreams went unrealized. The series correctly implemented the elements needed to evoke certain emotions: memorable scenes include Caster’s conviction of a pure and fresh form of terror, Waver’s relinquishment of his status as master (when he and Iskandar start to see each other in a more vis-à-vis fashion in the symbolic solvation of the distinction between master and servant), Kiritsugu’s final conversation with Natalia, and Rin’s adventure, the last of which was a well-done deviation.  
The series overall offered a cornucopia: elegant dialogue and lyrics, broad character (and relationship) development, solid mechanics, an enticing plot and conflicts, immaculate visuals (especially for the Blu-ray), and last but far from least, highly gratifying, enjoyable set of music (particularly the OP/EDs).

Disclaimer: I have not watched all of the episodes of Logh, however, I am well aware of anything that happens in these episodes and my limited understanding shows that none of those things significantly impact the quality of the story. 
The Legend is a cult classic in the anime community and is held up by elitists and plebs alike to be one of the best anime series to have ever been released. Personally, I find it to be the best anime that I have currently watched, although, as is all else, that is up to debate. What I will say is that the Legend boasts a finely crafted, if not a bit unreasonable at times, narrative with a cast well beyond the size of any normal anime that does a surprisingly good job at making sure that all characters have some sort of characterization and are in some way useful to the plot. 
Characters: 
In terms of the main characters, the show boasts both Yang Wen-li and Reinhard von Lohengramm. Yang Wen-li is a simple man who doesn’t enjoy the thought of his actions and is only loyal to his paycheck and to the basic ideals of democracy. Wen-li received a decent amount of character development as he grew more accustomed to being the spotlight of the galaxy, and to truly fighting for the ideals that people like Heinessen preached and creating his own Democratic system in the form of the Iserlohn Republic. He is often defined as a little preachy on his monologues about the ideals of government, however, he is often described as a mentor figure to Julian who he spouts most of this too, and, when he is not trying to teach what he believes is correct to Julian, he is usually arguing against authoritarians such as the National Salvation Military Council and Reinhard, or to question his own actions as to if he should believe in a system that led to people like Job Trunighct to being in power. In that way, he is excused. Julian acts like an extension of Yang and genuinely feels as though he grows as a person into Yang’s successor. 
Next on the chopping block is Reinhard and Kircheis. Reinhard is a man of lofty ambitions, and believes, occasionally wrongly, that he can achieve the same of that of Rudolf von Goldenbaum, the man who founded the Galactic Empire. Reinhard, however, is a bit emotionally unstable and acts out of bounds on multiple occasions, such as challenging his subordinates to rebel against him and allowing - million citizens of Westerland to be killed by Prince Braunschweig in order to accomplish his goals. This makes him feel more realistic than many other characters in anime that try to accomplish the same purpose as him. However, he always (yeah, certainly always) has his friend, Siegfried Kircheis, to consult on matters he really shouldn’t do. He is portrayed a little bit too much as a white knight, knowing what is right in every situation, however, his goodness is what eventually killed him at the hands of someone he really shouldn’t have died against. He felt compelled to help Reinhard as they both have a motivation against the nobles in the form of Countess Grunewald, and he really needed to be that way in order to provide for Reinhard, so, in that sense, there is a reason as to why he acts the way he does, even if it feels somewhat jarring while you are watching the show. 
As previously mentioned, there is an extremely large cast of characters, so I must shorten this character section for the purposes of keeping this review from being one of the longest on this website. In that sense, I will only mention a few more characters, as well as putting general cast problems at the very end. There are also other good characters in this series. Some of my personal favorites being Oscar von Reuenthal, for his arc that inevitably ended in his betrayal and his personal friendship with Wolfgang Mittermeyer; Paul von Oberstein, for his scheming and albeit a little jarring attitude of agreeing to do acts that seem unjust for the purpose of completing his goals; and Admiral Bucock, for his steadfast belief in Democracy, even in the face of the Galactic Kaiser himself. There are other good examples that need mentioning, but, for the sake of brevity, I will try to leave them out for now. They do have some individual problems between them, but nothing that would hurt the overall quality of the shows. 
Things that do hurt the overall quality, however, are those one-dimensional characters that creep up every once and again. The terraists are clearly the worst example of this, for being simply one-dimensional maniacs bent on destroying all those who believe that the Earth shouldn’t be the main focal point of the galaxy. There is an explanation for their fanatic behaviors, in that they are poisoned into becoming fanatics, however, it should not totally excuse that they are lazy villains in an otherwise fairly brilliantly crafter narrative. The others are the one-dimensional politicians, such as the councilors that suggested the invasion of the imperial territories simply for getting another term in power. This did have a purpose in the criticism of democracy, and is exaggerated for the purpose of getting off that theme of the show, but is jarring to the point of ridiculousness at points. The Imperial Nobles are not much better, as they believe they are allowed to do things to their subjects simply because they are their lords. Of course, one could argue that it was the centuries of pandering to the nobility that allowed them to be this way, however, this flaw is still worth mentioning regardless. 
Overall, the characters are portrayed in a way that allows them to feel as though they are actual people. The plot allows you to care for these people after seeing their motivation and struggles over a decent amount of screentime. I have noticed some complaints that the show is too pro-empire in terms of character focus, but, considering that the empire only has a few more episodes dedicated to them than to the alliance, it really is not as big of a gap as some critics make it out to be. 
The Story: 
The Legend is a show that manages to be extremely in depth to the point where it actually feels as though there is a world beyond the events that we are shown on screen. There are several episodes that are focusing on smaller scale issues of nobles within the empire and of citizens of all sorts of worlds which give the impression of cultures that exist outside of the main cast, something most anime of large-scale struggle with. The Legend, however, is on a much larger scale than most of anime that would fall under that category. With hundreds of named characters spanning a series that contains --- episodes, around -- side stories episodes, and - movies, you can tell that the Legend fits into that long-running series category. However, unlike many other long-running series, the Legend does not degrade in quality significantly over its run. It keeps consistency in the quality of its characters and of its battle and storylines. 
The first main point of the plot is the themes. LOGH has two major themes, War is hell and Democracy vs Autocracy. The first main theme is War is Hell. This is mainly shown not only through the battles, where tens of thousands to sometimes even millions die and where portrayals of the ‘true brutality of combat’ are shown, but also through the dialogue of people like Yang Wen-li and João Rebelo, who show the true horrors of war from not only a physical perspective, but also a political and societal perspective. The next major theme is the benefits and detractions of Autocracy and Democracy. For the most part, I would say they are portrayed fairly evenly. Some may argue that the empire was favored more than the alliance, but I would argue that the only reason that is, is because the majority of the time, the empire was either under the direct control or under the influence of Reinhard von Lohengramm, something Yang acknowledges during his personal conversation with Reinhard. However, that does not belittle Yang’s point of view, with him constantly bringing the argument of how a person such as Rudolf the Great can always rise to power with very little protection against him. Even though the author is somewhat using the characters as mouthpieces for philosophy, it is never as bad as a series such as Fate/Zero and is believable due to the character’s personalities and actions before said dialogues. Overall, the themes are portrayed extremely well. 
For a small paragraph, I wish to bring up the point of the space battle in LOGH. Some criticize them for not fully utilizing the three dimensions of space. Firstly, there are a couple of scenes where they do use three dimensions. Secondly, there isn’t really any sci-fi that accomplishes this well, that doesn’t involve some kind of giant humanoid robot. Thirdly, the strategy and use of natural components in these battles at least makes up for this lack of use. 
The Legend utilizes some of the most interesting and captivating storylines in anime. The Legend gives much time on its character, however, the story is not left entirely alone. The Legend portrays the events unfolding in the series as parts of history, with a narrator involved. Many people dislike the narrator because he “spoils” many of the major events in the series. The narrator allows the series to be portrayed as the title suggests, a ‘Legend’. He also gives us some insight of how future historians and people viewed the men and the events that occurred during the events of the story. He is also good for foreshadowing, as he always gives hints on to what occurs in the future without explicitly telling the audience. The audience is not completely devoid of knowledge of the past either, as it is portrayed to the audience in two episodes (cleverly as well, deciding against direct exposition and instead vouching for the characters themselves to learn of these events along with the audience). 
Another bonus point to the Legend is its portrayal of events in the storyline. The Legend, especially in the first season, enjoys portraying both small incidents that do not affect the plot all that much and massive events that will change the events of the character forever. There are episodes that show how the politicians of the Free Planets Alliance come to their decisions, how the people who live in imperial territory reacted to the Free Planets Alliance invasion into imperial territory, how the nobles of the empire attempted to carry out plots against the Kaiser and other nobles (never truly losing the audience’s interest as they always involve the main characters in some capacity), as well as many other events that I will not name here. All of these happenings give rise in the audience to the idea that the Legend has a world that extends far beyond what the main characters are experiencing. This helps to upkeep the abnormally large scale that the Legend tries to have, and gives the audience more investment into the world and the story than what can be accomplished by much other anime series.  
Art/Animation: 
The art style of the Legend is certainly dated, looking extremely reminiscent of its compatriots in the ----s and ----s. However, the realistic style of the Legend helps to overcome these flaws. Many of the characters in the show were designed to be handsome, however, unlike the characters designed today that fulfill the same purpose, the Legend never makes the character designs overly unrealistic to the point where you can not take them seriously, as is what happens to some of the series of today. It always makes the character designs believable, while maintaining the style that many producers use as to capture the attention of those who would otherwise not notice this product. There are several scenes that are not as detailed, not necessarily because of the laziness of the artists (although that does play a role), but because of the budget constraints that the production studios faced during the economic depression that occurred in Japan during the early ----s. However, most of these mistakes were touched up in the DVD releases which is what an average person who has seen the show would have seen due to the show’s old age. The characters also never make unrealistic movements, which adds to the serious tone that the show possesses. Overall, nothing in the animation and art department degrade the plot in any serious way and can even boost the viewer’s experience in some instances. 
Sound: 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes’ soundtrack is comprised almost entirely of classical music. This allows the audience to take it more seriously, as any other form of music would not work quite as well for the background soundtrack, as it would make the series seem as though it is not taking itself seriously, which is something it surely is. The soundtrack is objectively quite beautiful, and not something that any viewer would normally attempt to stray away from. None of the songs are forgettable, and many would easily see themselves listening to this soundtrack outside of the series itself. None of the songs are necessarily misplaced either. The sound design is, for the most part, quite good and fits the series extremely well. 
Conclusion: 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a series that boasts both a highly realistic cast of characters and an immersing story that will never become overly lacking in quality as many series are. It is truly a classic that can be enjoyed by both elitists and casuals alike. This reputation has earned the series the moniker of “the anime for people who hate anime.” While it may have its flaws, they never overtake the series’ quality in any major way. The legend is truly a classic of anime that deserves much praise and respect. In the very least, that is one man’s humble opinion. I would recommend this anime series to anyone who watches anime that is not overly fixated on any single genre (of course, if they are fixated on space dramas, then that bypasses this point). Anyway, regardless of my opinions and the series itself, I want everyone who took time out of their day to read this to be in good health. I have been Kakorat---, this has been Kakorat’s review of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and I wish all of you to have a happy day. Be safe.

This show is average to downright bad in looks. The story is boring and hard to follow. The music is forgettable. And, I didn't enjoy this, as evidenced by my never finishing it. 
The art has this ugly muted color palette. Yeah, sure, it was going for some ""dark and gritty"" stuff, but the animation was so lackluster that it didn't work. They try to go for some ""popping"" scenes, but it uses these all red color palettes, and stays like that for far too long. There were some interesting colors with the weapons, I guess. 
The dub is just... bad.  
There was this guy who worked in the same place as Gai that was extremely predictable and annoying. You will know if you watch the show. 
Overall, I didn't enjoy this show at all. They try to go for super edgy; and yes, they got super edgy. Do I like ""super edgy""? No.

Snowed - feet compacted into -, muscles are aching from shoveling and about -.- shots into a glass of Ketel One. Bear with me on this review. 
Story: 
LOL I've had this tab open for the longest time and I didn't even realize I haven't typed a THING! JEez, not good. Maybe if I drink a little more I'll stay focused. Give me a second........... Alright, I actually sorta kinda likes this anime. There was something about the premise that made it fun but there were cracks in the facade of 'quality' that showed themselves real early. 
This came in with jokes of hebephilia where the adult male character finds himself making jokes about his attraction to a teenager. I don't care if this is the culture of jokes that Anime sometimes embraces. Just because it's a 'culture' doesn't mean I can't pop a few drinks back and say, ""This culture sucks!"" You know why? Because it does! These sort of jokes aren't funny because the sort of outcome that is implied would never happen, and there are no happy endings for such relationships. It's stupid, and I'm gonna stop myself before I start a drunken rant on how stupid it is and start focusing more on the story. 
One long complaint up there and I still gave a -/--. The reason being, jokes were well-placed, even if they were bad. I really think ecchi and stuff like that is boring, uninteresting, and inappropriate. But, because of some of the pacing and jokes, things at times were quite funny. However, the most comical content had nothing to do with breasts or nudity. But, the worst part is that don't remember a single joke made. In fact, the most memorable scenes were the ones I tested, like characters making jokes about their breast size or a bunch of old men in a hot tub. Makes me wonder what my buzzed mind is telling me... 
Art: 
I felt the animation was alright at times but I despise, not only ecchi, but the modern embrace of more artwork. It's really offputting to me and perhaps I'm getting to opinionated and not as objective as I like to be but it doesn't make this show any better, that's for sure. In fact, I think it really brings down a lot of it. 
Actually, I think it brings it down a lot but that's just because the show itself was pretty mediocre and pairing that with the irritating and uninspired animation made things all the more worse. Damn, like seriously, I hate moe artwork. It's one reason why I avoid a lot of modern shows. 
Granted, I don't think early ----'s  animation would have improved this steaming heap. 
Sound: 
Forgettable music and forgettable VA work. Not bad, not good. -/-- 
Character: 
The male lead is a hebephiliac and the so is the adult female lead. Not to mention the youngest character is so stupid I wanted to stop watching almost immediately. I just finished it out for the extra 'Completed' tag on my watch-list. 
Enjoyment: 
And it wasn't worth it. I almost would have preferred having this NOT be on my list. I can't say it was boring because it was somewhat enjoyable, but I can't say it's good because Ecchi and Moe stuff are - of the dumbest things on the planet. So, here I am giving it a -/--. 
Oh well. At least my Vodka bottle is near empty. Gives me an excuse to finish it.

Mirai Nikki. After finishing all -- episodes (and the OVA), I rate this -/--. There will be some spoilers in this review. 
The openings and endings in the show, are nothing overly impressive. Although the first opening to the show (Kuusou Mesorogiwi) absolutely astounded me, the second opening (Dead End) wasn't as impressive and sounded similar to a lot of other openings. I found both endings forgetful and unimpressive. I liked the old sound, like a gramophone, at the start of the second ending. However, I was only impressed by the first five seconds before the gramophone sound disappeared. The rest of the ending was almost identical to Kuusou Mesorogiwi, however not as catchy or interesting. However, I'll admit that the OST is interesting compared to most of the horror genre. It explores various themes, whilst many are still memorable. It fails to stick into one genre, which is a plus in my opinion. You never know what you're going to expect with it, that's what makes it so memorable to me. 
The characters are my main problem with this show. I couldn't connect with Yuki or Yuno. In fact, Yuno's obsession over Yuki was annoying rather than cute. Yuno felt more like fan service than an actual strong character. The only reason Yuno was such a memorable character, was because of her yandere personality. Out of all the characters, I found that the diary users (apart from Fourth, Yuno and Yuki) were the most interesting. The death of Third was too abrupt and I would have preferred the show if it went into more detail surrounding him. Eighth was the biggest let down character wise. She appeared as a kind-hearted woman and I would have loved to see more of the story based around her. However, I did take an interest in Ninth (Minene) and liked how she became more of a main character near the end. She acted the most humanly out of all -- diary users. At the beginning, I assumed she would be the conventional crazy antagonist with pigtail and the cliche dress and voice. However, as the series progresses, you begin to understand more about Minene and how she is anything but the crazy girl cliche. 
The plot, where do I start? The first thing I noticed about the show, was how promising the plot seemed from the synopsis. However, the plot had too many holes. One minute the parents were having a fight (for no reason), the next thing we know, the mum's dead. It was too sudden to have any sort of affect and it felt like she had died just for the sake of someone dying. Another fault in the plot, was it's use of unnecessary episodes. Episodes -, - and -- had no affect on the main plot at all. They had a problem, it got resolved, they carried on killing other diary users after. However, there were some decent points in the plot, which I thought were interesting and engaging. I liked how they decided to flip the story on its head in the last quarter of the show. I was comfortable with the plot, I knew where it was going and didn't see any twists. Although I was correct for the majority of the show, the last quarter in no doubt surprised me a lot. I could never have guessed quite how the story ended up, even if it wasn't exactly satisfactory. Overall, the plot had too many holes, was dragged out for too long, only became interesting nearer to the end, and was a huge mess.

To be honest, especially at the beginning, I was expecting the female protagonist to be the typical, annoying female protagonist. However, through character development, she is actually becoming a great character, in fact by the end of season one she is very strong and tough, and not relying on her little harem of dragons following her around. She is no longer crying over the little things she would when she was at the beginning. She can take a punch now.While she still has a hint of naivety to her, I can't wait to see how she will continue to grow in the next season!

Spoiler Alert! 
There are some nice thing's about this, but those few nice things aren't really enough to make up for it's flaws. 
I'll keep this review quick, after all there are just two episodes, so no need to go into too much detail. 
-. Story: Actually this is the best about this series. The idea of using hypnosis to get the girl you like and your sister to perform sexual deeds for you, isn't really bad at all. Quite enjoyable in fact.  
-. Art: Not bad, but also very mediocre. Some scenes look good, some not so much. There are some moments where the anatomy just seems off. 
-. Sound: Nothing out of the ordinary. The soundtrack is pretty 'ok' as well as the voice acting. Again, nothing special, but not horrible. 
-. Characters: Well, they are not bad at all. I quite like, that the guy is not your typical anime protagonist, thin and slanky. While I myself could not identify with him I didn't 'dislike' him. As for the two females, they are both average looking and that makes them quite enjoyable. As it seems with everything in this series, there isn't anything particularily outstanding about these characters. The sister is tsundere, but we barely get to see that side of her. 
-. Enjoyment: The story and idea behind this got me thinking, my own imagination kicked in and I thought of the females around me, that I'd hypnotize if given the chance. That made me enjoy this little series a lot more than the series itself. 
All in all this isn't a bad one, but it sure as hell is only average.

- episodes of no plot, unfunny jokes, and a waste of time. Its like an Adam Sandler movie was turned into an anime and they made that a series. Could best be summed up by the first ten minutes of the first episode. Food Preferences. 
Now time for a real review.  
Its a honest hit or miss and is best enjoyed in the half paying attention state.  
Pros 
great art style 
great opening 
Cons 
No story 
no character development 
Honestly I see most people say it as a decent anime from their childhood which is why i think some many people enjoy it.

Let’s be honest, if this didn’t have Batman and other DC characters in it, very few people would hesitate to call it a dumpster fire. The story is confusing nonsense, the action scenes are messy, the low framerate is headache-inducing, and the pacing is just a pathetic failure.  
On paper, Ninja Batman's plot sounds like a fun time, but this film just skipped the whole storytelling process. To summarize the plot better than the film does: Gorilla Grodd created a time machine and now a dozen iconic DC heroes and villains are transported to feudal Japan. If Batman doesn’t stop the Joker, he will rewrite history and they’ll all be trapped forever. Most of the screentime is on Batman and a few friends like Catwoman, Robin, and Alfred, all with spiced up character designs to resemble the time period.  
With a plot as convoluted as this one, the audience needs to be able to understand what's happening at all times. Typically your average superhero flick would do what's necessary to hold your attention by slowing down the pacing during exposition scenes to clarify the story, of course with some cringy comic relief to ensure no one gets bored. It's not the most impressive form of storytelling, but it's at least functional. Ninja Batman opted to give us all the 'classic' cringy comic relief and very little of the typical formulaic storytelling. Instead, we're dropped into action scenes with the occasional catchphrase at the start and during fight scenes so we can gauge how important  
At the beginning of the film, Batman is seen running around the side of a building, then suddenly we're in Japan and he's wearing a Samurai costume. Very little makes sense and the movie expects you to forgive it by tossing in a bunch of familiar characters. A desperate attempt to make you feel nostalgia, that is frankly so transparent it resembles a toy commercial. It's the definition of 'turn off your brain entertainment' but how can I if criticize and appreciate what the film does well if I'm not thinking about it?? 
This one wouldn’t be a problem if the action looked good, but it’s at best decent and at worst an eyesore. Right away you’ll notice it’s all in CGI, not even faces are drawn. Due to the overabundance of effects, individually animated objects, and a constant explosion of color it is very hard to keep track of what’s even occurring. While I can’t deny it looks good when it focuses on one set piece at a time, it is rarely content with simplicity. It wants very badly for you to be entertained, going so far as to vomit all over your screen to ensure you keep watching. The CGI used here isn’t bad on a whole, but the character models are noticeably on a lower frame rate from the rest of the film, which gives them a headache-inducing inconsistency. Showcasing the franchise's iconic heroes in their feudal costumes and wacky anime hairstyles is what this film cares about the most, but no amount topknots and katanas can distract us from the hideous janky character animation. 
What’s worse is the voice acting rarely is synced with the -D character models. This wouldn't have been such a distracting issue if the characters mouths had been drawn on, sadly chose the easier option. The English voice acting is mediocre at best, I would place it slightly below the modern DC cartoons. Batman sounds fine but nowhere near Kevin Conroy, only able to decently replicate his voice at a certain range and rarely given the opportunity to showcase talent. It’s clear the voice of the Joker was trying his best, and it comes through in his overdone performance, but he still has nothing on Mark Hamill. So if you’re dead set on watching Ninja Batman there’s that to consider, the voices of the many characters aren’t performed by the best actors.  
At any chance the film gets it does try and cash in on nostalgia, always throwing random characters at you like Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Bane, Deathstroke, Gorilla Grodd, Poison Ivy, and of course the Joker. It doesn’t care if it makes sense that they’re all teleported to Japan, this movie wasn’t intended to be thought about but to be watched and forgotten.  
The dialogue depends way too much on the characters' previous versions, rather than developing the characters it gives us recognizable catchphrases. Which means if you’re not a fan of the series you will be completely lost. No development beyond surface level characterization makes it very hard for us to care about any of them, which is largely the reason why the stakes are not tangible. It should have been exciting to watch but instead, it was just alienating and boring. At least the visuals were somewhat decent. 
There were a few interesting ideas thrown into the mix to keep you from falling asleep. Halfway through, the film switches into a style similar to Masaaki Yuasa’s work where the visuals look hand-drawn rather than CGI, and it genuinely grabbed my attention. It wasn’t very visually appealing in its own right, but I appreciated the director trying to give us a reprieve from the CGI action.  
There are a few references to past entries in the franchise, not that they made any sense being put where they were. Usually, it was a single catchphrase you've heard millions of times before just to distract you from the clusterfuck of a movie. The most notable reference was the ridiculous use of the giant mecha Voltron fighting against an equally sized mech in the shape of ----s Batman. Nothing made sense, and it didn't matter really, at -- minutes in I had given up expecting a well-made film.  
Plenty of old jokes are dug up to be milked a bit more before they send them back to whichever better DC film they came from. The action is still a little bit exciting in all its visual disjointedness, but it’s leagues below any previous Batman movies it steals its jokes from. Even the latest DC dumpster fires looked better than this. There’s still fun to be had with it, just like you could have fun watching the equally terrible Suicide Squad, if you can forgive the horrible writing and messy directing.  
Unless if you’re a big fan of the DC universe, avoid it.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. 
This is review is more or less ---% spoilers so if you haven't seen the series, don't read this review.  
Alright, down to business. I liked the plot twist in the middle of the series where the heroes find out that the effects of going Mankai is permanent, and not temporary. I thought it would create an interesting balance between duty and self preservation. I also understood why Tougou and Fuu wanted to destroy the tree of life or whatever. If they managed to go through with it, I would've probably given the show a - or a -- just for having the balls to be unique and say 'fuck you' to the formula. 
But no, something or other happens, after the show spends like -- episodes telling you actions have consequences, actions no longer have consequences because of reasons. Everybody gets better, the end. Probably the only show that has managed to make me sad that the ending is happy. Probably because of all the squandered potential.

STORY: Code Geass is a story about just/unjust war, the aftermath, peace, and pride. There is great content here with multiple levels of conflict, making the process of deciding right and wrong very difficult. The plot lines are complex, easily drawing the viewer into this fictional world. While the story is not tangibly realistic, the show is quite convincing and alluring. With Code Geass the plot material is serious and demanding. Silliness, fun times, and character development are required and acceptable as long as they remain within the established context. At times the story-telling of Code Geass steps out of its theme, and the flow of the solid story loses impetus and direction in uncharacteristic light-heartedness. The show is then thrust back to its original course which can be jarring. The negative effects of this shift result in a loss of the strong conviction by which the show is driven. Also, this series is not finished, and the end is a huge slam on the brakes. I do not consider the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion to the -- episode season to be detrimental, but the end will leave you craving more. Besides the occasional sharp, awkward shift in the plot dialect, the story of Code Geass is fantastic and one of the best of the --------- season. 
ART: Sunrise is one the oldest and most reputable animation production companies in Japan, and they have no problems upholding their reputation with Code Geass. Although it's not the best I've ever seen, the animation is very good. At no point is the art direction bad or frown worthy. Mecha fights are convincing enough, dramatic scenes are illustrated well with emotion in mind, and filler scenes don't fall below the established visual standard. The animation is very good, but, more importantly, the animation is consistently good. 
SOUND: The voice acting is okay. Some of the voice actors blew me away, especially Suzaku's. Some of the actors left me feeling a little soapy with opera, especially Leuloch's. At times important lines, ones meant to finish a powerful scene with conviction, fall short of their mark. However, the voice acting is situational. Sometimes Leuloch's voice actor convinced me to the fullest. At other times the voice actor made me roll my eyes and laugh.  The sound effects are decent, and the music is good at getting the audience interested. However, the soundtrack here does not take command of the epic saga, and there are no moments where the music capitalizes on a scene. The audio aspect of Code Geass is sometimes hit or miss, and the audio is always runner-up to the other facets of the show. 
CHARACTER: There are tons of characters in Code Geass, and the show does an exceptional job of trying to involve each and every one of them. Even among the farfetched fantasy of the show, the characters felt unnervingly human and real. Amongst the diverse multitude of characters, there are complex characters being developed through genuine, deep emotions. And then there are the characters who are well developed but not deep. These characters seem out of place like infants among giants. Whenever these normal characters are on screen, the show drops the ball and begins to feel out of place. The screen time was a little too divided between the true characters and the cookie cutter characters. The true characters of the show sold the story and are arguably the strongest element of the show. I just wish they received more time and focus. 
ENJOYMENT: Code Geass is compelling, complex, and convicting, and the final product leaves your heart pounding with tension and suspense. While the experience is very entertaining and enjoyable, Code Geass is dark. As the characters make decisions with massive consequences, the vast amount of emotional weight of the show can easily affect the viewer. The show is fun to watch and equally difficult to watch. As previously stated in the story section, the show does not do a good job of providing light-heartedness and release from the stress. Thus, the peaceful and happy scenes feel forced and out of place at times. Still, Code Geass is entertaining and involving. 
OVERALL: Code Geass is an intelligent and provocative, war-time, think piece. The production has flaws but is still great, and the final product is much greater than the show's parts. 
I hope this review has been beneficial. All feedback, critiques, and comments are appreciated and well accepted through messages. Happy anime watching!

The first thing i want to say is: ""rebuilding"" Evangelion was in no way necessary. However, the result is not too terrible, it just doesn't manage to reach the original show, not at all, at least in this first movie. That depends on a certain viewpoint though, i will talk about that in the first section, the story. Never break a working pattern, after all. 
Story: For all intents and purposes, ""You are (not) alone"" is a recap-movie, summarizing the first few episodes of the classic with some new animation. A lot of scenes had to be omitted, some they added, the gist of all the events is still comprehendable. They are two ways to look at the rebuild-movies, either as a remake or a sequel. Now isn't that interesting? Cause there is pretty heavy evidence that maybe, after the events of the ""End of Evangelion"" the whole world entered some sort of loop. On the top of my head, the sea being suddenly red and Kaworu literally saying it happens again. Of course, i'd never thought of this, all that i am writing here someone else compiled. There is more to this theory, but until anything gets directly confirmed it is just that. A theory. Now if i had to rate the story, i'd call it good. Wait, i actually do have to rate it. I just felt something was missing, but of course, if it is a sequel, then we already saw everything in the show before. Maybe that is what they were doing, similar to how brotherhood rushed through the start, simply expecting the viewer to have already watched Fullmetal Alchemist. It remains to be seen, for now, this is what it is.  
Art: A slight improvement, but that's the point. It's nothing major. Over ten years passed and the old show still stands up to the remake. I think that's really impressive. They are no stillframes and other budget-preserving techniques at work anymore, but as i mentioned, those scenes added to Eva's charm. Given that it's a modern work, i lower the score this time. The Art was impressive back in the day, now it's only very good. 
Sound: It's the same sounddesign, the same voice actors, even the same OST, just with minor changes. Minus the opening and ending, what a tragedy. And since i don't like the ending theme for this movie, i give it a great this time. It's largely the same, but i think they rerecorded all the lines. Well, they better did. 
Character: Now i want to say nothing changed, but that is not the case. It can't be, cause all the time the show spent on these great characters is simply not there in a movie. Again, if this is a sequel, then all the development happened and it's kinda forgiven. But we don't know that, so what remains is a similar characterization, it's just less deep, less detailed and it adds nothing new. Really, if you watched the show you don't learn anything different, no new aspect of these characters and if you watch this first you miss out on all the great things Evangelion did with it's characters. The characters are still good, it's not like anyone changed or acts out of line...so i guess i can give it an eight. I certainly wasn't impressed by the same stuff again.   
Enjoyment: I wasn't bored, that's good. But basically watching a recap, i also wasn't all that entertaining. The last scene between Rei and Shinji got me again, i'll admit that and bringing Kaworu in a little earlier is interesting. I guess a rate my enjoyment fair. I certainly look forward to what else they have in story for us, when the story starts to stray from it's original predecessor. 
Maybe Eva only worked in this certain moment, created by a person plagued by depression. Isn't that a terrible thing to say? But i see this movie and i kinda wonder what's the point of it. Do they regret not having the funds back then so they want to redo it in a better look? But nobody really cared for that anyway, the deep themes and characters sold Evangelion and made it such a classic. Or maybe they really want to finally clear things up, to give us the closure we simply never got. Or it's about money....yeah, probably. How sad.

art: All the women look the same. As in they all have the same face. This is a problem shared by all Miyazaki films and not just this one. At least Porco Rosso has a unique face. The art isn't very detailed, and the characters have only - level of shading (base color + a light shadow). So it's quite a simplistic art design, so I expected good animation.  
Animation: I didn't go through this movie frame by frame but the airplane movements were pretty smooth. The choppiness was not noticeable except for a few scenes. However I didn't notice any particularly fluid scenes either, like the fluidity of VHD:Bloodlust. So probably very little if any single framing in this movie. Overall it's better than TV quality, but it's not particularly smooth.  
Choreography: There was only one fight in this movie and it was a slugfest. There was no attempt by either participant to dodge or parry or block any attack. Instead they just swung wildly, taking all the hits, like two drunks. So the choreography really isn't anything to write home about.  
Conclusion: Not as good as people seem to think. Art is not particularly detailed, animation is not particularly smooth, and the fight choreography really sucks ass.

Try to walk and you may stumble.  
Cringe - that's the first word that pops into my mind when thinking of Tate no Yuusha. 
It's poorly written, lazy, offers nothing unique or interesting, but at least they kicked the cheese into overdrive.  
It starts out as your generic isekai nonsense; some random, average dude gets summoned into wonderland. This is *not* necessarily bad, but it ain't gonna win points for creativity either. But the show immediately begins to crumble. Where other shows take the effort to provide a semblance of explanation as to why MC gets selected and transported, this one says 'no' and skips it all. 
Standard MC introduction in - minutes (or less) and BOOM we're in business. 
And once you start falling, it's difficult to regain your balance. 
Immediately afterwards we're getting a boatload of cringe. - random dudes summoned, of course our Hiro must stand out even then - where the rest of them listen and think, MC starts this ""comedic freakout"" act and does so with aLOT of enthusiasm. 
But the other ""heroes"" listening and ""thinking"" isn't an upside, it's no compliment. They calmly state they don't care at all if fairyland is destroyed, not their problem, they want to be sent home -which is cold, but reasonable isn't it? But then they change their minds within a minute when they hear the magic word; 
""reward"", 
and proclaim they'll help *if* they get paid handsomely, with no subtle arrogance I might add. All -, in unison. Such heroes. And if you think they'll have a hard time believing they've been just summoned into the world of Dungeons and Dragons, then you'd be *very* wrong because apparently, DnD is common knowledge where they come from, (disregard the fact it's still just fairy tales). 
In the meanwhile, the show throws quite a few arbitrary rules at us to make things more difficult and unfair for our protagonist first and foremost. 
At this point, all my expectations were officially subverted. 
Moving on; eventually the - heroes get companions because what are RPGs without sidekicks right? But if you think it's the heroes who pick companions, then -PLOT TWIST- no. The companions choose the heroes, not up to debate. Doesn't make sense? Who cares! It creates drama! 
Because -ANOTHER PLOT TWIST - MC is chosen by nobody so he throws another ""comedic"" tantrum. 
Who could've foreseen this... 
...or the next - plot twists within -- minutes. 
So, that must mean it's a comedy like Slime or KonoSuba, yes? 
Haha, no. 
It's not. 
It most definitely is not. 
And so you fall and break. 
While the premise lacks creativity on every level, and the actions and reactions of characters are just comically absurd, it doesn't render the show terrible by default. Take Spongebob for example, it is just stupid, but herein lies the difference; Spongebob is self-aware. It knows it's stupid and doesn't try to act like grown-ups do. But this show does, and does so eagerly, using every trick in the book. 
The misunderstood and mistreated MC is the epitome of goodness yet tries to act like the bad guy (teens, eh?), except when it comes to actually *doing* bad, he backpedals. 
Every. 
Single. 
Time. 
Because he's the good main character you're supposed to be rooting for and no, you don't get to decide that. 
They made that choice for you, and they'll be damned if they don't force it down your throat every chance they get. 
And you'll eat it with a spoon...or give the show a rating of - to - because the writing is just bloody atrocious. 
You see Fashion Emo-kun is suffering over-the-top injustice by pretty much every other character introduced, for no real reason whatsoever. Every single character believes everything other characters say, no matter how ridiculous or nonsensical it sound, they will not have a shed of doubt. But absolutely NOBODY believes the Creep Hero. 
Because reasons. 
He's looked down upon because of nonsensical prejudice, he's not heard out or believed in because common sense wouldn't generate nearly as much melodrama, he's betrayed off the bat (and who didn't see it coming... I mean, -PLOT TWIST-) to make him the saddest victim of the world, then he's tossed out to fend for himself with nothing to his name but scorn, and even his class, the ""shield hero"" is holding him back because apparently, in this game ""shield slam"" is not a skill and all he can do is...shield stuff.  
""So why not just grab a sword and stab things?"" you ask? Because then he wouldn't be as miserable and that's bad, so -PLOT TWIST- he quite literally can't do that. Poor fella amirite? 
I said ""no real reason"", that's because there's an unreal one; you are supposed to feel sorry for him (I said BE SORRY DAMNIT!!-!--) and they made sure to remind you of that fact every other minute. 
Edgy, but least no more awkward humor, right? 
...Right? 
Oh, look... They actually found a way to put some awkward between the edges... 
...yay... 
And so the ""epic"" journey begins. MC's good and anyone who isn't with him (which is pretty much everyone else) hates his guts and tries to screw him over every chance they get, no matter how ridiculous it is, no matter the world's about to end, bullying him takes priority, his suffering is paramount! 
So ""conveniently"" all these cheesy villains took a number and lined up in an orderly fashion. 
Openly judging and berating someone based on hearsay? Pretence? Betrayal? Corruption? Blatant abuse of power? Hostages? Bottomless arrogance? Racism? Denial of reason for the sake of melodrama generation? 
Say no more, fam, it got you covered! 
It's black and white, characters are either angels or demons, and anyone opposing the Cringe Hero is most certainly twisted. 
This is what this show's really about. Nonsensical, soap opera level melodrama gift-wrapped in borrowed ideas, rated W for 'worthless', it's for everyone -- and below. Puts Bollywood to shame. 
Bloody -.- rating, it's unbelievable.

So, a lot of people take issue with the fact this movie only covers about one volume of the manga, but here's the thing: manga and film are two totally different mediums with different storytelling capabilities. If they tried to emulate the epic scope of the comic, it would have been disastrous; it's a little messy as is, but the cloak-and-dagger politics take a backseat to a subtle character-oriented approach, which makes it compelling. Who can't identify with this kind of adolescent rivalry? I can't do the animation justice, but's amazing. I dunno, maybe you just ""had to be there,"" i.e. had to be around -- years old having no idea what to expect when you saw it, but it left imprints in my brain. 
The typically Japanese impenetrable spiritualism the film eventually slips into is potentially alienating, but it's worth noting it has more depth than any of Miyazaki's eco-sermons.

Cafe Junkie. 
What can i say: its boring and its full of clichés.  
Even the sex scenes are boring. 
Characters: The guy's not interesting and not likable. 
The three girls are annoying to listen to. They all love the same guy. But where is this love coming from you may ask? Well i have no idea. 
Animation style is ok. However its censored. 
Story: Well the story goes nowhere. There is a love triangle (or should i say love square) between the guy and the - girls. 
And of course we have the cliché ending where instead of choosing one of the girls they decide to share him and have an orgy.

I don't think I've ever laughed at an anime more than i have for Konosuba. Not even the Ghost stories dub made me laugh this much. 
While there isn't much of a story to Konosuba, it doesn't stop the characters from developing with each. which has resulted in the best character interactions i have ever seen. the characters along with their voice actors are what make this so fun to watch. Unfortunately the personalities that the VA's built didn't carry over to the dub so well or at all, due to the pretty generic sounding voices, but that doesn't take away from enjoyment of the sub.  
The faces the characters are able to make are both hilarious and slightly disturbing, thanks to the amazing work of the artist and the animators. While this wouldn't play such a major role in an average  anime, it certainly makes all the difference in the scenes in Konosuba as they can change the mood so quickly.  
I have loved both seasons and hope that this amazing series will continue.

Clannad is an anime that I really wanted to sit down and watch. Many people I know online and in real life said that this anime was the greatest thing they've ever seen. My short opinion is Clannad is definitely not a bad anime, it's enjoyable at times, but it has plenty of problems, and i'll address those later in the review. I apologize to the die hard fans, i'll try to be gentle 
Story -/--- 
The story to Clannad is pretty strait foreward. It basically consists of the main character, Tomoya Okazaki, who is surrounded by a harem of women of different character archetypes, these women have some sort of issue or tragic past to share and it's up to Tomoya to fix the issue. For the most part, this works, but unfortunately, it does have it's issues. I won't go into the issues caused by the characters themselves just yet, but I feel I need to address the pacing issue in the anime, and I understand that you can't have a plot twist every - episodes, but it feels like somewhere between the Fuko Ibuki and Kotomi Ichinose arcs, literally nothing happens. I will cut Clannad some slack, it does have Visual Novel origins and doesn't have a ton to work with. The show did have it's moments, but getting to them took forever. I enjoyed seeing Tomoya, a usual rebel without a cause, try to help these girls with their issues, and Nagisa, the main female lead, does a great job of opening up Tomoya to the world. Let me just warn anyone looking to watch this ahead of time, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, and did I say moe? If you don't enjoy moe or you have an extreme hatred of it, you will not have a good time with this anime. 
Art -/-- 
The art needs to be praised, Clannad's animation is absolutely gorgeous, but that's to be expected from Kyoto. The only true error with the animation is actually not at the fault of Kyoto itself, but rather the original source material. Unfortunately, the thing you will be staring at the most, the characters, are my only complaint. All I can say is, THE EYES!!!!!!!! No joke, the characters eyes, mainly the female ones, are literally bigger than their hands! Although it makes them look cute, it's incredibly awkward to stare at, but you will get over it after awhile. Other than that, the animation is butter smooth and full of color. 
Sound --/-- 
Luckily, none of Clannad's issues come from it's sound. The backtracks in Clannad are very fitting and never feel out of place, I particularly enjoy the track that plays during the girl and robot segments. The opening and ending themes are fantastic, the Dango family theme will be stuck in your head by the end. Overall, the music is great. The voice acting, dub in particular , could have been better, but overall, I made it through the entire series in dub so it couldn't have been that bad. I'd like to mention Greg Ayres as Sunohara and Christina Luci as Nagisa for their excellent work on this dub. That said, unless you're a die hard dub fan, you may want to stick with the sub. 
Characters -/-- 
Easily the biggest issue this anime has is it's characters. I know that the characters are from a visual novel, but it feels like some characters get the spotlight, while others are just thrown to the side for the time being. The - main characters that get the spotlight, are Fuko, Kotomi, and Tomoyo. The characters all seem to conveniently have tragic backstories that I will admit, do pull a few tears even from a guy like myself, but once you get the same formula of tragic backstory, then Tomoya comes to save the day, it ends up being rather generic. The characters are rather likable, however, and you do feel bad for them. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't go into to much more detail, I want to address the forgotten characters though. For example, it feels like the Fujibayashi twins get no spotlight at all. They do get their special OVA episode, but as for actual canon, nothing. The characters are diverse enough to set them apart from each other, with the  exception of Ryou and Nagisa being rather similar, although it's the usual archetypes you have seen anywhere else. One last complaint, I feel that besides the fact that she is clearly the favored member of the harem, and her family seems to be the most involved, Nagisa never got her special time in the spotlight, kind of like the things she did were secondary to the actual story, i'll be it, she got some time at the end to tie up loose ends. The character Sunohara, is definitely my favorite character, he is up beat and always makes me laugh, even if it's right after a sad moment. Akio and Sanae Furukawa are also great characters, who in a way, become more like parents to Tomoya then his own father, but dear god, Sanae is a terrible bread baker. Overall, this is definitely Clannad's biggest short coming. 
enjoyment -/-- 
Overall, I enjoyed watching Clannad, I definitely see why people hold it to such a high regard. Although it does have it's problems, it never became unwatchable, and I found myself growing attached to these characters by the end. The main thing keeping this category from getting any higher, is the painfully slow pace this show moves at. Otherwise this show kept me interested until the end, and I felt I got a satisfying ending, or rather, lead into the After Story. Not to mention, I was very happy to see Tomoya and Nagisa become an actual couple 
Overall -/-- 
Just to recap: 
Likes: 
-The main characters and the relationship that grows between them 
-Animation except characters 
-All of the music 
-Certain actors from the English Dub 
-Sunohara 
Dislikes: 
-Painfully slow pace 
-Fujibayashi twins had no time in the spotlight 
-Nagisa didn't do a ton as a main character 
-Plot convenient tragic backstories 
Would I recommend it?  
If you're into moe drama love stories, or are just looking for something cute to watch that can make you cry one minute, than have you laughing the next, than I would recommend Clannad. If you're not, than you will probably dislike this anime a lot, as it's problems become more apparent when you don't have the cute, love story aspects to fall back on.

There was a trend back in the Good Old Days of anime (as in you only thought they were Good because you weren't Old enough to know any better) of hyper violent OVAs. Deadman Wonderland feels like a tread back to those days. It has the over-exaggerated violence, the ridiculous amounts of blood, the awkwardly crowbarred in sexiness and, most noticeably of all, it’s utterly shit. 
Time has changed a few little aspects though. The OVA market of old has turned into the late night -- episode anime series of today. This means it has more space to tell a coherent and fulfilling story, a capability which Deadman Wonderland approaches by totally ignoring it. -- episodes are enough to tell a neat story with a beginning, middle and end. It gets the beginning right, tossing our protagonist into a scenario in which society have become so totally ignorant of the prison sector, so that even when hell is being created right in front of their eyes, they think it’s an elaborate piece of CGI. 
However, upon reaching the 'middle' segment, Deadman Wonderland tosses that whole story aside and becomes about super powers. Instead of developing the characters introduced in the beginning, it decides to quadruple the size of the cast, each and every single one having a hastily constructed backstory introduced right in the middle of a fight to the death that ends up having either little or no relevance to the actual battle happening in the present day. Neither does Deadman Wonderland get the 'end' part right either. This is partly due to the fact this is an ongoing manga, but plenty of other adaptations of ongoing manga have managed to construct some sort of conclusion in their respective stories. Usually this is in the form of the main character growing and learning something (see Arakawa, Spice and Wolf or Genshiken), which Deadman Wonderland tries to do, but royally cocks up because the main character has fuck all personality. 
Yes, this is something else that comes with modernity. Instead of the macho men that spout 'witty' quips like they're in an American first person shooter game (that is, when they ever talk at all), Deadman Wonderland sports a bland spineless teenage boy as its main character. To be fair to Ganta, he does actually do something other than make reaction noises while other characters monologue exposition at him, as is the trend in certain other modern day anime. He reacts to situations by either whining, crying or sobbing. It really isn't much of a personality, as any bland male would react to the cartoonish level of hell that exists in that prison in a similar fashion, and he really has nothing beyond that. There is chance for him to grow into a hero, and Deadman Wonderland tried to do that. Other characters would spout lines as to how much he's grown a spine and standing up for himself, but I failed to see that myself. He started off as a crybaby who could shoot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened. By the end, he was a crybaby who shot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened, except this time he could shoot off his magical blood bullets even faster than before. That's not character development! That's like saying a character has developed because he is now slightly better at picking his nose.  
Another thing the late night -- episode anime has changed from the hyper violent OVAs of old is, now that they're on TV, they need to be censored. I can't really criticise Deadman Wonderland for this though, which is a shame because it's a really easy target. The gun that shot black balls of censorship through people’s chests was one of the most unintentionally hilarious things I've seen all year. But if you were to watch the dvd release, the censorship would (presumably) be removed. It would be like criticising it for the screen being upside down because you watched it while standing on your head. It's not the anime's fault you watched it that way. But the fact that it needed the level of censorship it has tells us how much blood and gore there is. Often the gore has no point other than to show how sadistic the anime is. It's really just repulsive and juvenile, like a child who tries to show everyone what a big man he is by killing the class rabbit. 
Deadman Wonderland is like a modern day MD Geist. It's aggressively stupid and only appeals to those teenagers and manchildren who think sheer bloody mindedness is what is required to make something cool. People might defend this by saying a hyper violent anime is preferable to the insipid harem moe nonsense of the modern era, which is a load of cowpat. They are both as brainless as each other, just appealing to different sorts of immature mindsets. If you gave me a choice between Deadman Wonderland or, say, Fortune Arterial, I'd instead choose repeatedly slamming my fingers in a car door.

Sword Art Online is easily one of the most overrated anime out there. Sure, the first few chapters are indeed enjoyable but if you want something that won't leave you feeling like you just wasted a bunch of time, then do not watch this. 
The characters are simple and boring, with no development whatsoever, the main ""girl"" seems refreshing from the usual love interest but ends up being exactly that. Kirito, the main character, is so annoyingly overpowered, and every other character is just there for fan service and are extremely easy to forget, except, of course, for the main character's child, who appears out of nowhere and just adds to Kirito's annoying powers. 
The art style is boring and nothing out of the ordinary. The animation is good, but there's only so much you can do with such a generic style. 
The sound is the best thing of this anime, it is enjoyable and adds a sense of excitement to what, in any other situation would have been boring. 
My final statement is, this is a dreadful anime, do not watch it if you want something other than fanservice.

This is easily one of the worst things that i watched this year. 
Story: A complete mess. There are the times where the plot is beyond insulting when it comes to originality. I was able to predict almost every ""plot twist"" from miles away. 
Also the movie is never clear regarding its target audience. Does the movie wants people who are crazy focused, people that dont try to think too much about the plot, people with absolutely no brain cells? Well i dunno so lets just put scenes that target all of those people individually. So yeah there are scenes that require a shit ton of focus so you dont miss anything and then there are multiple scenes of spiritual sexual harassment... ugh. 
The interaction between... wait a minute. The main characters (almost) never interact with each other directly... 
I'm pathetic when it comes to romance stories (that aren't the main atraction but rather a side story or something that is there but you dont have to mind too much about). Whatever crap you show me will always receive praise because im a sucker for it. But when it comes to a fully romance focused story my critic sense is on alert. Kimi no Na wa is not a romance story. This movie is not about romance. I cant be more clear about it. 
There never is a reason for why these characters should care about each other at all. 
Their ""interactions"" are friendly but that's about it. Aside from the pseudo sexual harassment (what does that mean? Well there is the dude, he goes into the girls body like this were some hentai anime and he starst grabing her chest and this happens like - times on screen and god knows how many times he did that) there is  absolutely no reason for these characters to have romantic feelings for each other (there is even a part where the girl seems to be into girls. Maybe she is bisexual i dunno). 
There is no originality at all on the movie and when it comes to stories of this ""genre"" (the ones that saw the movie know what im talking about, mentioning it would be spoiler even though anyone with a few functioning brain cells could figure out the plot twist) the ammount of movies, shows, videogames and animes that use this and are genuinely good at it is inmense.  
I highly doubt that i ever saw an story of this ""genre"" that i disliked. How can you do something poorly with this ""genre""? Probably the most surprising part of the story is how poorly writen it was. 
There is an insane ammount of wasted screen time where we see shots of Tokyo (i explain my personal disdain with this on ""Art""), some japanese places, random characters that arent on the show, etc (the first scene is justified and it comes with a nice song too but the moment is prolonged for too long and it quickly loses its charm). 
Art: It looked cute i guess i dont have any complaint but it didnt blew my mind. 
It's obvious that this movie wasn't aiming for western gaijins like me and instead it tried to catch the eye of Japan. 
Sound: There is so many things wrong with this. 
Imagine i dunno Friday --, Alien or Saw. Now imagine that while some people are about to be dismembered or chopped in half in incredibly gory scenes there was some kpop song banging on the background or i dunno a Barbie doll song (im a barbie world in a plastic world whatever). 
This is what happens on the movie. Incredibly terrifing scenes where me as an spectator is listening to some soothing and cute song but what's happening on screen doesnt match this at all. 
There is such a massive ammount of bad stuff happening on the movie yet the songs never pair with those scenes properly. 
Why in the world when people are going to die im listening to some artist giving her ---% in a cute song like everything was okay? 
It's insulting. I'm a human watching this. I'm being shown that bad stuff is going to happen. 
I'm not supposed to smile when bad stuff happens... what the hell Makoto Shinkai? 
Characters: One word. Inconceivable. Even to anime standards. 
The characters are so dumb and fake that they take you away from enjoying the ride. 
Their reactions are so incredibly cliche. Unless you were born yesterday there is absolutely no way that you can be surprised by their answers or reactions. 
The main cast is so poorly written and their horrible voice acting doesnt help (there are a few screams here and there but it feels like they were playing some online game at - AM so they cant rise their voice or their parents will scold them... what the hell? Scream harder! It is so infuriating.). 
A few of the characters reaction seem to point out at new side stories but they never go anywhere. The thing is that this movie last almost - hours but the actual movie lasts for -- mins at best so its not like there was no extra time to be spent into polishing the main story or presenting the side stories or doing anything.  
There is a massive ammount of ""wasted"" screen time (im not complaining about a few scenes here and there showing the scenery but jesus christ i almost fell asleep a few times for how predictable or slow everything was going. I even considered playing Pokemon on my phone a couple of times since absolutely nothing that was being shown on screen was surprising me, not even a tiny bit). 
Enjoyment: If the movie lasted for i dunno - hour i could have enjoyed it a little bit more. 
I want the time i wasted watching this mess back. There was absolutely nothing that i enjoyed of this movie. 
Well i liked the few scenes where we see the kitchen of a restaurant but i work at one so im pretty sure that was the reason. 
Don't waste your time. 
Final thougts: I cant think of nothing that makes this movie worth watching. 
It's not sad, it cant evoke my feelings (""When this is going to get good?"" doesnt count) nor it can make me cry (it's not hard! In less than - minutes a show like i dunno BNHA with no build up whatsoever was able to make me cry twice. So it's not like you need a shit ton of time building a house of cards to make me feel sad). 
I feel that this could have worked better as an anime and a movie cannot properly present the story (that is not good on any level but at the very least it could have been properly shown right?). 
The songs felt so unnecesary --% of the time and from that % a big chunk could be classified as insulting. 
Even the damn SAO the worst story ever made wasnt as poorly written as Kimi no Na wa. 
I'm comparing SAO to Kimi no Na wa? Yeah 
Well what more do you expect from this review... i really wanted to like this. Seriously. 
But it was a complete waste of time. 
edit Afterthoughts: I might sound like im deeply concerned about originality when it comes to stories but that couldnt be more wrong. 
If a story is well written and well presented it doesnt matter if its originality its crap. 
I love Black Clover and that show is a lot of things but original. I feel like i had the necesity to point this on the end. Originality is never a problem when i look at some anime. When something its unoriginal and absolute garbage then it's like it adds salt to the wound but thats pretty much it. 
Kimi no Na wa is terrible but being unoriginal just makes the story it tries to tell even worse.

You know, it's one thing to go into a show expecting something it to be good.  It's another thing to go into a P.A. Works show and expecting it to be good.  Over the years, P.A. Works have shown us that despite having good animation and interesting ideas, you won't always end up with a good show and meaningful characters.  And so, after -- years of churning out what are mostly original anime (which is honestly quite impressive given how original anime are such a rarity these days), we have Kuromukuro or 'Black Relic', another mistake made by P.A. Works which is another case of ""Cool idea, terrible execution."" 
Story: Shiragane Yukina is your typical high school student with a mother who works in a high tech research facility that produces mechs and studies this giant cube-like object that no one yet understands.  Upon what basically equates touching the cube, they find that inside the cube is a man who bears the personality and loyalty of a medieval Japan period samurai who quickly mistakes Yukina for someone else, tells her about the 'demons' that threaten the world, and bring her to co-pilot a giant mech that they call the 'Kuromukuro'.  (Hey look, title drop.) 
What started out as a mech series with elements of mystery due to the gradual feeding of details and story over the entire -- episode runtime of the series quickly becomes one of the most boring and poorly written series that P.A. Works has made right up there with Glasslip.  The plot of Kuromukuro just has no sense of urgency and as a result, spends most of its time focusing on other ridiculous sideplots than the threat of the world.  Rather than saving the world or learning how to pilot the mech, we instead get stuck with a hotsprings episode, the school festival, making a movie, and all sorts of random shenanigans that have little to no place in a story focused on saving the world from the destruction of aliens!  It seemed like the show cared more about trying to be a slice of life anime with mecha elements rather than a mecha show with slice of life elements.  There's also the whole romantic sideplot between the two main characters which actually doesn't make if any sense when you put it in perspective.  The show just kinda threw them together to make the two seem important when in reality, these two characters barely do anything at all.  This squandering plagues the entire run of the series and puts it in a place where it has a confused identity, dooming the series with its lack of cohesiveness.   
So when you throw away all of the sideplot/slice of life garbage that the show tries to implement, what exactly do you get in the end?  The action and mech focus while considered as the main plot of the series doesn't bear fruit in the way you would expect it to.  (Plus, it's only like...--% of the entire show.)  Very little of the show is truly mechs sword fighting since the majority of this time is devoted to exposition, more exposition, and even more exposition which is kinda weird considering that the aliens or 'Efidolg' as they call themselves have the generic ""Take over the world plan"" which...doesn't do the show any favors.  It's a very overused kind of plotline than when revealed, is kind of depressing to see since you sort of assume that there's something more to it when presented...but no, it's just ""Take over stuff.  Muahahaha!""  It doesn't help that the main characters have plot armor so thick that not even a complete alien takeover where literally everyone, protagonists included, are stuck helpless just waiting to be absorbed into the Efidolg's empire, thus making the entire struggle completely meaningless cause you know they'll never die.  Not only that, but the show has a few mystery elements that it tries to shove in there like mysterious disappearances and whatever that when revealed, don't actually have much impact on the story overall.  On paper they sounded good, but putting them into practice once again doesn't do any favors because of how unimportant the show made it sound. 
Pacing is also a huge leader in Kuromukuro's downfall and possibly why I cracked my table when watching the final episode.  The show is never even and it never wants to get to the good stuff or stay at the good stuff.  During the random bullsh*t, the show is at its most lethargic, spanning an entire episode or episodes focusing on an event that doesn't have in any way have to do with the main plot, before speeding up like a madman to get through the action/plot-relevant bits so that it can go back to its happy-go-lucky annoyances called side characters.  The finale especially is the biggest offender of this because it's by this point in time that P.A. Works realized that they wasted so much time before that they have only ~-- minutes to shove in a timeskip, a reconciliation, more exposition to explain what is going to happen, and a mini fight that scratches more heads than earns smiles because of the quality of its open ending where really nothing gets resolved. 
P.A. Works's attempt to celebrate their --th year anniversary created a mess of a show that focused on the wrong things, had very generic conflict, and a love story that doesn't make sense due to how forced everything was.  The end result was a generic mech show that created more problems than it could solve, and a very disappointed reviewer who still prays to see a show as good as Shirobako or characters are good as Charlotte from a P.A. Works show again. 
Overview: 
-  Wasted too much screentime on slice of life 
-  Main plot was put on the back-burner 
-  Way too much exposition for a very generic plot 
-  Horrible pacing issues 
-  Several mystery parts with drab conclusions 
-  The most rushed ending I've ever seen 
Characters:  As a largely story-based show, the characters in Kuromukuro adhere to that by being puppets on the stage to do stuff in reaction to the current problem at hand.  As such, characters in Kuromukuro are far from deep with little to no character development for any of them. 
Why don't we start with Shiodome Miuna, I mean, Shiragane Yukina.  (Sorry, wrong series.  They just look so similar.) As the main heroine of this series, Yukina honestly doesn't do anything of value.  Her entire character is built around the idea that she's this meek little girl who eventually mans up and pilots the Kuromukuro along with the other main protagonist, but it really doesn't come to fruition.  Sure she's less whiny by the end of the series, but the only thing she really does is preach about wanting to save the world from the imminent threat that the show tells us about because ""lol, we ran out of screentime"".  She doesn't do anything of significance since other characters always drag her into things, creating a character that truly has no will of her own with a hint of damsel in distress that overall creates a character that I could give less than two sh*ts about.   
Then there's Ouma Tokisada Kennosuke, the -- year old samurai from medieval Japan encased in a giant cube and preserved until the modern day.  You know how it is.  He's a dude that holds onto old and tired values that in the modern day, don't really make sense, and is also inept at technology because he never had them and as such is surprised at the thought that you can talk to someone via a tiny box you hold up to your ear.  Chivalrous as he may be, that's about all you'll get out of Kennosuke.  His character is that of a generic samurai beholden to the master that he serves and destroy all the demons!  His values and what he holds dear eventually change as the series goes on, but the whole samurai aspect and samurai code that he lives and breathes is such a central part to his character that that's about the only thing that he has going for him.  Take that away and you're left with what equates to an empty husk that doesn't have any real purpose.   
And then there's Sophie.  Oh Sophie.  Why you're quoted as a main character, I don't know.  I chose to talk about her specifically because the show makes such a drastic attempt to make her relevant, important, and overall a half-decent character at the start with this underlying hate towards Yukina that I expected to get explained later on, to a half-baked character with a pension for samurai (that never gets explained) who has little to no importance in the grand scheme of things.  I think P.A. Works was trying to fulfill a quota by having a little girl pilot a giant robot or something, since Sophie's entire existence is just a way of creating some form of plot progression using her character. 
Villains are unsubstantial since they assume that the whole ""Sending down one person to deal with the threat"" is enough to fulfill the malicious plans that they have in store.  They're stupid, none of it really makes any sense, and they're all generic to a fault.   
As for side characters, we have the plot related side characters and the slice of life related side characters.  To save the worst for last, let's start with the former.  Want exposition?  The guys working at the facility got ya covered.  These guys really have no reason to do anything aside from being either a slight nuisance, or be there to feed information to the audience so we know what the hell is going on.  There're also apparently other countries that come in and have their own say/actions in this series, but it's so minuscule and lacking that they might as well have not done it in the first place. 
And then there're the slice of life characters.  Oh boy, where do I begin?  These are if not the most annoying characters in the series.  Sad part is?  You see them more often than any other member of the supporting cast.  The most prominent ones are Yukina's classmates which begs the question of ""Why are you friends with these people?""  You have Yukina's best friend who's a cosplayer and the supposed 'wingwoman' to the romantic subplot, you have the foreign guy who tries to get people to care about him by silently whining to himself when in reality, no one actually cares about him, the completely unnecessary other dude who adds nothing to the series aside from arrogance and a sad attempt at creating a love triangle that this show CLEARLY needed, and the annoying vlogger character who puts any and everyone in danger just so he can get footage for streams even when his life is on the line because clearly, your footage is more important than the dude's leg tendon that probably got cut when he jumped in and tried to save you from getting killed!  (You can probably tell who's my 'favorite'.)  The show shoves these nuisances in your face so many times that it downgrades the viewing experience as a whole.  They desperately try to get you to care about these horrible people which doesn't turn out very well because they're so unnecessary, the overall quality of the would increase dramatically if they weren't in there.   
Overview: 
-  Lacking main cast 
-  Generic and uninteresting villains 
-  Way too many exposition characters 
-  Terrible people do not a supporting cast make 
-  F**k you, Jundai.  (Hope you get your camera shoved down your throat and choke on it.) 
Art: The art is actually really lowbrow for what P.A. works generally produces.  While the designs and overall look of the series do seem like a P.A. works show, the quality is severely lacking.  Nothing really stands out which is a shame considering the company has Angel Beats, Nagiasu, and Charlotte under its belt, thus leaving me puzzled as to what happened to make this project not be as stellar as some of their previous works since the only word that can be described for it is ""average"". 
Though despite that, the worst offender for this show's artwork are the mechs that the series has.  They're produced in CGI and don't really mesh in too well with the series.  Most of the action is done via CGI robots as a mecha show might suggest (plus, it's probably cheaper), and all I can say for the overall look of the show is...eh.  Average really is the only word that can describe this and that's really a darn shame looking back because I really do like P.A.'s arstyle and quality. 
Overview: 
+/- Average artstyle 
-  Mechs don't mesh in too well tot he handdrawn background. 
Sound:  I don't really care much for these tracks honestly.  All of them are pretty generic and not particularly worth the time to listen to, so in essence...skip'em.  Not worth the time. 
Personal Enjoyment:  It's pretty clear from the '-' rating and the rants sprinkled throughout the story and character sections that I LOATHE this show.  I've consistently been watching shows made by P.A. Works and I truly believe that the company has imaginative ideas and good enough animation to create something that's good quality overall.  But time and time again, I'm reminded that they go the other way instead and end up creating messes that beg the question ""How did this show end up this way?""  Kuromukuro was a show I went in without many expectations trying to see if P.A. Works would be able to make something half-decent again.  The very first episode didn't amuse me and every proceeding episode dragged the show down farther and farther and farther down the dreaded hole of P.A. failures next to Glasslip and Haruchika.  I hated watching this show, agonizing week after week until the final episode where the final letdown finally let me be free.  
Did I like this show? 
F**K NO!  The only thing that I could see as an upside to this gargantuan failure of a cohesive story is the fact that they animated a giant stone pillar crashing through a building that was represented as the main office building for P.A. Works.  That legitimately made me laugh and was probably a small apology for the amount of f**k ups that they have done. 
What didn't I like about this show? 
Everything.  Like legitimately, everything.  Especially you, vlogger boy.  You have literally no purpose in this series aside from being a gigantic prick.  Like seriously, who thought a completely unlikable character like that would be a good idea?! 
Would I recommend this series? 
No.  I would suggest you avoid this show like the plague.  It has really one-dimensional and lacking characters, wastes so much screentime that they're only about - proper fights in the entire series (each of which span roughly -/- of an episode only), all wrapped up in an incomplete bow where the main plot/threat isn't even solved in the end.  Happy --th anniversary, P.A. Works, see you next year when you inevitably waste another good idea.  (Please prove me wrong.)

hELP ME. 
Okay so... I've watched a lot of hentai in my day but... but this? This was disturbing. I like yoai normally but... the fact that one of these boys was prepubescent and thirsty was one of the most disturbing things I have encountered. 
The story... well.... nothing much. They just sort of met then had sex. 
The art was... actually good. I actually really like the art style and the way their hair was drawn. 
The sound was actually good too. Very well... hate to admit it but... it was kind of arousing. 
The characters were crap with this little prepubescent thirsty boy. 
My enjoyment.... well.... no. Just no. I truly hated this and I will never watch it again. Shouta and pedophilia disturbs me. 
Overall this is just... a bad choice on my part.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a fan of the manga, a fan of the anime or both. 
It’s exactly what you wanted. 
The wait for the -th installment in the long running Jojo’s franchise is over. Vento Aureo is here to give you one last bizarre adventure for the decade’s end, and it’s one hell of a journey. For those that aren’t caught up, as always, I suggest watching the ---- anime, Stardust Crusaders seasons - and -, and Diamond is Unbreakable in that order first and coming back here (Current season). However, for those who’ve done this song and dance before let’s dive in and find exactly what makes this season such a golden experience. 
The story of Golden Wind follows a youth by the name of Giorno Giovana and his dream to become a “gang-star”.  While stumbling his way into the group called Passione, he works to change the conglomerate at large from the inside out. Joining him on his quest are a crew of super-powered gang members just like himself with unique abilities of their own.  Now a faithful underling to the Capo Bruno, a major player who shares the same dream of reformation as Giorno, a deadly game of cat and mouse commences. Bruno and his team will face drug lords, criminals, and villains of the worst kind all to take out the leader of Passione itself and give peace back to the civilians. 
Now, just like with any Jojo’s storyline that sounds incredibly simple at first, but halfway through the series it becomes a lot deeper than that. I won’t spoil anything, but this season has some pretty heavy themes. The first couple of episodes are, if I’m being honest, very slow paced and do a lot of TELLING about the character’s pasts and don’t allow a lot of breathing room for them to grow along side Giorno. This is probably my only major complaint about this season, hell some characters just up and vanish. But I realized that’s what makes this chapter really powerful and truthfully, the darkest. In GW every situation feels as if it truly is life or death.  
The series really delves into the importance of preserving life; not just of the innocents that succumb to the evils of Passione’s drug ring, but comrades too, hell its basically Giorno’s power. Let’s just say if you were a fan of the Stardust Crusaders character Anne and those episodes, you’ll love this. This direction creates an honorable dynamic, a brotherhood and common goal among the group. From the word “go”, Golden Wind has its main characters constantly on the run, people brought together mostly through circumstance rather than actual want. I think this is where Golden Wind is at its most genius. The characters don’t get much down time so, you’ll only really see them connect by watching them survive together each episode, which is ultimately what brings them closer. When the chips are down, and all hope seems lost for the cast you’ll thank those backstories for giving you a reason to cheer these guys on.  
Outside of the story which is very well told I would say the strongest aspects of this season hands down are the art, animation and the soundtrack. This is easily the best-looking season of the franchise so far, hands down. That near two-year break after DiU’s completion was well worth the wait. DiU’s shortcomings in the art and animation department have only become more apparent with the release of its successor, taking your time always brings a better product and it really shows here. Every character, location, and action scene are crisp and never feels muddled or out of focus even when shots are at a distance. At times I feel the areas visited were stolen straight from a painting rather than digitally drawn, it looks that good. 
The soundtrack for this season is also, one of, if not the best offering the show has delivered. Fighting Gold and Traitor’s Requiem are on point and contenders for two of the best intros, not just because the songs are so good, but because of the accompanying visuals. While, some people might be disappointed they lost Gangster’s Paradise to a movie starring a blue hedgehog, Freekin’ You and Modern Crusaders are smooth, refined choices that really brings the --’s-esque style the series is going for to life. 
To wrap things up, as I have with all of them, I really enjoyed the latest season of Jojo’s. While I did find some of the choices questionable—many of the early episodes moved at a leisurely pace; many fights that felt extremely circumstantial or complex/oddly specific in nature just to have a “down to the wire” clutch scenario;—Those were just some of my own personal grievances. I still found myself hankering for a new episode with each cliffhanger. Things that worked about this series was the extremely likeable cast, the gripping story, the stand ideas—and that unforgettable and always hype piano number. If you haven’t seen it yet (or read it), Giorno’s path to conquering Passione is one bizarre adventure not to be missed. So, what are you waiting for? Go out and watch it, until next time. 
Arrivederci.

Why is this anime so great? Lemme tell you. 
Story - Beautiful. If you don't know yet, this is a boxing anime, and no its not just big bald buff men beating the shit out of each other, it is about a wimpy, innocent, bullied kid who falls in love with boxing and goes out to be a boxer. Having no friends, or hobbies, just spends his day helping his mom with her boating business it would only be natural such a weird kid to be bullied. The main character, Ippo, isn't weak, just afraid, he was saved one day by a boxing genius named Takamura and that's where his interest in boxing began, it wasn't merely the interest in boxing, but ""What does it mean to be strong?"" is how it started. Being trained under an amazing coach, he joins the boxing world making new friends as well as romances. This anime is filled with action, adult humor, and drama. 
Art - Art is very nice, especially great in the newer seasons. The drawing is done well, especially in the fighting, the way the air flies around during the movement, the way the sweat explodes, as well as the shininess and detail of the muscles. 
Sound - The opening songs are nice, they really know how to get you excited using the music, makes the hands on your arms stand. 
Characters - The main character is a typical wimpy character at first, very innocent, but later on he becomes strong while maintaining his innocence making it difficult to not like it. The side characters are very funny and very unique, the anime would not be good without them. 
Enjoyment - Starting from the first episode, it is very enjoyable. Watching him improve and fight is great. What really brings the anime together is the comedy, its not childish comedy that you would see in most anime, its hilarious adult like comedy. Very enjoyable.

""Nothing is as boring to tell as a story of succesful love""- Watashi. 
‏‏‎ Writing/Plot (-/--) 
‏The story is about Watashi, a college student who is obsessed with a rose-coloured campus life. But nevertheless, his friend Ozu- whom Watashi meets after being left apart by his clubmates, messes up Watashi's campus life dragging him to a lifestyle based on harming others' relationships. ‏‏‎For almost an episodic series, this is all I can ask for. Each episode shows a different story yet they are related with the hitherto episodes. Therefore, there are nods to other episodes in order to hint the philosophical message of the series. 
‏‏‎ Characters (--/--)  
‏‏‏‎ Watashi and Ozu are two of the most complex characters I have ever seen. ‏‏‎ ‏‏‎The nameless main character (Watashi) is, by far, the most developed character. Watashi shows up as a different person on each alternative story, suggesting how a person would change if his choices did so. Watashi's sick humour was orgasmic. Ozu is presented as evilness itself, but little by little the viewer is introduced into his life and gets to see how Ozu actually is, showing the humanization of a character who is perceived as a kind of evil übermensch. Last but not least, all the secondary characters show an outstanding development. Their personalities change on every alternative reality, indeed, all of them except Akashi have a different relationship with Watashi within each alternative story. 
Art (--/--) 
The synesthesic meaning of each colour and its simple yet beautiful art makes The Tatami Galaxy an anime to reach art perfection. It has a unique artstyle based on the japanese concept ""wabi-sabi""- It does not try to represent realistic or relatable drawings, its aim is to create beautyness in a parallel universe that transmits special and unique moods. ‏‏‎ ‏‏‎ In addition, there is symbolism in some chatacters' appearance. In the beginning, Ozu's face makes him look like a devil, but then his appearance becomes more simillar to a human's, corresponding the character's evolution.  
Sound (-/--) 
The OP and the ending song are just perfect. I did not skip any track. It drives into the suitable mood for the episode that is about to start. The ending song is one the best anime songs I have ever listened to- there is nothing I can complain about. Voice acting was really nice, especially Watashi's and Akashi's voice- their intonation seems flawless and clean. The OST relays a perfect mood at every moment. Its flaw is to leave so many parts with a simple OST or no OST at all during Watashi's monologues. 
Personal Enjoyment (--/--) 
The Tatami Galaxy was fun to watch and it is plenty of philosophy. This anime has a great rewatch value. After the first watch, you can focus more on drawings and voice acting.

Inuyasha is a great story based on the feudal era of japan. It is a great adventurous   
, action packed, love story where all the characters are always lively which keeps the mood of the story very up-beat. Many characters are introduced throughout the story which keep you stringed into the story, making it more long lasting. At times there are fights, laughs and even tears mainly dealing with the main characters: 
Inuyasha, Kagome, Miroku and Sango.  
The story, art and character were also great factors that made this series  
wonderful. The story is interesting and amazing because it deals with a young high school girl(Kagome) who goes back in time and ends up traveling with a half demon, a monk(Miroku) and a demon slayer(Sango). Although it has a great story most events may repeat themselves and at points there may be pointless events which occur and  
which slow the pace to the plot of the story because of this i did not rate the story 
as &quot;amazing&quot; as i wish it could be. The art was spectacular, each character was drawn great and the effects used in battles were tremendous. The characters within the story could have been better such as inuyasha which i think tempered most people especially because he is bound in a love triangle unable to choose the one he loves. The Story, art and characters of this story make it wonderful and enjoyfull which i fully admire. 
Inuyasha is a great story. It exploits many genres which makes it a great story  that anyone can love and admire. I have grown to love this series and so have my two elder brothers, anyone can watch it and love it thats what makes it so great!! So go ahead, it doesn't matter how old you are or what gender you are you can watch inuyasha and still love it!!!! =]

Oh hi there, just know that i'm writing this while waiting for my flight to an island with beautiful scenery and life-changer villagers, because that's how much Barakamon affected me. (Sorry if this review is mehh, but i'm trying to avoid giving any spoilers.)  
""You won't see any opportunities from below if you keep looking above your head all the time"" 
""Once you carve your path, all that's left is to walk it."" 
Sometimes, life isn't always the way you want it to be, and that's what makes life worth living. Watching this series, i cannot stop thinking about the beautiful hidden messages that lie within every episode. Slice-of-life anime has always been my favorite, and Barakamon, you're gonna stay in my list for a long period of time big boy.  
Punching the calligraphy  director - being sent to an island by his father - coping with the different lifestyle than in Tokyo. Pretty much the whole summary of Barakamon. Simple right ? That simplicity is what makes the whole story so interesting to watch. When i watch any anime, i don't really like to finish all the episodes in one day because i feel that, the longer time it takes for me to finish a series, the more connection i feel with the characters, simply because i look forward to it. ( yes, even though there are just -- episodes. i know i'm a little weird).  
Handa is a very lovable character. He feels so low about everything except when it comes to writing calligraphy that he felt the need to punch an old director for criticizing his work, (not very lovable now doesn't he), but he started to show his true bright color throughout the series especially after meeting Naru, Hina, Tamako, Miwa and Hiro, and you know what, i love this guy. Despite his serious looking face, he has deep thoughts about everything, wisdom quotes that he said to himself, leaving him utterly embarrassed after noticing that he was heard by Naru and others. 
There are times when i just want to curl up in bed, in awe of everything that happened, and sometimes i laugh at the stupid jokes, not because i think they're funny, but because of how much i can relate to those. (They are funny actually) And nope, not a single tear was shed, but i do feel my heart fluttered with happiness and other kind of feels i cannot explain, i'm not too good with words, but have you ever felt happy over small little things and everything is just great, yeah, that kind of feels.  
If you're looking for a feel good, heartwarming, inspiring anime, give it a try.  
I can't help but smile when watching the entire series. The OP and ED are so good i didn't skip any of them during those short but sweet -- long episodes. 
Season - ? Yes please ! And there goes my informal review.  
oops, they're already announcing my flight. Ja ne !

Now that the English dubbed version of this anime is soon to come out, I should probably write a review of it.  That said, this review is of the _subtitled version_ of this anime. 
I hope anyone reading this will at least try this anime - it's a delight and one of the few shows that I watch over and over again.  There is no single part of it that I don't treasure - and not a single character I don't like.  It's wonderful! 
The story is probably the part I like the most.  It's got a credible and sympathetic female lead that finds herself without a home or income.  She's quite ordinary except for her incredible fearlessness and her ability to remain positive despite a very difficult childhood.  The tale of how she meets and falls in love with the male lead; a brusque, snarky fox yokai that works as a 'familiar' for the local land god, is precious.   
You can read the summary of the story for yourself, but it can't express the charm and chemistry of the two main characters' relationship.  Tomoe is most decidedly 'fox-like' in his aloofness and snark, but Nanami's bright personality gets to him anyway.  Nanami, who, it seems, has never been able to rely on anyone, falls for Tomoe's strength and incongruous-seeming concern for her despite his repeated assertion that yokai and humans can't fall in love with one another. 
The main characters grow and mature even over the short span of -- episodes and you end up cheering for them. Side characters are charming, well crafted and add to the story perfectly.  The anime is beautifully drawn with the perfect style to suit the story, a lovely pallet that's just a little misty at the edges - not too artsy, ethereal or saccharine but sweet and grounded.  The musical score is bright and charming and suits the story too; nothing that memorable - it just blends into the mood overall - which is probably the best thing it could do! 
I like the pacing - it doesn't have any slow spots, keeps the viewer engaged and following the story without having too many redundancies or making assumptions that the viewer will understand something that a foreign viewer might not.  I really appreciate that!  It translates very well to an American audience, or at least everyone I've ever shown it to has felt so, and I am so pleased to see it coming out dubbed.  
After all these positives, I tried to think of some negatives, but nothing immediately comes to mind.  It’s too short – IMHO – and there’s lots more interesting stuff past the thirteen episodes and one OVA in the manga if they ever wanted to do a season -, but that’s really all the criticism I could think of for this program.  It’s lovely and one of my few ‘MUST SEE’ animes.

Do you like ghosts? How about ghost encounters? Then this is the anime for you. I am grateful to see this anime a while back. Don't let the first case fool you. It will get better at Episode -. Yes as fast as that. I have no words to describe this hidden masterpiece gem. Wish me luck. 
The story starts in a not so good opening of an anime. You will think that maybe I'm just wasting my time. Boy, you are WRONG!!!! It will be the biggest mistake of your life. Don't call yourself as an otaku if you haven't seen this. The story, as I said earlier, it is fast-paced, entertaining and fun to watch. It's that good. The character development is good. The characters are amazing in their own role. The mysteries are mind-blowing. Everything is almost perfect. It will keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end. After every case, you will start to think ""Next case pls"". 
The animation is not good today but it will make you adjust the quality of the animation after the second case. The comedy is also funny. The romance is also worth it and it is needed to keep you entertained. The scare factor is lacking. 
I wish it would have been longer and will have second season, Finger-crossed. Why we can't have more anime like this today? Watch this ASAP!!!!! Best to watch it at night.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - female edition 
That pretty much sums it up, basically it had a lot what made Gurren Lagann fun, just in smaller quantity, and like Gurren Lagann was a homage to super robot, this is a homage to magical girls. It fails to live up to Gurren Lagann but by itself it is still a good watch. 
Story - - 
There are a lot of twist and turns, but really if you focus on the plot, you are missing the point. The story makes a lot of parody of common tropes while playing other straight, the angsty teen MC, the revenge plot, ""Luke I am your mother"", etc. But let's be honest here, the plot is a fucking mess, in the end buried beneath the spectacle is a coming of age story for the female MC. 
But the same can be said about Gurren Lagann as well, which I also don't consider to have much of a plot that doesn't boil down to a coming of age. So the question is does the spectacle of Kill la Kill measure up to the spectacle of Gurren Lagann, Let's see, Gurren Lagann had multiple meaningful side character death on the MC side, so I'm going to say no. 
But in the end if you just want a spectacle plot, than Kill la Kill would satisfy your wants. 
Characters - - 
Let's talk about Kijin Sei...I mean Matoi Ryuuko (damn those two look similar, Trigger must have played DDC or else drunk minds think alike). She is a rebellious teen, with angsty issue (just like Seija), whose development flips back and forth (just like Seija), and her plotline ends kind of anti-climatic (just like Seija).  Fortunately for you Trigger, I like Seija a lot, so I'm willing to let Seija -.- slide for having a lot of personality defects that didn't get a proper rap up like Simon's did. And that's good cause there ARE a lot of problems that never rapped up, unlike Simon who is now old and passed the torch, Kill la Kill ended with a ""back to normal life"" where Ryuuko's development never got the old Simon rap up, so considering her back and forth development she might just flip again, and the development never come across as strong as Simon's did. 
Then there is Shinmyou...I mean Mako, who serves as the comic relief, which is good, cause if Kill la Kill took itself too serious than that would be a disaster, so I think she fits the tone of the series, by injecting a decent dose of stupid into the show. And as a character she balances Ryuuko's angst well enough. 
Senketsu is the mentor role, there isn't much to talk about him, he fits Kamina's role (including death). 
Now onto the villain and anti-hero 
Satsuki is the secondary protagonist, and her story is actually very interesting, her story-line of rebelling against her mother and relationship with the Four, paints a very solid background. In addition, her stern and more mature personality shows a great contrast to Ryuuko, making her stand-out the most in all of the characters. As a rival role, she is quite perfect, and there isn't much to say, pretty solid character as long as she isn't the MC. 
Nui is evil Mako. 
Ragyou is the villain, she fits the role of the anti-spiral, AKA, final boss, and that is her entire character schtick. ""Blow up the world"" is basically her motivation and target and basically everything defining her. There is a ""logic"" that she says, but it is too coo-coo to matter. Overall, she is the final boss, because we have to have a final boss. 
Everyone else have personlity and quirks and some background, but I feel that these background drown out Ryuuko's story rather helping it, so instead of having one very memorable character, we have a lot of slightly memorable characters all meshed together in to a bland mesh. 
Art, Music - -,- 
Like Gurren Lagann but cheaper, the music is better than Lagann, but the animation sometimes turn into PPT. 
Enjoyment - - 
Enjoyable time sink, hope that no one try this style ever again, it was fun the first time, okay the second time, and the third time would probably be a horrible mesh.

P.S. I swear Trigger played DDC, the similarities are uncanny.

The genre of adventure is quite common throughout the medium. Naturally, it goes hand in hand with fantasy, the most common being the one with a medieval style, to make it more attractive. As normal as it may seem, a story with a different management is always welcome. What brings us now is an anime that uses a different kind of fantasy to which we are accustomed and that is why its popularity was so great. Let's see if Made in Abyss took advantage of this factor or wasted the only thing that would give identity. 
What is Made in Abyss about? 
The Abyss is a place where explorers called Cave Raider enter to look for relics, which would become the treasures of the place, on the other hand, it is also home to huge and lethal creatures, without forgetting that when you climb you suffer the curse of the abyss, which It can be deadly These adventurers are divided into ranges determined by the color of their whistle, with whites the highest and red beginners. We will follow the life of Riko a girl who dreams of being a white whistle like her mother. During an exploration she suffers the attack of a monster and is saved by a strange robot child whom she will take with her and will name him Reg. From that moment the fate of both of them comes together to explore the great mysteries that the Abyss hides. 
A rhythm in accordance with the narrative 
The plot that will handle will be calm and slow. From the beginning you can see that it is taking its time, the presentation of the context together with the structure of the place is presented in an entertaining way because it does not use long explanations. Many things can be observed and will be constant throughout the story (like the curse). It maintains a calm rhythm, even in tense moments, you will never feel that it hurries the events to reach a conclusion, which is good because it does not break with the narrative that arises from the beginning, it has consistency from the beginning to the end. This, unfortunately, carries a problem at the end of the series, it does not close anything, ending with a brutal cliffhanger for all who followed the anime. It is true that leaves several things on the air to be explained in a second season, it is appreciated because they prevented it from contrasting with the beginning, but that must has been a kick to all those who waited each week for a chapter. The final decision is questionable and acceptable at the same time, on the one hand it leaves the anime as it started and, on the other hand, it keeps a constant narrative, this decision will be in a test of fire when the second season comes out, for now it will only remain as something negative with good points. 
The characters are a good addition to the plot because they maintain a nice charisma. Riko is a protagonist with a playful, energetic and impulsive personality, she will be constantly moving the plot so that events happen. Her development focuses on her ambitions to want to be like her mother, this desire is because she wants to see her at the bottom of the underworld (the bottom of the Abyss). Her motivations are concrete and, although a little weak in some situations, they create a sympathy with her to follow the story. The other protagonist is Reg, a robot without memory, despite his state, it maintains a minimum pleasant characterization. It may not be as expressive or developed as Riko, but neither is it a hindrance, it has relevance and its amnesia, for now, has not caused conveniences in the plot. The third relevant character is Nanachi, who, despite arriving in the last chapters, monopolizes attention. It may sound positive if not because it is the type of character whose main characteristic revolves around suffering. This is not a bad thing on its own, however, if it is the only thing that is presented of its development, it is when the inconveniences come. It can show other things, but everything will always come out of suffering. The characters are entertaining to follow, everyone has a good chemistry that makes them entertaining to see every time they interact, some may be more worked than others, although this does not take away how pleasant they are. 
When we talk about the world in which events take place we take a big factor of anime. The bases are well raised to expose you the range of possibilities that can develop as the plot progresses. These will be presented little by little using few explanations or in such case they are not so complicated to follow and they do not take so much time. This is a point in favor because being a series of adventure it would be a sin if they show a long talk instead of how the world works. Besides, there are several factors that imply a deeper story that will be gradually unveiled (hopefully). The world you have is colorful and fascinating to see, it is a pleasure to see it, especially when changing ecosystems because the differences are remarkable. 
There is a quite outstanding detail that caused many to talk about anime and that is what they showed in two chapters. There are two situations that attracted much attention and I am going to talk about them without giving spoilers. The first one (happened in chapter --), is understandable because throughout the anime there is mention of the consequences and dangers that one can face in the Abyss. I could go into consideration that the scene score more points in shock factor, but it really complements all the constant danger that the protagonists go through. Besides, the series never limited itself to show vomit, urine, skulls, excrement, light nudity or talk openly about their chances of dying, so the blood is not out of place. Then we have the second event in the last chapter, in this case I can not say that it has reason to exist or to be so crude. It is true that it happens to develop and deepen Nanachi, however, the victim is a character who is never told anything, she has so little time on screen that it is impossible to have any kind of sympathy making her scene be used to continue victimizing Nanachi . Only the first event works with the context of the series, however, the second was unnecessary and even morbid because of the crude way of showing it. They do not reach the degree to consider the anime gore, but it will raise several eyebrows to the people who see it. 
Complementing the setting 
In the technical section we can find an excellent job. In the first place, the scenarios and landscapes are incredible. The details in each place support immersion because each zone has its own identity. Each layer is unique avoiding falling into repetition, at the same time it has its own spectacularity. On the other hand, it is positive to see that children's designs deviate from the standard that anime normally has. They may not be completely unique and some are generic, but the main ones are different from the others. 
With the music we find an excellent work of setting. Each tune is consistent with the landscape and situations. It serves as a connection to the viewer to accentuate each scene, transmitting the correct emotions. Unfortunately, the opening and ending are not of the other world, they go according to the presented in each episode, however, really one would easily forget them. Music is only good on the soundtrack, you can even listen to it separately, while the rest is generic at best. 
An anime that manages to excel. 
Made in Abyss is a complicated anime to recommend. Its story is interesting because it poses an interesting scenario where the plot of a search maintains a quite unique fantasy tone. On the other hand, its end is a complete cliffhanger of which we do not know how many years it is going to take to see the continuation. Seeing it is a good idea if you do not have problems with an open end, it is true that the important thing is the way, but this they left it halfway. But I can say that you can see it with no fear, as it has a confirmed new season (with no date confirmed as today, March, -nd). For me this anime would be a -.-/--.

(This has been adapted from my reddit thread) 
Anime allows for many different combinations since what we view on-screen doesn't necessarily have to be ground to reality. In that regard, when you mix together cute girls riding in tanks, you get the anime known as Girls und Panzer. 
STORY 
Girls und Panzer stars Miporin, a young girl who just transferred to a new high school and, upon enrolling, she is enlisted into the ""Tankery"" elective due to her supposed background in the field. 
What I found the show did nicely was its world-building. They actually introduced some interesting concepts regarding the use of the tanks and the lore behind them. Much of the information regarding the tanks seemed to be at least legitimate or researched, and because of this, it allowed you to take its focus on the tanks seriously. As for Tankery, I felt that the ""game"" they created was well-thought out and explained nicely over the course of the show. 
Many of the episodes focus on the battles that occur instead of on any actual plot. However, when they do try to inject some drama, it feels rather forced and out of place. Perhaps the problem was mainly due to the overall upbeat nature of the show. It doesn't take itself overly seriously, but when it tries to, it does not do a very good job. 
Thematically, its main message is about how one goes about doing the thing they love. That is, everyone has their own style of doing things. I felt that the way they handled this was okay at best. I think the biggest problem is that the ""enemy"" in the show is never quite concrete enough in order for there to be any significant push-back. There is impending doom introduced later on in the series but it isn't tangible enough to feel like a threat to the characters and the plot overall. 
ANIMATION 
Surprisingly, the animation for the show is very good. 
Characters move fluidly and in detailed ways. The tanks, likewise, do not actually seem out of place even though they are CG. 
The show also did its best with cinematography, such as when placing the camera beneath the barrel of the tanks or from certain character perspectives. 
To be honest, the animation reminded me a lot of Highschool DxD; the show is generic looking but its animation is nicely done (for whatever reason). 
As for the art style, it was fine. It is nothing good nor bad, just satisfactory. I would have enjoyed more environments for the tank fights than given (less forests and more desert/swamp/mountainous), but the ones they showed were still fine (inner-city, snowy, etc.) 
CHARACTERS 
This show has a lot of characters. Because of this, many do not get much screen time at all. And along the same note, that means hardly any of them see actual character development. Because of this, you do not care much for the characters present. 
That being said, they are all very cute for who they are. While trope-y, you like the emotionless Reizei, the mother-like Isuzu, and boy-loving Saori, etc. Even the other minor characters, such as the girl who always has one eye shut or the ever studious hall monitor. Having a cast of over -- or even -- characters, there is bound to be something for everyone. 
All that being said, they do try to explore at least the main cast. Again, much of this development feels underwhelming and is lumped in with the melodrama that it tries to present. The problem with the show is that it really isn't looking to have complex characters at all. Its main focus is the girls fighting in tank battles. While I am perfectly fine with this, I still wish there would have been some meaningful growth with any of the cast. 
SOUND 
The OP and ED were too generic for my liking. 
However, the rest of the soundtrack was nicely done. This is mainly because of the ideas at play. That is, with the tanks and WW- aspects, the pieces of music incorporate drums and trumpets that very much remind you of war. The soundtrack does a nice job of setting the mood, and in that regard I applaud them for it. 
As for the voice acting, I found the roles to be fitting for the characters with no standout performances. 
ENJOYMENT 
This is a show that you really just watch to have a little bit of fun. The girls themselves are nothing like those from Monogatari or Nisekoi where they are either extremely well developed or incredibly likable. Instead, they are cute girls doing what they do best. And that is participating in a game that involves shooting tank missiles at one another. It can be funny at times and while the tension it stages is never overwhelming, they do a nice job of trying to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. 
When it comes to Girls und Panzer, if you are looking for deep characters or a compelling plot, then you are looking at the wrong show. However, if you just want to sit back, relax, and watch girls drive some tanks, then this is the one for you. 
SUMMARY 
Story: Fine, world-builds nicely but not much else 
Animation: Great, fluid character movements and well done tank battles 
Characters: Bad, cute girls but nothing more to them 
Sound: Fine, OP and ED forgettable but the soundtrack is not 
Enjoyment: Fine, cute girls plus tanks is somewhat fun to watch 
Final Score: -/--

Talk about a lifeless adaptation… While not aware of the games, I have watched a few videos about them and they are quite close to a standard D&D; campaign, full of knights, wizards, elves, and of course dragons. It felt quite typical but it surely wasn’t as blunt as this movie. There is simply very little going on and are presented in the most simple way possible. Every single event and character in it are closer to a fairy tale than a dark sword and sorcery adventure, so it fails to be attractive in both sides of the spectrum. Too violent for kids and too dumb for teenagers. 
So, the plot is about evil mages using an elf girl to order dragons to attack the main temple of their mortal enemies. The champions of the temple find out about this in time and attack while performing the ritual, seemingly preventing the invasion. But turns out there are traitors amongst them who try to frame the champions and resume the ritual. Hm, ok, nothing much. 
It sounds and plays out like a typical Hollywood action flick, and in all honesty it would better off being made there instead of Japan. The budget is quite poor and everything is animated with low resolution that makes it look like a cut scene from a mediocre videogame. Don’t let the cover picture fool you; the actual animation in it is quite simple and usually crude. The armours and the monsters look nice but the faces of the characters and their motions are just very fake-looking. Plus most backgrounds are hardly detailed. The explosions and the debris were awesome. 
Despite being animated in a three-dimensional way, the characters are all one-dimensional. You have this Saturday-morning cartoon villain mage, who is the leader only because he is the only one who can transform to a bird and escape while everybody else in his team is killed. You have this chick paladin (named Seeker in this setting) that runs around and kills stuff because she is pissed. You have this good mage tagging along as a comic relief. You have a cute elf girl which… um, doesn’t do anything other that spacing out. And you have a bunch of other cardboards that don’t even have a face if they are not important to the plot. Nobody seems to be anything beyond what he looks and any attempts to flesh them out by giving them a tragic past or making them traitors blinded on power later on doesn’t help one bit to make them more interesting. All because of the following reason. 
The script is written by a five year old, as everything happens in a most unrealistic and yet obvious way. The lead chick is like Super Girl, as she is able to take out hordes of mages and demons, while everybody else has a hard time not being stabbed by a nobody after a few sword swings. She even casually escapes perils, while wearing a mini skirt and her companion the mage is constantly able to have spies all over the place so to conveniently tell them what they need to know. Weird how everybody in the kingdom seems to know of the conspiracy. Everyone besides the elites in the temple, that is. And how nice of them to be talking about it so casually, as if it’s not important at all. Anyways, the whole story is basically the chick killing stuff, them someone giving her a hint, then she keeps killing more until another one starts to reveal stuff. In effect, the main characters in this movie do nothing but fighting and let NPCs to tell them everything, a thing which ruins any real tension since they don’t really figure out anything on their own. So basically you get this movie where the bad guys want to rule the world JUST BECAUSE and the heroine fights them because they killed her family and friends. All the rest are nothing but ephemeral dressing. 
So now you may be wondering if at least the action is worth to bother. And sadly, not even that means much. It’s not just the crude visuals, but also how most of the battle choreography is just random slashes and unimpressive fire attacks. Hell, there is blood spilling all over the place and yet it washes off like it’s nothing but tomato juice. I also never understood why everybody walks around in impractical huge armours that don’t protect you by even a knife stab. There are lots of huge monsters in it too but they are all casually killed by simply jumping on them and stabbing them in the neck with a short sword. And I love how the corpses magically disappear after the battle or how a whole army is watching from a high place yet never seems to notice a battle taking place a few meters below them, or dragons the size of a tower coming towards them until they are right next to them. 
It’s a completely lazily made film that will leave the action lovers indifferent and most likely make the fans of the games to once again never wish for anything they like to be adapted. 
And now for some excused scorings.

the lesson i think trying to be conveyed was we wish to be having fun/relaxing when we work. Always wishing today was Friday the last work day of the week. 
audio was annoying. 
The art was sub-par at best 
I pray you the audience adhere to my warnings of low ratings. No need for anyone else to suffer watching this terrible pieces. 
Characters: 
Poorly drawn

First off, Little Witch Academia is movie, which would make some people think it's a longer animation with a bigger story. Well, it sadly isn't but gives something back for its lack in length : quality. -- minutes is short to unfold a story that makes sense and that would keep the public interested, but still satisfied by the end of it. 
This movie does just that, yes it was short, but extremely enjoyable since the animation was incredible and the characters were charming from A to Z. It ends with something that doesn't make you feel empty inside, but more of a ""Well that was really adorable"". it would be sad to see a continuity to this if they would have to cut in the outstanding quality they've put into this movie. 
It is a must see for anyone who likes witches, magic or anything similar. And it's only -- minutes of pure pleasure for the eyes.

Mystery Total Score: --/--- 
-Art Style: --/-- 
For a ----/-- show, it holds up rather well by today's standards. It didn't feel dated at all, and I would believe you if you said that it came out in mid ----. For it's era, I would rate it as being a gorgeous film, but having been through the artistic masterpieces of Violet Evergarden and the newer Fate shows, I can't possibly give it full marks. 
-Animation: --/-- 
There was CG, but it was hardly noticeable, and when it was, it didn't feel out of place with the environment. Fight scenes feel well choreographed without the awkward cut-ins you see in modern cinema movies where you don't get to actually see the hit connect, and all-in-all the animation is acceptable by modern standards. Bring me back - years and I'd say it's pretty much a benchmark for good animation. 
-Storyline: --/-- 
On the surface, it's just your usual police action flick with your useless main heroine and useful main hero, fighting against some terrorist evildoer. However, go deeper and you'll find some underlying themes, such as the perception of free will; if a sentient AI system that runs the country deems your life to be run a specific way for your, your friends, and society's maximum benefit, will you truly live a fulfilling life? 
Truth be told, I'm not a literature buff, so when they brought up certain literary works which were meant to highlight the conflicting ideas between those that follow the Sibyl System and those that oppose it, I was slightly lost. I'm not the most scholarly, yet I understood that there were thought-provoking arguments being put across. It was not a simple matter of good versus evil or black versus white. If you're trying to vehemently support one side or the other, you'll surprisingly find yourself in a grey area, and that is why I found Psycho-Pass to be mesmerising. 
Yet, if I loved it so much, why didn't it get -- out of --? Well, I felt that the build-up to the ending was rather rushed and this may be because of poor pacing in the initial episodes (which many others have criticized before). It's still an enjoyable ride, to say the least, in comparison to lackluster popular shows such as Darling in the Franxx which had phenomenal build-up but a god-awful climax and ending. 
-Music: --/-- 
The music is absolutely fantastic. I could feel the energy being carried across by Ling Tosite Sigure and EGOIST which helped me be more immersed in the world of Psycho-Pass. It fits well with the futuristic and dark tones of the show, as can be seen where one of the ending's first lines mock the main heroine's ideals - ""It's like the fairy tale died a long time ago"". She's too naive and idealistic to a fault, but she does grow, which I will touch on in the next section. 
-Characters: --/-- 
I know the phrase ""the characters feel like real people"" has been overused, but I cannot stress this enough - no one feels like a perfect carbon copy of other characters from other shows. I like the dynamic between the main hero and the main villain, it felt very Death Note-esque; with both of them trying to outsmart each other. The main heroine doesn't remain a doormat forever, too. She gets mindbroken rather quickly but becomes an absolute badass which I liked. The supporting cast aren't just there as cannon fodder either - you grow to love them or at least understand them, and if not for the fact that Gen Urobutcher was directing, you would have assumed that they have plot armour, from the fact that so much effort was put into making these characters feel genuine.

If there was one word I could use to sum up my thoughts on the Eden of the east franchise, including the series and the films, it would be... 
OK. 
Just OK. 
Nothing AMAZING or OUTSTANDING and I don't think it's 'TEH GREATEST ANIME EVAR ZOMG!!!', but for what it's worth, it's good and if you were to watch it you would have a reasonably enjoyable experience. Why do I think this? Well, that's what you're reading the review for isn't it? 
Firstly, the story starts off with an interesting premise having main character, Akira Takizawa, standing naked in front of the white house with a gun in one hand and a weird looking phone in the other. And the mystery just expands from there, to terrorist attacks, government conspiracies, secret organisations etc. The plot is very interesting but sometimes it is hard to grasp what's going on with all the political talks and government babble. Furthermore, there are just certain parts of the plot that do not make any sense at ALL, but we'll get to that later. Don't get me wrong, the plot gets very intense and investing at certain points, however I always felt that the stakes sometimes weren't high enough. What I mean by that is that something very nerve-racking could be happening but afterwards nothing really makes the situation more dire. I would go into more detail about this but I don't want to give away spoilers and anyone who's watched the show will probably get what I'm talking about. 
Secondly, the characters. Ironically, I found the least interesting characters in the series to be the two main leads. Takizawa is the reckless airhead but has a plan and a good heart and Saki is the very normal girl thrown into these events because of Takizawa. They aren't bad characters, far from it, and their chemistry is very cute but I just find the side characters, specifically the workers for the Eden of the East company, to be much more interesting and fun to watch like Osugi (The one desperately pining for Saki) and Mi-tan (who's name is NOT Mi-tan!). All characters involved in the terrorist group are very interesting as well, though I wished some of them were given more back story. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, there is one character in the show that I legitimately did not like throughout the series, and that is Juiz. Juiz is the voice embedded in Takizawa's phone that can pretty much do anything as long as it costs less than -- billion Yen. The first obvious problem with her character here is the problem with any show that has a device that can theoretically do anything that the character wants; it completely shatters the tension of any situation as you know they can just use that device to get out of it. But I would be fine with that and just brush it aside if that was Juiz's only problem, but it's not. Sometimes, she states that doing certain(typically plot important) things are impossible as she cannot perform it under the money limit. Yet other times, she can do seemingly IMPOSSIBLE feats and they are completely within the price limit?! What kind of sh*t is that?! And to my knowledge, it is NEVER explained how she did these! If anyone knows the answer behind these then please let me know, because it just boggles my mind! 
Don't take this the wrong way, I'm not saying Juiz is a bad character personality wise, because she has a very memorable personality and gets a lot of funny lines and sarcastic remarks throughout the show. I'm just saying the way she is implemented into the story is honestly, really inconsistent and bad. 
Anyway, enough Juiz ranting, let's talk about the presentation. The art in this show can look beautiful a lot of the time. The city backdrops, as well as the streets at night just look gorgeous. It's shows like these that seriously make me want to go to Tokyo. The characters are also animated very well, though very average looking and nothing really outstanding. Th soundtrack is also pretty meh. The first opening song as well as the ending song are great, but I cannot really remember any of the background music or any other tracks. 
Finally, the dub is good. All the voices fit the characters well, but it isn't really anything too special. 
Overall, Eden of the East, as I said at the start, is OK. It has a lot of problems, Juiz being the main one for me, but you will most likely enjoy it if you ever decide to watch it. Give it a shot and see if you end up enjoying it more than I did.

This anime can be contriversial depending on how you view some parts of its story. However, I believe those parts of the story offer mature topics for the viewers, and I believe that is a good thing. Most of them revolve around the politics of this show. The other part of the story is obviously about Carole and Tuesday's progress in becoming a music artist. I believe both of them are handled very well. The story: - out of --. 
When it comes to art, different shows offer their own unique artistic styles. This show is exactly that. The show's unique artistic style makes it feel like this anime is produced outside of Japan. Though it's still Japanese. The Art: - out of -- 
Let's talk about sound. For been a music anime, the best parts, and obvious parts are its songs and music beats. However, there is a twist. All the songs are sung in English. At first, it can be weird. But, as you continue to watch the show you accept it because the songs are great. Almost every single song from this anime surprised me, and or moved me. The songs are easily the best part of this show. Sound: - out of -- 
The two main protagonists are relatable to some degree. Carole is an orphan from Earth that has a passion for music. She lives in a lower middle class/poor lifestyle. Tuesday is also passionate about music, and she is exactly the opposite of Carole. She has the money, mansion house, and rich lifestyle. However, she has a selfish and somewhat a dick mother. Her mother only cares about her own political gain, and nothing else. Her older brother Spencer is the opposite. He is a caring person for his family and represents the good person in Politics. There are a whole bunch more characters that just serve the story. Characters: - out of -- 
My enjoyment as been very positive. The music and maturity of the story are the best part of this anime. Animes like Demon Slayer, and other over-hyped anime are damaging animes like Carole and Tuesday, Omaiden in You Savage Season and more. These animes put the story over everything else. That is why I believe this anime is worth a watch, and I highly recommend it.

Another great season of the show. 
Once again, the stories were consistently interesting. One thing that sticks out about this season is that it had a significantly darker tone than the prior two seasons, with new characters Haruka/Sailor Uranus and Michiru/Sailor Neptune being much more morally ambiguous than other characters in the show, and the whole situation with Hotaru/Sailor Saturn as well. This largely worked to the show's benefit, providing a lot of great episodes. The only flaw is that sometimes the monsters-of-the-week plots largely followed a formula, but it was a good formula which they got good mileage out of, and I didn't really get bored by it. 
The other factors that made the past seasons good were good here as well. The action scenes remained exciting and tense when they were used, the show remained great at delivering humorous or emotional moments (the latter especially was shown well thanks to the season's darker tone), and the art and animation looked very nice. The characters remained good too, as in particular Haruka is one of my favorites in the show. 
And once again, there were several episodes that put it all together and knocked it out of the park, culminating in the stunning climax episode.  
Overall, a great season of the show. Anyone who liked the first two should definitely watch this.

It's very rare that I come across anything that I can actually say is hard to review. Being an avid gamer, and maintaining a review blog I have much experience doing it, and it's never really tough to find a flaw in something. As far as anime goes, I'm a fan of just over a month now. In this time I've seen -- different shows, the most prolific thus far being Chobits. Since I finished watching it I've searched and searched for anything that could move me the way it did, but couldn't find it, not even in Clannad, something all my friends couldn't believe. 
And then ef: A Tale of Memories happened. 
ef: A Tale of Memories tells two stories at once one of Hiro and his love triangle involving his childhood friend Kei and a girl he stumbles upon Christmas Eve and winds up spending the day with named Miyako, and the story of Renji and Chihori, a girl who suffered an injury from a car accident at the age of -- that causes her to forget all her memories from -- hours ago.  
I'll get this out of the way right now; Hiro's story is nowhere near as touching as Renji's. That's not to say it isn't good, and perhaps to some it may be just as good, but I just couldn't connect with the characters on that end. The outcome to it just didn't seem to go the way it felt like it should have, and both Miyako and Kei felt somewhat immature and unprepared for a relationship. 
Renji's story however, is an awe inspiring masterpiece. It's difficult to really point out what makes their tale so incredible; there are so many ways. It sounds so cliche to say, I know, but for the first time in a review, I honestly can't point it out. Renji's strength and determination to stick with Chihori despite her condition is inspiring. Equally so is Chihori's desire to keep Renji in her thoughts; constantly re-reading her diary entries of him in order to not forget him, to the point that she passes out from sleep deprivation. And those are just two of the things that left a strong impression on me; rest assured, the whole of their story is unbelievably heartwarming and at times, tragic. 
Assisting both of the stories is the absolute best animation I've seen thus far. What makes ef's art so breathtaking isn't simply in character or environment design (which is still better than both Clannad series in my opinion). The show will often change contrast or camera angles multiple times during a scene to go along with what a character is saying. In a flashback scene describing Miyako's past as a child, the color scheme is switched to pastels and made to look as though it was colored in crayon. 
While I wasn't particularly impressed with Hiro's story, it is where you see these types of scenes and effects the most, and they're incrediibly powerful. One of my favorites was a particularly emotional scene in which Miyako is leaving messages on Hiro's cell phone as she gets stood up by him. It's simply a white screen with a simple picture of her sitting there. As you hear the messages she's leaving you can hear the pain and anxiety in her voice increase with each one. Each message is written on the screen as she says it, causing it to gradually fill up the screen with text, each message adding to the chaos, mirroring her mental state during each message. Simply amazing.  
As far as sound goes, voice acting is very well done, though that only goes for the English dub; I don't do subtitles. Music is good as well, but I honestly feel having the English version of the opening theme ""euphoric field"" was a mistake. There are multiple ending themes, but honestly none really stood out for me. 
What did impress me though was the use of sound and audio effects throughout the show. Much like the various visual effects that were used, sound is also changed up and tweaked in order to reflect the mood of the moment. It's not as powerful or moving as the visuals, but they still contribute to the unique feel of the series. 
Lastly, we have the characters. Much like the story, the characters in Renji and Chihiro's half are a little more likeable, though oddly enough, I feel the characters' backstories are done better in Hiro's story. My main issue is that Hiro, Miyako, and Kei all feel somewhat shallow and generic in comparison to Chihiro. I'll admit  Hiro being a successful Manga writer before even finishing high school is kind of interesting, and Miyako's turbulent past with her parents is sad. But it's really tough to compare to Chihiro's backstory, which is one of the best I've ever encountered, if not the absolute best. After witnessing all the pain and suffering she's endured through her life, it's hard not to feel a sense of elation when real, pure happiness befell her. 
I don't know if I would say ef: A Tale of Memories is better than Chobits I know that might seem blasphemous to most, but my reasons for adoring Chobits as much as I do are for another time. Suffice to say that ef is right there next to it on my favorite anime list. There isn't a single thing I won't remember here; the moving story, incredibe visual and audio effects, the endearing characters. All of it is a breathtaking experience, one that anyone, not just anime fans, needs to experience.

In Loving memory of those who died in the --th March ---- Tsunami tragedy. 
(Note to people, I'm not making a joke out of this review as I do with my other reviews) 
So yeah, it's the latest news everyone is currently talking about. However since I'm not in Japan but I do want to have a feeling of empathy towards them so I decided to continue watching this series after dropping it. And I agree this is the best time to watch it (for those who have not) to get a feel of the situation 
Tokyo Magnitude -.- is something unconventional. So you've seen before an anime service about zombie outbreaks but how about something nearer to the fine line of reality? Sure, the story takes place in Tokyo whereas the current circumstances takes place in the north-eastern area of Japan, and based on this story, it was an -.- magnitude, whereas in reality this one is WAY bigger, a scale of -.-. A natural disaster is always best told through the perspective of the -st person rather than reported by the news network, which is what this anime is all about. 
Of course who would want to see their beloved land of the creation of animes and manga to be destroyed (though a lot of trolls and haters would joke about it) this is no laughing matter. 
The story centers on three individuals as they try to live their best in their state of despair. Kusakabe Mari, Onozawa Mirai, and Onozawa Yuuki, three distinctive characters but with the same goal of returning to their families after enduring the tragedy. What holds before them is nowhere near anyone's guesses. What the anime have given us is a sense of realism. There's no macho superhero here to save them all. All you get is an everyday people, with their everyday life, trying to cope with what is in stored for them. I wont spoil further into the story as this is something you must experience for yourself. The first few episodes may be slow but it picks up fast during the climax of the story. 
I have heard criticisms and experience first hand the artwork of this anime. Although I much impress by the production of the CGI, there were other parts that needs serious amendments. The scene where countless of buildings are destroyed in an instant (not to mention the destruction daily routine of an average person) would send chills in your spines. 
Music is mediocre but blends in well with the scenario. The voice actors for each character brings out their true nature in the series. Their passionate voices during emotional scenes would send heart throbs throughout me during the course of the entire series. 
Though I would prefer a shorter or movie version of this anime, eleven episodes may tend to drag the story longer than it is needed. As I've said before, the story only started to get interesting nearing the ending. (But that doesn't mean you should just go skip it till the ending) Still it was enjoyable to watch nevertheless. No matter who's power you believe was responsible for this destruction, (God, mother nature, or even humans themselves) it gives us time to ponder, are we doing anything beneficial with our lives right now? Why are we wasting time reading manga and watching anime when disaster could strike anytime? Now you have a reason! To support back the rebuilding of Japan. Thus, don't only stop at watching free anime on streaming tubes, go buy yourself an original copy of the DVD!

Magic Tree House is an American fantasy series by Mary Pope Osborne. The books have done very well, having been translated into over thirty languages. In ----, Ajia-do animation works produced the first film based on the series. I'll be completely honest, I haven't read these books. I'm not going to know if the film version stays true to the original. I'll be looking purely at how well it stands on its own. With that in mind, let's take a look at Magic Tree House. 
Story: 
We open with a sorceress helping some children in a library. Once they're on their way out she's attacked by a mysterious wizard and turned into a mouse. We cut to a more recognisable world where our heroes, Jack & Annie experience an incident at school involving chasing a frog. Apparently their teachers are very bad at maintaining order. On their way home, the two stumble across a tree house filled with books that can take them through time and space based on where they want to go from the books. They discover that there are four hidden medallions that they can find to make a miracle happen. While in pursuit of the second they encounter Morgan Le Fay, who tells them of her troubles and enlists their aid. Can they find the medallions and return Morgan's powers? 
The big failing of the narrative is that their visits to the various locations while they're searching for the medallions aren't that interesting. Most of them involve the kids wandering around, locating the medallion and getting chased by something. It gets pretty repetitive for a film that doesn't even run for two hours. There's also a lot of bluster surrounding whether or not Jack will play Romeo in a play but there's no reason to get invested in it since there are no real stakes to whether or not he does. Really, the whole thing amounts to a kind of heavy-handed illustration of his whole character arc and how he's learning to be more adventurous. There's also the whole de-powering and transformation of Morgan that kick off the adventure. The most intriguing narrative aspect throughout is wondering why. When the answer does come out it's a big let-down. 
That being said, the whole concept is a good one. The disparate settings are also interesting, even though most of them follow the same basic formula. 
Characters: 
The cast doesn't have that much to them. Annie is adventurous. Her brother is more reserved and bookish. They're character types we've seen before but there's nothing really wrong with the portrayals here. 
Art: 
The artwork is a bit mixed. I'll use the dinosaur setting as the big example. When they travel to the world of dinosaurs the flora looks good, the scope is grand and the dinosaurs themselves look like they didn't have much effort put into them. Even ignoring the fact that they forgot the feathers, the dinosaurs have blank looks and just look like they were drawn in five minutes. The same holds up throughout the film. You have some stuff that's nicely detailed and others where the art team doesn't seem to have tried. 
Sound: 
The acting is perfectly passable. The kids are voiced by Ashida Mana & Kitagawa Keiko. They aren't the best performances but there's also nothing really wrong with them. I could say the same basic thing about the music. It's fine. 
Ho-yay: 
There isn't any, nor would I expect a children's film to have any. 
Final Thoughts: 
That's Magic Tree House. How does it hold up? Well, I can't call it a good film. There are much better out there, including films made for children. That being said, I also wouldn't call it bad. In terms of kids' films it's pretty average. While it has an interesting concept and the visuals can look nice at times, the story is also kind of dull. The characters are over-used tropes and there are just a lot of points where they decided not to bother putting in much effort. My final rating is going to be a -/--. Tomorrow I'll continue film festival week with Hanare Toride no Yonna.

Overview: 
It is time I take a short reprieve from reviewing actually acclaimed anime and go back to my little niche on this site, reviewing old CRAP! 
Background: 
The first Pokemon movie brings to the big screen what was easily the most interesting sub-plot of the -st generation of pokemon games, the creation of Mewtwo. The game and anime adaptation leave many hints and clues that foreshadow events in the movie and built up anticipation. In the original games on Cinnebar Island, there is a building that is filled with documents about attempts to clone Mew and create an all powerful Pokemon for Team Rocket. Throughout the game, you run into Team Rocket committing various crimes that only make sense when you consider that their goal was controlling Mewtwo. The reason that Team Rocket invaded Silph Co? They wanted the master ball to capture Mewtwo. The reason they invaded Lavender Town and want a pare of goggles that allow people to see ghosts? They want to capture ghost pokemon, because ghosts are effective against psychic types like Mewtwo. When you finally capture Mewtwo in gen -, he was the most unfairly OP Pokemon in any game of the franchise! Since Psychic type was already unfairly strong in gen -, Mewtwo was basically unstoppable with the move Psychic able to --shot everything in the game!  The anime even shows a preview of Mewtwo by having him beat the living shit out of Gary Motherfucking Oak! This is the guy that won -- gym badges in Kanto and at age -- had a team of cheerleaders and a corvette! By having Gary basically job to Mewtwo, this built up his status to insane levels of hype in the eyes of young anime fans, myself included! 
Story: 
SPOILERS! 
I must first mention that there is a huge difference between the Japanese version and the English version brought to you by our friends at -kids! The Japanese version features a -- minute origin for Mewtwo that not only establishes his motives much more clearly, but even sets up the seemingly random and bullshit Pokemon crying scene at the movie's end. Not only that, but from an objective and purely artistic viewpoint...it is by FAR the best part of the entire movie! How did -kids handle the scene? The motherfuckers cut it from the movie! They even dubbed it into English and had it all ready to go, but they left it out because...I guess because it was sad? I honestly have no idea.  
A scientist is working for Team Rocket's leader Geovanni and attempting to create a more powerful clone of Mew that will be strong enough to conquer the world. However, the scientist is only interested in using some of the money Team Rocket has given him to try bring his deceased daughter back to life. As an inside reference to Japanese audiences, the scientist is drawn to look exactly like the scientist Tenma from the original Astro Boy, who was also trying to resurrect his child with science. Mewtwo communicates telepathically with the comatose clone girl and she tells him that he can talk unlike other Pokemon and stands equal with humans. She herself doesn't know if she is a human or Pokemon, but dismisses this question as ultimately irrelevant because all life is precious. However, the girl's body is unstable and she begins to dissolve. This is emotionally devastating to Mewtwo, but her last words to Mewtwo are begging him not to cry and instead to cherish life while he has it. She also mentions the power within the tears of Pokemon, since they are special creatures. The girl then tragically dies along with all the other attempts at making clone Pokemon, leaving Mewtwo completely isolated and filled with a deep sadness and loneliness. 
Now to begin the story where the English version actually starts. Mewtwo is born in a lab and is disgusted that humans are treating him as a mere lab rat and experiment despite his intelligence being above theirs. Mewtwo kills all of the scientists in a rage, but then meets Geovanni, who initially offers a partnership and insinuates that he will treat Mewtwo as an equal. However, after showing a training montage of Mewtwo's time at Geovanni's Gym, it becomes apparant to Mewtwo that Geovanni isn't any better than the scientists. Mewtwo decides to blow up the gym and return to the island where he was born. Once back on the island, Mewtwo develops a nefarious scheme to capture the world's strongest pokemon and create an army of clones. Then he will wipe out all human life along with any pokemon that don't bow before him as the God of all Pokemon. The movie then cuts to our favorite complete loser Ash, who wins a trainer battle by --hitting a Donphan with a grass move and using a thunderbolt to defeat ground types. Yet after almost -- years he can't even make it to the finals of the League Championship, let alone win! Ash receives an invitation by Mewtwo to go to his island since Mewtwo considered Ash a strong enough trainer to want clones of his pokemon. Wait, I thought Mewtwo was supposed to be intelligent! Without any hesitation and despite an ominous storm brewing, our idiot hero sets out to the island with Team Rocket, whom OF COURSE he somehow fails to recognize! Mewtwo makes clones of all the pokemanz and these clones battle against their natural born counterparts. Ash of course fails to stop Mewtwo, but after getting killed trying to stop Mewtwo from fighting Mew, the pokemon start crying and this brings Ash back to life. Mewtwo then realizes the folly of his ways and buggers off! Of course, Mewtwo decided to erase everyone's memories so that Ash will stay ignorant and never learn anything...EVER! The End 
Art:  
Although anime movies always look much better than series and especially longrunning series, I have to give the Pokemon Movie some credit. For ----, this actually looked really good and even today this movie looks awesome compared to many anime airing in ----. The entire movie looks WAY better than any episode of Dragonball Super! 
Music: 
Once again, there is a big difference between the Japanese OST and the -kids version. Honestly, neither are amazing, but not bad either. The music definitely takes a backseat to the animation in this movie. 
Overall: 
Considering this was a children's movie based on a videogame and a rather mediocre anime, it actually wasn't too bad! The animation is excellent relative to other anime of its time, the battles are the most brutally intense of anything Pokemon has ever done, and the original Japanese version featured heart touching scene was actually sort of....good! The story borrows heavily from Frankenstein and although any level of profundity is blatantly stolen from there, that still isn't too bad considering this is Pokemon we are dealing with! I wish Digimon had the brains to borrow from classic Victorian Gothic literature instead of just being shit! If you are Pokemon fan, but perhaps grew up with Gen - and aren't old enough to remember this movie, I would actually recommend checking it out. You could certainly do worse.

I love Danganronpa, but the Hope Arc seemingly throws everything I love about the series on the floor and stomps on it - times and all because of one issue: Despite the series heavily influencing viewers to believe that death is final, this arc seemingly resurrects people from the dead for a fairy tale like ending. In the Danganronpa games, people die to serve a meaningful purpose. So what would have possibly been the 'trigger' for the author to do otherwise and consequently ruin the brilliance of the games? Let us investigate. 
If you have played Danganronpa -, you would know that the killing school trip, is well... exactly what it means. The students of the --th Hopes Peak Academy class are murdered by each other. However, their deaths motivate the main character to seek justice by uncovering the culprit and the ultimately the mastermind. Such a cause fabricates suspense and tension and thus generating excitement. But what if.. What if I told you that none of the students that 'die' actually die? You would probably feel a bit cheated and annoyed right? Well as would I, because that's essentially what the Hope Arc tells us; death is not as it seems.  
""That -- hours you spent playing that game I made? Forget it, because none of that matters now"" 
Simply stated, the author couldn't be bothered spending another episode explaining what happens after the game and instead decides to resurrect everyone that died, chuck em in the crowd and give us a half-assed explanation as to how. 
Truth bullets: 
• Laziness of author 
SORE WA CHIGAU YO 
Such a phenomenon doesn't happen just once, but twice. However, this time around it isn't due to laziness. This character whom I shall name X basically serves as a sacrificial lamb to keep the flame of hope alight. His/her death although tragic, was good because it built emotional conflict and in the end became the main character's resolve to overcome despair... Now, if the author continued the story with the games in mind, that would be the end of the character. Instead, in the last - minutes this character leaps out of the grave, we get yet another pathetic excuse for survival and the story ends happily ever after. The only reason why the author would do this is... 
HANGMAN'S GAMBIT 
FA_     SER_ _ C _ 
WAKATA!! 
Yep the bane of anime, that is fanservice. It is evident that the author resurrected these characters to appease the fans, but ironically, it's having the opposite effect: Those that have played Danganronpa - will now realize that all the consequential actions and decisions made during the class trials and to an extent the entire story-line have been essentially rendered null; the mature and dark themes generated are brushed away and forgotten because characters that should have died, did not. Furthermore, it is blindingly obvious to those who watch the Hope Arc that X's revival serves no other purpose besides being a cheap act of fanservice/plot device used to avoid of the true/logical not-so happy ending this series was hinting at.  
So in summary, the revival of dead characters ruins the strong themes developed in the games and instead produces a sugarcoated ending which doesn't give the Danganronpa series justice.

Amnesia is one of the most commonly used tropes in all of media throughout any medium of entertainment. And the mass use of amnesia has caused it to become very bland for many veteran media consumers. However when this trope is used properly it can work wonders for an anime. The dusk maiden of amnesia is an example of an anime that does well for what it is but has some significant problems at the same time. 
The dusk maiden of amnesia is a ---- anime series that's based off a manga of the same thing. It follows a group of students and a ghost that mysteriously died -- years ago and how they investigate paranormal activities and try to find out how the ghost died while a interesting romance develops. Despite being a very serious sypnosis there is actually a significant amount of comedy in this series and that is both good and bad at the same time. 
Dusk maiden of amnesia has a fairly well executed story. A lot of the time it follows the escapades of the paranormal investigation club. What I thought was unique is that the ghost is the president of the actual club. One major problem I had with the story though was that it can sometimes be confusing and it avoid the goal. Like this makes the plot progression unfortunately kind of poor.  
Another big issue I had is the poorly timed comedy. When the show is trying to build an ominous atmosphere within a scene all of that built up immersion is broken when random fan service or comedy is added. Though the transition becomes better in the second half. The second half of the series is undeniably better due to it being overall more engaging and it actually cuts to the point. 
One last gripe is the ending. The ending was ok but I felt that there was one scene that would have made the ending way more memorable. But than I felt they took the wussy way out and just gave us this ending that lessened the impact. But it could have been a lot worse. One positive thing is that the school setting doesn't just feel like a cheap back drop. There is some meaningful world building and lore that makes the setting more fascinating than other school set anime.  There are also some well intergrated themes in the anime.  
The characters in this show are the most impressive part of the anime. For the most part they all have solid development and they enhance the story very well. The main protagonist, Niiya, has an interesting dilemma within the story and has an excellent relationship with Yuuko and the other characters in the story. Yuuko was a fascinating heroine and she has one of the greatest examples of eternal conflict I've seen in a long time. Kirie started out as kind of bring but she develops nicely over the course of the series. Okonogi unfortunately is not as interesting as the others big still has a good relationship with niiya. An interesting note is that Yuuko reminds me of senjougohara from Bakemonogatari. 
That actual music of this anime is pretty decent. There are a few standout tracks but where it really gets good is the opening and ending scenes. These songs work well with the themes of the entire anime. The voice acting was also good and I had no complaints with how the seiyuu portrayed their respective characters. The animation was very pretty and had a sense of gloss and polish. However the background characters were all black silhouettes and this came across as kind of lazy. 
In conclusion The dusk maiden of amnesia is an intruiging mystery anime with some great characters and an addicting quality. However there were some incongruencies I had with the narrative and background art. But for those who like mystery and ghosts this one is worth a watch.

This is only for Part -. I'll come back and write another for Part - after I watch it, but I REALLY need to vent. 
First off, the art, animation, sound, and all that are all on-par for the day. There's nothing to complain about there. 
Every problem I have with this OVA comes from watching it as an avid rally fan. 
The story takes place in ----, yet none of the cars featured are even close to being that new. 
Before competing in the Safari Rally, Gen is forced to do a preliminary drive along a mountain road in France. The car he's given is a Peugeot --- T-- E-, a car that was banned from competition after the ---- season. While he's driving the ---, he comes up against a homologation model Lancia ---, which eventually goes over a cliff and explodes. That explosion is the ONLY accurate thing that happens in the entire episode (Lancias were always prone to catching fire). 
Next up comes the Safari Rally itself. We have the team he's driving for, Seiou Corp., fielding a pair of Ford Sierra Cosworths, cars that were phased out of competition in the late ----s by the onset of Group A regulations. What's better is Toyota Team Europe (a real team) is seen fielding MkIII Supras, which were never even used in rallying. They should've been running ST--- Celicas, but those didn't exist at the time the OVA was produced. The sensible thing to do would've been to draw what was being used at the time: the ST--- Celica. 
Beyond these obvious flaws, the pacenote systems for each driver are borderline-incomprehensible as there's almost no consistency and the way the rally is presented leads me to believe the people who wrote this had never even seen a rally before. It's as if somebody who watched the Safari Rally on TV explained it to the producer and then he waited a month to explain it to everybody else. 
I was all sorts of excited to see that a rally anime had been made and now I'm incredibly disappointed at the result. I can't say I have high hopes for Part -. 
Update: Part - was just as bad. This OVA is total shit.

legend of the galactic heroes is one of the landmark anime series in ----s/--s, due to the amazingly rich story, wonderful characters, great artistic design, & its classical score which still stand the test of time until this day. 
yes, there are some pitfalls which including an outdated animation & it's slow & sometimes boring narrative, this pitfall is consider nothing for how this show become as impactful as it is right now; even in ----, you rarely see a show as powerful & rich as the legend of galactic heroes. 
and in addition for that the show was released as an OVA, yes it gives them a bigger budget & more freedom than traditional TV series, but it depended on the buy rates of each new series to be profits enough for the producers to continue production of the series, make it more challenging, & still they manage to conclude the story in --- / -- minute episode, & expanded to movies, a prequel series, and a reboot which go to release in spring ----.

Zankyou no Terror is an anime I really enjoyed. It kept me coming back for more episode after episode. 
I really enjoyed the well thought out plot, which puts this anime above the few I've watched before. The characters are really cool as you somewhat get an attached feeling towards them as you progress through the anime. 
I feel that the anime could have had another episode which would've explained the orphanage and the other subjects. 
All in all, I really enjoyed this anime.

You have to watch the whole animation to fully appreciate the complexity of the plot, but when you do you'll gasp, you'll cry, and you'll fall in love with it. 
All I have to say about the movie is to hold your judgement until the very end. Once you do the puzzle pieces will all properly fall into their place and the movie will take its full role in how it is suppose to be played out. 
So sit back and enjoy the amazing animation, the soft soundtrack and the beautiful storyline.  With an amazing character development as you undergo a transformation with the lead character, Anna, a girl who slowly learns to appreciate herself and the image she projects, along with the people surrounding her.  
Anna starts off as a introvert girl, who hates herself and hold very low self esteem and a low opinion of her image. Details of how she became this way are later revealed.  
Anna suffers from Asthma, a weakness of the lungs. Thinking it will help improve her health, her ""Aunty"" and doctor think it best to send her to her relatives who live in the country for fresh clean air (just for the summer).  
Once there Anna starts to experience out of body and weird dreams with a girl named Marnie. Anna confused if these encounters are real or a dream does not know what to think about her meetings with Marnie at first. However slowly the viewer watches as Anna opens up with the help of Marnie and slowly allows others into her life. She experiences friendship for the first time, and grows through the development of the summer in her encounters with Marnie. 
This is definitely a coming of age story, one where Anna is able to accept herself and open up to others, discover her past, and learn who she is.

I'm sorry, but this anime is simply atrocious. 
I honestly don't understand the appeal of Fate/Zero at all. It's been praised by so many and it has a really high rating, however, I just can't stomach it. Mind you, there are some minor spoilers of first four episodes just to be able to shed light on why I rated the show so low without being automatically reported. Not that it won't happen regardless. 
First episode has to be the most boring, pointless episode I ever watched. Absolutely no effort was made to spark the interest of the viewer or to summarize the story properly. It threw at you an enormous amount of information about many miscellaneous things in an incredibly monotonous voice and without any proper order. Throughout the entire episode there was nothing that kept me engaged whatsoever. As if I'm supposed to be intrigued and eagerly listen to ominous, rambling, mumbling old men in robes telling us something of great importance is coming. 
Second episode had some seriously annoying and edgy characters introduced. Waver Velvet - incredibly annoying character who all he does is whine in a super annoying voice. Waver Velvet's familiar or whatever it's called, the summoned guy, the 'i'm the strongest'. *googles* Rider, right. Awful character. And he has over ---- favorites? 
Then we got the edgy scene where they brutally kill a kid with apparently some straight out of hentai tentacles to appear to be dark and serious. Then I realized, this show must have been made for fourteen year olds, and reading through the comments nothing was more obvious than that. ""This got so dark!"" or ""Giglamesh is so cool!"" were some of the comments I encountered. 
Ah, yes, you dear naive teen, just wait five years when you realize how bad one-dimensional characters Ryuunosuke Uryuu (literally read his description) and Caster (I'm evil cuz I'm evil! Fear me!) are. 
At this point I was already exhausted from nauseating boredom and cringing from awfully designed characters, but I decided not to give up yet, because I believed there had to be something interesting about the show. The fight scenes must be beyond interesting, should be absolutely ecstatic, I'm sure, because that's the reason so many people praise the series. I was deeply disappointed. 
To be honest, I didn't even remember the third episode even though I just watched it so I went to skip through it again just to remind myself what was happening in it. Ah, yes, we were following the life of aforementioned Waver and Rider, more old men in robes mumbling and towards end apparently some affair got revealed, at which point I couldn't care less about. I watched it three times and haven't remembered a thing, that's how much of an intriguing episode it was. 
Final episode I watched before deciding to throw this back into abyss, was FINALLY some actual action. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and dear slaughtered children. Something was actually happening in this episode, besides idle chat or boring monotonous speeches. Unfortunately, sixty seconds in I realized I'm not going to have fun watching it nor I am planning on continuing the anime past this point. The first fight was turned into a series of inner and outer monologues and made my immersion completely impossible and I couldn't keep bearing it. 
I tried to like this anime, I tried watching it three times, but I cease here. This anime is simply not for me. If I were to summarize it in one word, I'd have to use the word 'childish'.

Love is an act of will, an emotion that can usher individuals to take monumental, illogical actions; be it sacrificing yourself for the person you long for, or the endless chase after your beloved one. In the case of Sennen Joyuu, or Millenium Actress, it made shape the life of a young girl in her quest to find the love of her life. It is a fantastic journey with a fascinating approach in the narrative of the story. 
Genya Tachibana reaches out to the enigmatic idol of his youth, Chiyoko Fujiwara, leading actress for nearly three decades, to make a documentary of her. This may seem as something simple at first glance, yet the approach it took on the narrative was truly captivating: both Genya and his companion find themselves spiraling through the life of Chiyoko as she reminisces about her past, blending in with her memories as well as the reality.  
The way this was portrayed was very fitting for the story, jumping from one scene to another from the actress's different movies she acted in. These transitions were very smooth, with each scene portraying a distinct reality. The interactions with characters twists the reality, where Genya plays an active role in the movies with the actress. These situations often managed to crack a smile of my face, as viewers could really understand their devotion and how the characters felt, in addition to being quite amusing as well. 
The reason on why Chiyoko became an actress in the first place seemed rather weak and not plausible, having only spend a few hours as a child with a man she didn't know anything of - which will probably be what most viewers think at first. While this is certainly a debatable topic, first love can induce people to do reckless things. What however is of importance here, are the events in her life that happen afterwards, in which the anime explores the loss of innocence and youth. In addition, these events are surprisingly realistic, and relatable to the viewer. 
The cast of characters in Millenium Actress played an important role to the overall narrative of the story. First of all, the devotion of Chiyoko to the mysterious man seems rather far-fetched, yet as the story progresses, audiences observe how she ages and struggles with finding that man. It is remarkable how she ultimately confesses in enjoying the chase after said individual, rather than meeting him. As a character as a whole she was rather uninteresting, which was nevertheless compensated with her ""journey"". 
The man itself remains a mystery throughout the whole duration of the movie, which from a point of narrative and story is a positive thing. This nevertheless makes it hard for the viewer to understand Chiyoko's devotion to him, as no information is given at all, which can be a drawback for some audiences. 
What however struck me as the most interesting character was Genya; he is introduced at first as a simple filmmaker, yet as the story unravels, his past and motives becomes clear, which were introduced subtly, besides of working as an anchor for the viewers to follow the story and be able to distinguish between reality and mere memories. His dedication on why he revers Chiyoko remains however a mystery. 
The animation of Millenium Actress was well done, fluid in motions and transitions in scenes: after all, the viewers were shown differnt scenes from the movies the actress played in, which blended well with the narrative of the story. Backgrounds and characters were compelling to look at, audiences recognizing the typical designs of Satoshi Kon's characters. The soundtrack used was overall not that impressive, though certain themes were wonderful to hear. 
Overall Millenium Actress was a very enjoyable anime with a fascinating approach on the narrative, which blended reality and memories. The motives of the characters may seem rather lackluster in comparison, yet the fleshing out of those was certainly well done. I would personally recommend this movie to anyone, as it shows the viewer that the chase after something can be an interesting journey full of twists and turns - or rather, life itself. 
Thank you for reading.

To be clear, I only watched - episodes of the first season, so keep that in mind as to whether you find my review valuable or not. 
The premise of GATE is amazing, and it starts off solid in the first episode. And then it quickly devolves into a showcase of the two worst anime tropes: Japanese hyper-nationalist jingoism, and loli-girl harem. 
Had these show handled its invaders from another world theme more seriously, it would have been a damn fine show. Instead, no one in this universe behaves like a real person, or is realistic in any sense of the word. The entire purpose of the series is to show off how great Japan is and how idiotic the rest of the world is. 
Oh, and it lets young dudes watching it imagine that they are the main character, surrounded by cute underage-looking girls that fawn over him constantly. 
It's just sick, and very emblematic of where anime is right now, which is a bad place.

What was the point of this Epilogue?  Lets toss around a few scenes of characters standing in the rain on a roadside and listen to one of them talk for a half hour about deep deep things (tm)  like PHILOSOPHY and EXISTENCE and WHO ONE IS. 
I really really wonder why this episode was rated so high.  Maybe people were afraid that if they didn't rate such DEEP THOUGHTS high, others would find them dull. 
DEEP THOUGHT equals not enjoyable anime. 
DEEP THOUGHTS + PLOT can equal enjoyable anime. 
Plot, plot, where are you?

“Assassination is education. The sensei of the Assassination Classroom becomes stronger as he teaches.” – Koro-sensei  
In Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu), education is assassination, and assassination is education, to learn is to assassinate, and to assassinate is to learn. 
Class --E is not an ordinary clichéd school classroom, instead of pencils and calculators, we get knives and guns. Yes, Assassination Classroom is not your ordinary school comedy anime. It diverges and expands through the norms, and it transforms into something of utmost originality and uniqueness. 
(Disclaimer: this is going to be quite a long review, so hopefully you can bare with it!?) 
The setting of the show revolves around Class --E, a group of students of a prestigious school named Kunugigaoka Junior High School, and is perceived as inferior, being the lowest class of the institution. However, at the same time, Class E is also the location of the government’s confidential assassination scheme on Koro-sensei, the monstrous looking octopus-like being who has threatened to destroy Earth after teaching Class --E for a year. Being able to move at a speed of Mach --, Koro-sensei is almost able to do anything at will, travel anywhere and even teach his students effectively individually with his speed. His advanced capabilities and powers make assassination a difficult challenge for the students, and ultimately show the indomitability of the human spirit, the resilience of the class, and their increasingly strengthening determination of the students to strive for success after experiencing defeat and failure.  
Assassination Classroom has one of the most unique and original stories out there amongst the anime and manga industry, and is able to utilise its main theme of assassination and education to its utmost benefit, to achieve development and characterisation within its particularly large cast, and to manifest as well, many other notable themes such as the value of friendship, class and discrimination, failure and defeat, and human perseverance.  
Most of the episodes in Assassination Classroom contain many underlying didactic and moral powerful life lessons, and these are not only in the form of motivation, but also inspiration. With Koro-sensei helping the students out in both their actual education, and in their assassination attempts, the students are able to learn many values and life-changing lessons from their “teacher” and “target” whilst conducting the assassination attempts as well, and as this exchange benefits both parties, the relationship between both the teacher/target and the students/assassins are able to strengthen and develop. Many of the students have their own problems, be it their personality, or their background and upbringing, through assassination and education, Koro-sensei is able to aid these students individually as well, to seek out their troubles, and to bring good into them and show them the beauty of their lives and the bonds they encompass.  
Without a doubt, with assassination as the central theme of the show, it is this that allows immense room for the characters to learn and understand more about each other, about Koro-sensei, and ultimately, permits characters to grow both individually and together collectively. Not only do the students learn from Koro-sensei, but at the same time, Koro-sensei is also able to learn from the students, forging trust and bonds between the two in Class --E.  
The show however takes a very risky step regarding its diverse and large cast with more than -- students, and - teachers. With limited screen time, it is inevitable that not only some characters are unrecognizable, but also some of the characters will lack the necessary screen time to properly convey their backstories and personalities and may thus be deemed as “less important” or trivial. Despite this noticeable flaw with the enormous cast, it is not only each individual that compose the cast, but instead it is all of the characters collectively that the characters are able to grow as a class. Unless specific students are the central focus of an episode and in the assassination attempt, they are left forgettable and are overshadowed by the more noticeable and outstanding characters such as Nagisa and Karma.  
Shiota Nagisa is the central protagonist amongst Class-E and is often a calm and friendly person. Perhaps, it is also necessary to point out that Nagisa is the best trap. He occasionally takes on the role of an observer and narrator and is cautious in every situation. He is also very meticulous and diligent to exploring every detail of Koro-sensei’s himself in order to aid future assassination attempts. Although calm on the outside, some scenes showcase Nagisa’s inner-assassin potential and it is his calmness that makes him unique as an assassin as he is shown having the innate ability to hide his bloodlust. 
Akabane Karma is another prominent student within Class-E and is not only one of the most intelligent, cunning and witty in the class, but also one of the smartest in the entire school. Although he has a rather sadistic personality and likes to torture his opponents, Karma has a positive mindset, and also has good morals behind his intentions. He is known for being a delinquent and troublesome violator in the school, and has lost respect for adults after being betrayed by his most trusted homeroom teacher prior arriving Class -E. However, it is because of his inner-caring personality and moral mindset that he was placed in Class E as he rescued a senior from being bullied by students of the main building. Even though he may seem to be extremely smart and a genius in assassination, he has a tendency to be overconfident, arrogant and lazy at times, hindering his ability to develop further. However, Koro-sensei realises this and after Karma received a “defeat” in their confrontation with Class A, and fell in the academic rankings, Koro-sensei made it clear to Karma that he needs to abandon his overconfident self, and accept improvement because defeat ultimately incites growth, unlocking Karma’s potential as both a student and an assassin.  
It's these simple didactic and inspiring lessons that allows us watchers to also feel sympathy for the characters and at the same time, allows us to comprehend the true meaning of defeat, perseverance and the relationships the characters share together. Although reality may be harsh and dejected, one must always work his way through and persevere in order to achieve improvement– that is the glory and advantage of mankind. 
Although only glimpses of Koro-sensei’s past have been shown in the anime, it is this enigma of his character that allows suspense to fill the watchers’ minds, and keep watching further to truly understand Koro-sensei’s underlying motives behind “destroying” the world after a year of teaching. Koro-sensei is extremely humble, talented, and funnily enough, quite perverted. He cares for his students, not only about their education, but also their skills in the field of assassination as well as their own personal individual lives. It’s truly teachers like these that these students are able to grow so fast and so much both academically and as an assassin, and have a widened outlook on their lives. Although Class E may be ostracized from the main school and the higher-up classes, there is no discrimination in Class E itself after all, the class itself is almost like a family, with close bonds interconnected through each other being peers of another in a group of assassins. Even as the students love Koro-sensei and understand that he genuinely cares for them, they know that they have to still carry out their assassination because that is the initial reason of Koro-sensei joining the class, and also, the planet is being threatened to being destroyed. 
Karasuma, is another one of Class E’s teachers, a highly skilled agent sent by the Ministry of Defense. He is strict but also aids into developing the assassination skills of the students, and eventually become bonded with the class as well despite his stoic and dense personality, and suppressing his emotions because of his profession. It is also undeniable that there is a small degree of fanservice appeal brought by bitch-sensei, Irina, but again this revolves around the whole theme of assassination and is also manifestation of her assassination skills. Nevertheless, she also grows along with the rest of the students as well as Koro-sensei and Karasuma-sensei. 
The comedy is extremely well done. Ranging from Koro-sensei’s ridiculousness and his admiration for erotic magazines, to Karma’s sadistic torturing methods of sticking chilli and spicy paste into someone’s nostrils, the majority of the humour derives from the main central plot of assassination, and just goes to show how immense of a theme this is and how much it can develop the show.   
Unlike the bland special of Assassination Classroom that was animated by Brain’s Base in ----, Lerche takes Assassination Classroom to a whole new level through its distinct art style. The art style makes use of conspicuous shadows, bold borders and outlines to highlight and define each individual character. The backgrounds also look nice and are vibrant when it needs to be, and dark when it needs to be as well. The details of objects look precise through the neat and clear art. Ultimately, the anime is able to bring out the manga’s great art to life, if not, even better, taking it to a new level. The animation involved in showcasing Koro-sensei’s super speed and the subsequent surrounding environment looks phenomenal and very fluid, bringing Koro-sensei to life.  
Sound wise, both openings ‘Seishun Satsubatsu-ron’ and ‘Jiriki Hongan Revolution’ fit the show perfectly. Being upbeat and lively, the music itself pumps you up for the episode before it starts and brightens up the atmosphere. Visually, they involve the introduction of the characters of Class E and feature the characters dancing in a very comical manner which I definitely love and find hilarious. The soundtrack is also used appropriately most of the time, using suspenseful music at suspenseful moments, sentimental tracks at the more sympathetic scenes, as well as a short electronic/techno sounding track during thrilling moments such as when Ritsu analyses the floor plan during the hotel infiltration.  
The ending song itself ‘Hello, shooting-star’ by moumoon is a masterpiece and depicts a more emotional approach to the show with its lighthearted and sentimental tone. The visuals are stunning utilising a chalkboard and chalks to visualise the ending song with its characters. For me, every time this ending plays I never skip it, and instead, I envision what it would be like if Koro-sensei were to actually be killed, and how emotional it would truly be.  
With a second season confirmed in production, we can expect to see more intriguing arcs, more suspenseful moments, as well as increasingly more characterisation and story development as the show unfolds itself. 
Undoubtedly, Assassination Classroom diverges from the ordinary anime, and transforms norms into a show that is original, unique and creative. Through the central plot, the show is able to merge both assassination and education to develop the cast as a whole, manifest individual growth and exhibit the interlinking bonds of the class. Not only this, but this is a show that truly allows you to learn from its many underlying didactic messages as well, both subtle and explicit. And I certainly recommend everyone to try out Assassination Classroom at some point because this is a show that has shown me both inspiration and motivation.

My friend and I started watching this show because we're both huge Legend of Galactic Heroes fans, and the novelist that created that show also created this one. Legend of Galactic Heroes is probably one of the best anime shows of all time; it's a show of amazing ambition and scope that manages to blend in personal struggles, memorable characters, and a galaxy-spanning war without ever becoming unengaging to the audience. 
Unfortunately, Heroic Legend of Arslan doesn't live up to that pedigree. Well, whatever, Yoshiyuki Tomino had Garzey's Wing, I guess Yoshiki Tanaka has Arslan. 
The biggest problems I had with the series were the story, characters, and animation. I'm probably going to reference LoGH a lot to prove my points. 
STORY: The story hooked me right away with the first episode. It seemed like it had the makings of a classic story - a kingdom falls, a prince vows to get the kingdom back, he gets some allies, some plot twists happen, he raises an army, and gets back the kingdom in the end. 
The problem is that the characters themselves seemed to lack emotion and seemed dispassionate about actually getting Pars back. In addition, I never really got a good handle on how the war between the prince's group and the usurpers was actually going. In Legend of Galactic Heroes, they usually took a few seconds during each battle to illustrate in some way which side was winning and their spatial locations. In Arslan, I had problems following who was where and why. 
Also, Arslan continues something that I hate, hate, hate about anime series: no ending. Basically, he starts almost at square one again, invalidating all the effort he took in the previous five episodes! 
CHARACTERS: The second biggest problem with Arslan are the characters. I mentioned it above, but Arslan seems mostly indifferent to the prospect of actually getting back Pars. Sure, he mentions it, but it doesn't feel like he has any sort of spark or drive. With Lohengramm in LoGH, you got the sense that he was full of (and would eventually be consumed by) his ambition.  
The other characters in his group were kind of a flatline for me too: none of them except for that black armor knight seemed interested in Pars either. They seemed to be mostly along for the ride and didn't seem like they were actually friends or life-and-death companions.  
The only character that seemed to have any passion was the Silver Mask villain. It was funny actually, I thought his beef with Pars was pretty legit, and I was kind of rooting for *him* to succeed. Who cares if he used black magic, at least he had some sort of drive! 
ANIMATION: Arslan's animation is inconsistent from episode-to-episode. Character designs seem to change, the quality of the animation seems to change, and it's very noticeable. Not having a consistent animation style is off-putting, and it takes you out of the story. 
OVERALL: I'm giving this a -. I really wanted to like this show, but all the elements that worked in Legend of Galactic Heroes simply don't work here. Whether it was being confused by character motivation or not being terribly interested in the characters, Arslan had problems that made it a below average viewing experience.

If Troma Films, the film creators known for sex exploitation, were to create an anime, this would be the anime.  
The story is dreadfully boring, garbage even, but it picks up very late. In fact, more than half way through is when it gets good. Before then, you ask yourself why you're even bothering to watch the anime.  
It tries to force ""messed up stuff"" as an excuse for how ""dark"" or ""deep"" the series is, but it's incredibly forced. It references messed up stuff in a way that feels a bit forced, it feels like a collection of dark subjects that were added more to make the story feel edgy and dark, not because they actually contributed a whole lot to the story.  
There is a lot of nudity in the anime, a lot stuff that feels out of place. From random nudity and breast grabbing to random discussions about stuff that adds nothing but blood to my cock and definitely nothing to the story. Perversion as a joke is fine, but when it's consistent and feels forced, it starts to be too much and demeans its own quality and the viewers trying to watch it.  
When you do get pass its so many flaws, from the perversion to the mediocre characters with the mediocre plot, you will eventually get to a point where the story shifts full gears to being absolutely interesting. The story picks up, a lot more is on the table, characters that had no value suddenly have character development and suddenly you care about them and the things happening are engaging. The anime is actually good in the last few episodes.  
It's a shame that nearly --% of the anime is mediocre, it had a good concept going. With the poor character development, a somewhat boring story, and the constant perversion that takes what feels like the prioritized theme, I feel majority of people that gave this a super low rating did not finish it because it's so hard to want to invest your time watching it. 
For anyone else like myself that finishes watching it, it still wont by any mean get praises. At the end of the day, it's story is kinda cliche as far as the technical parts go. The cliches are dreadfully consistent and nothing strongly compensates for them.  
I would never recommend this anime to anyone that hasn't watched any of the other more higher quality animes. For anyone that feels like they have seen it all, maybe give this a try just to get it over with. You're investing several hours for a couple of enjoyable thirty minutes.

This review both covers First Stage & Second Stage. I’ll try not to spoil as much as possible. 
Well, for me, this is a rarity for an anime series where the subject involves street racing although it is not strange in Japan since the concept of that is known in - countries and the fact that street racing has been involved in other parts of media including videogames like Midnight Club, some elements of street racing have been shoved in Grand Theft Auto & later iterations of Need For Speed franchise and also in the cinema, which I will bring up later in the review. 
Anyway, it is based off the manga series created by Shuichi Shigeno and it’s been serialized in Kodanasha’s Young Magazine. The story focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the action is concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in cities nor urban areas, and the drift racing style (a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, causing loss of traction in the rear wheels, while maintaining control from entry to exit of a corner is emphasized in particular. 
In the first stage of the series, it focuses on high school student Takumi Fujiwara, who works at a gas station attendant by day but at night he’s a delivery boy (since -th grade) for his father’s tofu shop. His father is Bunta Fujiwara, a street racer with a great reputation in his younger days and was known as “The Ghost of Akina”.  What little did Takumi knew, he does have an inherent sense for drifting on local mountain roads and is a natural expert yet he never seem interested doing that until a local race team called the Akina Speed Stars, who is in need of a replacement driver after the last one had an accident, is going up against reigning skilled street racers the RedSuns. 
In the second stage of the series, a team from the Tochigi Prefecture called Team Emperor and their leader Kyoichi Sudo challenges every racing team in the Gunma area and does come out victorious and once they heard of The Akina Eight-Six and they see what it can do, the tension around there raises not only for the Akina SpeedStars but for all of the racers in the Gunma area. 
As for characters, while Takumi seems like it doesn’t give a damn about street racing, later in the series, he starts to understand the pride of a street racer and does begins accepting challenges, despite the car he was being a Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE--, which is considered inferior towards the other racer’s cars and when Takumi outshines them in the races, even though, what he’s got wasn’t up to current standards, it makes me ask this question………does he have the touch? 
Okay, that was a bit stupid. 
As for the his team, his friend Itsuki is the comic relief of the show and yes, he is loud and obnoxious and won’t staple his mouth shut for a while but he does play the role of being confident in Takumi and his racing skills. Iketani is the leader of the Akina SpeedStars and while he is an average driver, he fits the leadership at a few times and Kenji, best friend of Iketani and possibly one of the level-headed members of the group (Iketani is a close second). 
I would mention Natsuki Mogi, the love interest of Takumi, and they do have this subplot of him and her hanging out and eventually ending up together but her part doesn’t get bigger until the -nd stage, where we (but mostly Takumi) also learned that she’s engaged in enjo kosai to make some extra cash on the side but Takumi isn’t the only one with love in the brain. Iketani does have a crush on this girl named Mako Sato, who is part of the racing duo Impact Blue with her as the driver and her partner Sayuki as the navigator, but that relationship also have dire consequences during that course and Itsuki did have…….or had a relationship with this girl but that part is very unimportant to the plot of the series. 
Now, originally I thought this series was going to be a rip-off of The Fast and The Furious movies but that’s due to the fact that when TokyoPop originally got the license of the anime and the manga, they would Americanize the characters’ names and some did reflect the changes Sega pushed when they implanted into the Western releases of the video games following (Iggy, Tak, Natalie, Maya, Simone, Cole), throw in some street slang which to attract the younger audiences and where the original had some Eurobeat music mixed in, they replaced with some (IMO) very generic rock and hip hop music done by the CEO of TokyoPop, Stu Levy or better yet, his stage name DJ Milky (Really?  DJ Milky? I thought Plies was a worst name for a rapper and/or producer). That result just seem like they want this to be like The Fast and The Furious when it’s not. Unlike those movies, the plot of the series actually involves racing and so far it sticks to it and I’m a guy that actually likes Fast Five……and possibly a bit of Tokyo Drift but I see why want to cash in with those movies and it’s a horrible reason nevertheless a reason. 
Also, the music in the original Japanese and Funimation dub was alright but it never drawn that much attention from me, although the first opening and ending songs was good, the later ones I could care less about. The music just seem like videogame music for Dance Dance Revolution rather than anything to do with racing but hey, I think it fits more into the series than the other music. The TokyoPop songs were honestly too corny and too self-reliant on grunge rock and hip hop to sell to Western audiences and possibly that and the awful excuse of a rap song from the -Kids dub of One Piece are mostly the reason why sometimes anime and hip hop don’t mix that well together (except for Samurai Champloo and Afro Samurai, those actually go well together). 
The animation for both series is proved to be dated, considering the anime was made in the late --s, some character designs were a bit crude but it is realistic and differs from the traditional anime look. The CG racing cars does clash with the -D animation and it is not a good sight but the animation does improve during the second stage with the character designs being less crude-looking but still retains its realistic look. 
FINAL VERDICT: The anime is actually good and I didn’t have any high or great expectations of this but this one actually surprised me. It actually focuses on its prime objective and doesn’t glamourize the life of being a street racer (i.e. drugs, parties, women at the palm of your hands) and while it does show illegal street racing (albeit only on mountain passes), the show does advise you to only do this at safe locations like a track where you won’t run over somebody and takes what lessons about drifting seriously, as in, this is nothing to joke about. I would recommend if you are somebody that expected more from the you-know-what movies, this is your treat. The -nd stage of the series actually covers more of the plot without putting much filler episodes like in the previous one. 
Also, for the ones who are prefer dubs like me, stick to the FUNimation dub. The TokyoPop dub may have voice actors you like but honestly, this dub does no justice to them.

Howl's Moving Castle was originally a novel by Diana Wynn Jones. A light-hearted fantasy tale, the book executes just about every aspect of its story perfectly - the action, the mystery, the romance, the comedy - without ever losing its tone or feeling inconsistent. Though there are many fantasy authors whose overall body of work I would prefer (Terry Brooks and Brian Jacques come to mind), Howl's Moving Castle is my favorite book of all-time. And, unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the movie rendition. 
To give credit where credit is due, Miyazaki brings to life the world of Howl's Moving Castle better than I could have expected. Everything is gorgeously animated, and the soundtrack is terrific. These are things we've come to expect from Studio Ghibli, and they deliver time and time again. Beyond this, however, I take issue with almost everything else in the film. 
The story is very simple on the surface: Sophie, a hat-maker's daughter, feels resigned to a boring and uninteresting life as the middle child, destined to inherit the store while her sisters live much more exciting lives. However, the fearsome wizard Howl's castle appears near her town, and after a chance encounter with the wizard (Who does not seem to be the maiden-heart-devouring monster she heard about) Sophie comes face-to-face with the Witch of the Waste, who places her under a curse that causes her to become an old woman. She sets out then to find Howl and see if he can undo her curse. Living in Howl's Castle, she strikes a deal with his fire demon Calcifer: If she can break Calcifer's contract with Howl, Calcifer will break her curse. Of course, there is a great deal more to this story as the film progresses, but you'll have to watch to find out! 
The characters feel woefully underdeveloped compared to their literary counterparts. While this is often true of films, due to the time restraints forced upon the story, in this movie it felt particularly troublesome. Barring comparisons to the novel, everyone still feels shallow and their motivations were often unclear. Sophie is the only character who really seems to develop. Howl in particular is incredibly blase, which is shocking considering how full of life his literary version was. There were many side characters whose own stories felt completely nonsensical or pointless in the movie, as key things were cut or re-purposed for time constraints. Characters' entire motivations are changed, particularly the Witch of the Waste and Howl's old teacher (who becomes an entirely different person in the film). Changes aren't necessarily bad, but in making these adjustments the film seems to lose focus and feels significantly more scattered. Ironically, this is despite cutting many narrative threads. 
The story also suffers greatly. The book excels at creating subplots throughout the world-building, all of which play into the story, come to a resolution and create incredibly satisfying moments in their own right. This is not the case in the film. Really, only the main story has any kind of dynamic, and though the books' subplots (such as the Scarecrow) are present in some fashion, they really have no explanation and the conclusions come completely out of left field. Consequently, the movie really lacks in narrative punch. Miyazaki also makes radical changes to the story. In this film, a significant focus is placed on Howl's reluctance to join the war effort, something that was not particularly present in the book. Again, changes aren't necessarily a bad thing, but the changes made here all seem to work to the film's detriment. The new elements of the story are not explained particularly well, and pacing of the film also suffers drastically. Whereas the book had a steady build all the up to a thrilling climax that tied so many disparate narrative threads together, the movie jumps all over the place in terms of tension. The climax also seems to almost come out of nowhere. Watching the film for the first time, I was never sure exactly where we were in the story until it just suddenly... ended. Things just jumped around too much, and the stakes are never properly established. 
I understand there are many people who very much enjoyed this film. Though I have many harsh criticisms of it, Howl's Moving Castle is not a bad film by any means. It is crafted well, with gorgeous aesthetics, but I have a hard time overlooking the significant reduction in quality of story and characters when compared to the book. If you're thinking of watching the film, I highly recommend reading the book first. The film and novel are very different works of art, but I cannot escape the thought that Miyazaki weakened the product by changing focus so much and not creating enough support for his new ideas.

OMG this was an incredibly boring anime...it took but sheer force of will not to drop this title! But rest assured I wasn't sitting in front of the monitor the whole time. Such a waste with all the lovely bishounen, but I guess it goes to show; ""you can't put lipstick on a pig"" and having all the bishounen in the world isn't a guaranteed success. But seriously, I shouldn't have to be a classical music major or aficionado to appreciate this anime. If I could enjoy an anime about baseball [Big Windup] when I dislike sports or be completely entertained by a story about galactic garbage collectors [PlanetES] then I should be able to enjoy this anime. But I don't and not because of the subject matter but because of the story itself which I found to be very slow, non-existent in some parts, non-committal in others and totally indecisive. 
Hhmmm, the art....,I wouldn't say it was terrible, but for a --------- title, I'm pretty much underwhelmed. Barring the character designs, which were lovely, there is absolutely nothing interesting about the art. The backdrops were generic, the sceneries were boring...actually anything that went beyond the characters was boring and inconsequential. Oh and be prepared for lots and LOTS of still shots like when the characters are playing their instruments, a lot of the time you'll just see still shots of them holding their instrument of choice with some serene look on their face. It doesn't happen all the time, some of the animation is nice [it's nice to see the fingers moving on the strings] but the static images do appear very frequently. And I feel, the topic of classical music is already boring enough as it is, they could have at least put some proper effort into the animation. Also expect to see the same audience for ALL FOUR concerts, there is a lot of recycling of stock images. 
Not much I can say about the music either, since I'm not a fan of classical music...I might have a vague interest in Baroque and some piano works but that's as far as it goes for me. I'm sure it's all lovely but it did nothing for me. Which if anything made me like the anime even less, but before you jump down my throat and say stuff like “then why did you pick an anime about classical music if you don't like classical music???” But like I said, from my own experience, anime titles in the past have taken topics I've had zero to little interest in and made them fascinating. I hate sports, but liked Wild Striker, Prince of Tennis and totally LOVED Big Windup! I hate Westerns but loved Gun Frontier, I hate talking animals and god knows how many of those are in anime? So I expected an interesting [if at the very least informative] story about classical music, but there was none of that, so I'm still pretty much an outsider when it comes to classical music.  
I also have mixed feelings for the intro song “Brand New Breeze” part of me likes it but the other part of me think it sounds a little bit too much like a commercial for some kind of laundry detergent or feminine product....[just keeping it real, sorry] 
Story....hhhhmmmm, one word: ABYSMAL! OK so the story is about a girl who was magically chosen [for some reason or another, which is irrelevant since it's only some thinly veiled premise to get her surrounded by a bunch of hot guys] to participate in some sort of classical music playoff. But the contest is not the central theme, the actual theme is music appreciation and each character's relation to it...which, yes, may sound deep but none of this came across to the viewer. There was nothing that really drew me into being interested in classical music like I felt when I watched a baseball game with Big Windup, for example. There's no humour, there's no romance to speak of, they didn't even get into the technical aspects of classical music. In Hikaru no Go, they made moving those little game pieces on a board seem so exciting and dramatic and they also informed me about how the game of GO is played and even certain strategies and tactics. There is none of that in this series, except maybe if you want to count the fairy at the end talking about Bach and Beethoven, which I don't.  
This series seriously spent the better part of -- episodes to talk about how each of them loved music or played their music [which to be honest sounded just a little more than pretentious “Ah this sonatta is so brilliant and the strings are so vibrant and so transparent”....yeah bull***t] There’s nothing else to this anime besides this and maybe some minor romantic innuendo [FAIL]. It's only after episode -- when all the B.S. goes away, such as the magic violin and all that reverse harem kitsch that she, Kahoko, has to really deal with the fact of being a such novice violinist does the show even have any sort of merit. 
So Like I said before, the character designs were lovely. I can't really complain there! And to be honest, that's the only real selling point of this series: very nice character designs and a lot of time spent on character development. That being said, it's not like we're going to discover anything new with these characters, they all pretty much follow the typical anime character templates: The Femme/Bishie Heartthrob, The Sporty one, The Angelic/Loli one, The Loud Comic one, The Posh/Stuck-up one, The Glasses one, etc... It's all pretty much colour-by-number, isn't it? 
My Verdict: The cast is PRETTY, but the show's BORING so overall it's ""pretty boring""....get it? Hey, gotta do something to entertain myself cuz god knows this anime ain't doing it for me.

""Teamwork makes the dream work."" 
-Anonymous 
First of all, let me come out and say that I have never played volleyball in my entire life, and prior to watching haikyuu, I had just about no knowledge concerning volleyball, or haikyuu the manga. 
I first came to know it because for every episode of Chihayafuru (another sports anime that isn't a major game), comments kept telling me that Chihayafuru was a good competitor against Haikyuu, and being a Chihayafuru fan myself, I was interested. 
The overall theme of Haikyuu is volleyball, but there is little to no leading female characters in the whole anime. The main focus team consists of male, and I was a little skeptic that the infamous sport for women was played by men, and was a little worried that some feminist viewers might take this the wrong way. 
While holding this skepticism, I started watching Haikyuu. 
Story: -- 
And what a great choice it was. 
A sports anime tends to follow the general trend of genius transfer-team problems and reconciliation-infinite wins. Although this increasingly mild out throughout the years, the general structure of any sports anime, or sports tv show, for that matter, follows this trend. And, Haikyuu was, arguably, also a follower of this combination. 
But? 
One word that sums up Haikyuu would be ""climax"". Every episode, every minute, every second of this anime feels like the climax and keeps the viewers on the edges of the seats at all times. Every second, the anime builds up to the result of this move, and shows the result of that move. Every other second, the anime makes the viewers ask, ""What happened?"" ""What'll Hinata/Kageyama do now?"" ""What was that?"" ""What will happen?"" 
Besides the thrill of watching haikyuu, there is the theme that I could not like more that the anime holds almost religiously, which is the fact that VOLLEYBALL CANNOT BE PLAYED ALONE. 
On the surface, it is a ""duh"" idea. Volleyball needs at least two spikers, a libero and a setter. Volleyball has to be at least played by two people. 
But this is what makes this anime awesome. 
Although this has disappeared over the years, sports anime tend to show an overly talented main character who takes care of everything, or the op main character in layman's term. In fact, this is a trend that is not just in sports anime but in all kinds of anime in general. Now, before we see an anime, we almost have to make an assumption that the main character is going to solve the problem. 
This is NEVER shown in Haikyuu. 
Sure, we have two ""centers"" of the story, Hinata and Kageyama, and they provide a mild solution to the problem, but the show still does not make these two solve every problem they encounter. Haikyuu respects the other characters and lets other players shine as well. In fact, the show makes it so that if the two main characters try to solve everything on their own, problems arise and they ultimately fail. 
I could not like this cliche-breaker more. 
The only small problem this had was simple. 
This is not the end. 
I was...for the lack of better term, teased to my nth degree and left hanging. 
However, I say it is a small problem because I can almost forgive it. I have enjoyed the show as it was when it aired, and could not ask for a better time management. In fact, if this anime rushed and finished the whole thing before I could understand what was going on, I would have given this a -/--. So, I did not mind the lack of an ending, but i still want the sequel. 
As for the actual volleyball itself, as I said, I never liked or watched volleyball and knew close to nothing about the rules of volleyball, and yet I still liked it. The anime guided the viewers nicely through the terminologies that non-volleyball viewers would know, and made sure that everyone knew what was going on. 
For this, I give -- out of -- for story. 
Sound: - 
Freakin' SPYAIR. 
For those who don't know who these guys are, go to google and type Samurai Heart, buy mp- and play the shit out of it. 
The other songs were nice too, including the second part's ending, which was a nice head-chiller after getting hyped from the awesomeness of the actual episode. 
The first ending was beautiful as well, but not as good as the second ending. The opening for the second was not as great as the first either, so overall I give - for OP/ED. 
As for the voice actors, I could not ask for a better voice actor for Kageyama and Nishinoya, and I was quite surprised that an anime with a voice staff this big could get such a fitting voice for each character. 
Problem is Hinata. 
I personally had no problem with Hinata's voice, but I could understand when people say that his voice was annoying, as I felt that way at the start as well. He is not bad at pronunciation or anything, but he is...well, you have to hear it to understand it. I gave - for voice acting. 
Lastly, the OST was quite splendid. As this was a sports anime, it was critically important for the OST to do its job and keep the viewers' hype from chilling. And, cutting out the boring lead-in, the OST did its job. The only problem i had was the fact that there was no song I wanted to keep it for myself, and for that I give - for OST. 
(-+-+-)/-=-.-- or just - 
Character: -- 
There is not a single side character in this anime. Everyone plays  a part, or at least, everyone who got longer than -- seconds of airtime got a part. 
We have Nishinoya, the libero of Karasuno team, playing the ""cool guy"" role. We have Daichi, the captain, playing the strict but kind captain. We have Tsukishima, the blocker, playing the harsh but actually nice guy. We have Kenma, who literally just appeared in - episodes, influencing the whole Karasuno team in more than one way. 
The development for the main characters is also a job well done. Kageyama goes from the self-centered setter to a team-rounded setter, and Hinata goes from the spike-obsessed volleyball otaku to...well, actually he's still spike-obsessed volleyball otaku in the end, but we see a lot of change in Hinata as well, as he was only the physically sharp chibi at the start, but ended up being the greatest bait. 
But as our parents, grandparents and everyone who is smarter than us once said, nothing in our world is ever perfect. 
Art: - 
The animation studio in charge of this was the infamous Production IG, known for its high-quality motions and bizarre artstyle that needs people to get used to. 
Unfortunately, there still was the bizarre artstyle in haikyuu, yet the high-quality motion was gone from existence. 
....Yeah, I know. 
I would rather have the people see the actual anime and judge for themselves, but if I am to list some problems, 
-. There are waaaay too much still pictures. 
-. As IG repetitively proved to us, their artstyle needs some getting-used-to. 
-. They reuse the same animation for receiving and spiking way too much that it makes me cringe. 
-. When the characters are talking, although they must have been exhausted from running and jumping all over the place, there is not a drop of sweat on their face. 
Still, the animation had some quality points too. The animation for receiving and spiking, although it was used way too much, was superb, and the movements of all the characters, at least during the game, was very fluent. 
So, I give art - out of --. 
Enjoyment: -- 
But I still liked it a lot. 
I found myself regulating my breath from the feeling of my heart exploding over and over again, and kept my eyes glued on the monitor for the entire time I watched the show. I loved the development of all the characters and I never skipped through out of boredom. 
Overall: - 
Thank you, Haikyuu, for a great adventure. 
I could not recommend this more, but I suggest to wait until the bd version comes out, because I am expecting a better animation in the bd. Still, if you can't wait for the bd for certain reasons, I suggest you watch this the next chance you get. 
Then, until next time, happy anime-ing, and may the anime be with you.

**SPOILER FREE REVIEW** 
- seasons, -- episodes of -- minutes each aproximately (s-, s-, s-) and - episodes of -- each in s-, making a total of almos -- hours of my life watching this anime ... And this is what I get? 
I have to be honest, I really enjoyed the first - seasons, I got really hooked up to the series for some reason and I wanted to see the beautiful end that made me feel ""It was all worth"" but no. What I saw was -- episodes based on just - character, putting aside all the history of previous seasons, putting aside all of the main characters, putting aside everything just for - character ... And ending that did not close anything and mean less Than Nothing 
Those -- episodes felt just like the begining of the story but no, that's all folks. They could have done that in just - episodes and close the story like this series deserved it. I'm very dissapointed and sad. Please do not watch this last season nor the -rd one, in my opinion this series should have ended in the -nd season, when it was still good.

This adaptation is riddled with issues, ranging from fairly minor to really irksome, but my biggest problem with it is the direction. 
Seiji Kishi did P-: The Animation a hell of a lot of justice. It may not have had the biggest budget or the highest-quality art, but the slice-of-life episodes were hilarious, and there were several really memorable (and emotional) action scenes. One need only recall the remarkably well-handled summer episodes, which retold several social link arcs in a really entertaining and satisfying manner, to realize the core strengths of the show. The anime ended up capturing the tone of the game perfectly and, for what it's worth, the pacing was alright (the game itself is certainly not much better in that regard).  
I could go on - what about Yu Narukami, whose nonchalant and deadpan lines from the game carried over seamlessly into the show, and occasionally ended up being even funnier? He's a prime example of how to go about constructing the personality of an originally silent protagonist. Not to mention he even goes through a little arc of his own that wasn't present in the game. 
And here we have P- the Animation, which starts out at a lightning-fast pace. Not too different from P-. I can certainly forgive that to an extent, as it's standard introductory episodes fare. But in this case the build-up to the Kamoshida conflict (and the aftermath) feels so rushed, that what is considered by many the most poignant act in the game turns out to be the first real low point of the show. The production values are at their worst around this point as well. 
Thankfully, the show begins to pick up with Yusuke's arc. The pacing slows down a bit. Goro gets some significant screen time to himself and his encounters with the Phantom Thieves, which makes sense considering the conflict of ideals which the story has to establish before it can move forward. Makoto is no less likable either and her design looks great. The main characters' confidant arcs which have been included thus far get resolved within an episode or two, whereas the other confidants have been shown in a few scenes, occasionally aiding the Phantom Thieves (as is the case with Ohya), and I can only assume they are going to have their stories fleshed out sooner or later. Kawakami's encounter as a maid with Ren was actually funnier than the game and she's somehow even more adorable. 
Our protagonist Ren doesn't quite match up to his game self. While he retains the semblances of a lovable dork, he's missing those snide dialogue choices from the game, and actually doesn't speak that much relative to the other characters at all. I can't fault his representation here too much, as keeping the protagonist's blank-slate character was a reasonable decision, if a bit on the safe side.  
Before I go any further, what do you think are the P-/-/- games actually about? The typical response would be a cross between a dating sim and a dungeon crawler with demons. So why haven't the creators of this show sought to adapt both these aspects? 
See, the Persona v demon battles are embarrassingly short and poorly animated. This is assuming there is an animated battle taking place on-screen, as they haven't even bothered doing most of them. To the average fan of the games, this feels unfortunately alienating. P- is even lengthier than P-, yet it's possible the former will end up having fewer episodes than the latter, for which I find there's absolutely no excuse. Of course they'd rather fill the episodes with more story, but this begs the question of why the series was planned like that in the first place. Knowing P- replaced shadows with classic SMT demons, each with its own quirky personality, it wouldn't hurt to see them in action a little more. 
The game is also known and loved for how stylish it is. But the moment the anime tries to emulate some of that style, you know you're getting mixed results at best. There's no need to include the red-black transitions that tell us that a day has gone by or the characters are moving to a new place. And that all-out attack animation has yet to be neatly animated. The art in general is alright, although the show creates an atmosphere that's not nearly as evocative or moody like that of the game. 
I do hope the show ultimately gets the treatment it deserves. It's not a terribly boring watch by any means - just really disappointing to big-time fans.

So, this anime has all the genres that I personnaly love: Comedy,Romance, Adventure and Action (maybe also Historical). So, first of all, this anime was a dream that was fulfilled for me. 
Story: 
The story is refreshing. From the first episode, I thought, ""ohh,it´s gonna be one of those kinda shows..."", but I was wrong. The story takes a quick plottwist and if you watch episode - to the end, you´re guaranteed to be longing for the next episode. The story is really well done. Though there arr some reverse harem and cliches, I think they suit in the story very well. ^^ 
Art: 
The art of the anime should be one everyone would be okay with. It´s pretty detailed and also well done. 
Sound: 
Both the Openings and Endings are beautiful. While the first op has a more historical, instrumental feeling, the second one is really energetic and refreshing. I think both them suit the anime perfectly, as well as the endings. 
Character: 
I think, this point is a very strong point of this anime. The characters of this anime make the stroy rich, because every one of them has a COMPLETLY different personaltiy. As story progresses, ESPECIALLY the main character,goes through some major development or is forced to. In my opinion, there will at least be one character in the whole story that you would like, cause, really, no type of chara can be left out here. 
The ""main villain"" is also very well done as a character, but I would definetly recommend the manga if you want to learn more about him... 
I also like the different types of connections the charas have to each other. 
Enjoyment: 
I really enjoyed it.~ The genres are on point and I enjoyed that it was a shojou anime with action, though it wasn´t mahou shojou...  
Overall: 
A really good anime and as an shoujo/action fan you definetly shouldn´t miss this one out. The anime has a  pretty open ending, that´s why I think you should continue with the manga. You can easily progress with the story because it´s really clear where the anime end ends and where you have to continue reading the manga. :)

Anime Title: Anthem of the Heart 心が叫びたがってるんだ。“Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda” 
Production Studio: A-- Pictures 
Director: Tatsuyuki Nagai 
Composer: Masaru Yokoyama 
Release Date: Sep --, ---- 
Running Time: - Hour -- Minutes 
Genres: Drama, Fantasy, Music 
The show must go on! This famous phrase in show business in which it talks about no matter what happen will always begin no matter if someone is left behind.. A story about redemption of a girl who leaves her fears and emotions behind herself while in search for a way making a voice for herself. So sit back, relax, and enjoy my reading my latest review of Anthem of the Heart. 
================================================================== 
~Story -/--~ 
The story of AotH is one about how a girl grows to get out of her shell of being alone and secluded. This girl slowly grows from becoming the one person in the class who rarely ever talks, to singing front and center on stage. In the movie a high school class is tasked to come up with an idea for something to do for the school’s festival thing… and the thing that they come up with is a musical. However, lucky for them they decided to take the hard way out by deciding to write their own show. This includes the writing the following all from scratch: script, music, costumes, set design, choreography, etc. 
Wait...you say that I am forgetting something major? Oh yeah! In the film the girl I talked about above has one little secret. The said “secret” is that the girl is cursed by an egg… let me repeat this… she is cursed by an EGG. The said curse is that whenever the girl talks she randomly ends up getting stomach pain soon after. So to avoid having stomach pain the girl just decided to give up talking entirely and just text everything she is thinking instead. Honestly I think that this idea is just so outlandish, but I do feel that it makes for a very unique and well written character in the long run. 
~Characters -/--~ 
Jun Naruse is the female main character in AotH. Naruse is silent all of the time and this is due to the fact in how she is afraid of speaking due to the curse that I explained up above. Personally I believe that the egg and the curse is all in her head and is just a way to compensate for her major role in the divorce of her parents, which occurs in the first ten minutes of the movie. However the thing that makes this character memorable is how you slowly notice the character grow overtime and eventually break out of her shell *no pun intended*. Over all, I absolutely fell in love with this character. 
Takumi Sakagami is an male lead character in AotH. He is an talented musician with a heart of playing the piano. He is the songwriter for his class’s musical, meanwhile trying his hardest to make sure that Naruse is able to have her voice be heard. Takumi is always by Naruse’s side no matter what happens and is also a child of divorced parents just like how Naruse is as well. Takumi is also the kind of guy who is willing to say anything in order to calm down another character, even if he knows that he is lying… he just does not want to talk about his true feelings to others. I believe he was a good character but would enjoyed to see more of him.  
Daiki Tasaki is an male lead character in AotH. He is a sports jock that specializes in Baseball, and is infact one of the leading members of in his team. Even tho he is a sports guy, he still has a kind heart and is willing to step up and be a leader in his class when it comes to the time of setting up for the musical. He isn’t afraid to ask a girl out, and even if he is rejected he turns around and understands as to why the answer is no. Daiki was a decent character in my opinion, but I feel as if the script writer could have done more with him. 
Natsuki Nitou is an female lead character in AotH. She is the main leader of the group that wants to start up the play in the first place. In the past Nitou was at one point Takumi’s girlfriend. Over time we are shown how this relationship did not work and the two decided to part ways, but at this point in time they are friends. She is willing to step in for the absence of another character being missing right before the musical performance, and this is quite the brave thing to do last second since it was so unexpected. Other than that, I don’t know much about this character to whom of which I believe is the most underused character in the entire movie. 
~Music -/--~ 
What can I say about it other than it is slow and relaxing and was cleverly written to not only convey the emotion in the scene but also amplify it towards the audience. And as for the musical pieces, they were very basic. Just re-writing the lyrics to famous songs that I’m sure that most of you know, for example “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” which is mentioned quite a lot in this movie. But this is to be expected for the musical pieces since it is a completely original performance written by a bunch of highschoolers with not much time at all, so it is actually very realistic for this to be the case. 
Overall, I really enjoyed this soundtrack and believe it fit well with the themes of the movie. My favorite song from this soundtrack is one that goes by the name of “Harmonia”. 
~Art/Animation -/--~ 
The art and animation is beautiful for the most part but there are a few derp faces sprinkled in here and there but it isn’t obvious unless if you look for them. However the background art for this movie were beautiful and highly detailed, and I would like to applaud A-- for making such a gorgeous looking film. 
~Final Thoughts~ 
Over all I thought it was an excellent movie that had a few problems here and there but I enjoyed it. However I feel like this movie could have been a better story if it was turned into an twelve or eleven episode tv series instead. I can tell that some people will criticize this movie for being too “melodramatic”, but personally I am completely fine with it and it isn't too overbearing either unlike a little series called Plastic Memories. I was surprised how this movie revolved around a class musical, in which I can deeply relate too because I am a theater kid and is partially why I enjoyed this movie. I feel like the characters could be fleshed out better with the exception of the main character, in which I feel was handled perfectly. Man did I love the scene in which *minor spoilers* Naruse has finally cracked and just lets loose of all the anger that has resided within her for years *minor spoilers ends*. Also I believe the egg was just a figment of Naruse’s imagination and was just used as an excuse for her to not talk in fear of messing up another relationship with a friend or family member, again. 
I have to be honest with all of you, if this review seemed a bit off or sloppier than most, the reasoning behind that is due to the fact in which I had writer's block and had barely any desire to finish this review. So I decided to just stick with it and push out the review while also trying my hardest to make the best quality product I could. 
After careful consideration I have decided to give this movie an -/--, and a recommendation to watch it on your own time. Not exactly a high priority movie to watch, but it was definitely worth watching. And I must say, I was hit by the feels train quite a few times while watching this movie.  
I also wanted to apologize for my absence on the reviews a bit, I got sidetracked by schoolwork and college visits for the last few weeks. But be sure to check out my First Impressions post of what my thoughts are on all of the first episodes that I’ve seen from the Spring ---- anime season, in which the post will be released sometime later this week.

So you want to know about the anime School Days? Well this show has no equal, it's bad, but for it's own lovely way. 
So if you are like any fan of anime you have probably heard the name School Days tossed around here and there and its reputation for being bad. Well, they aren't wrong, but it's probably not how you think it is. This show is the anti feel good, the bastard child of a harem/romance. This show is about the art of being a pimp and getting hoes. 
That's a lie. 
It's actually about an individual who cannot control his emotions with the girls around him. He attempts to date a beautiful and innocent girl, who was ready for a slow and passionate relationship, but since our protagonist wants to speed things up he instead sleeps with his friend. This relationship continues, until his real girlfriend slowly spirals into a delusional state where she believes with all of her heart that everything is still okay.  
This show isn't bad because of poor writing, it's bad for supporting wrong behavior towards a relationship. 
Sidenote: I actually did care for the first half of the show, being how cringy it may have been, I supported the first bit of it. As the show went on though those feelings were crushed then faded away with any hope of coming back. 
Story: This show is about a girl desperately clinging to a dying relationship she has with her cheating boyfriend. The male party seems to be caught up in one of his best friends, along with a few other girls. As this goes on everyone starts to lose their morals and wither into a shell of what once was human. 
This story is about a pimp 
Characters: The characters themselves is probably going to be the most conflicting part of this review, for they weren't bad, just their actions are unjustifiable. The characters develop beautifully over the -- episodes. Everyone you've grown to know and hate finally bcome something you can't turn away from. Some characters you'll probably stick true to, for most if not all of the show. The characters are nice at first, but when emotions win over their minds, and when they lose mentality, that's when true character is displayed.  
Art & Sound: Overused music galore! Ever liked a song in a soundtrack so much that you would make it the song you listen to every day forever? Good cause this show offers bad music in each episode! As for the art, it has that old look, so it's a good pace from what we watch today. 
Overall: All I can really say is, if you want a mediocre show that has twists turns and is an emotional roller coaster, just watch to episode --.  
If you want to watch it to test your patience, to see if you can withstand the horror of this famously bad show, go for it, it's not as bad as you might think (it's still not good though) 
And if you're watching it just because it may have piqued your interest, I'm sorry just don't do it. 
Final warning, this show has not much good to offer, please continue at your own risk.

The movie itself is mediocre or at least not good on its own. Too much action but there isn't enough time to introduce or develop characters, hence not a good entry point for someone who wasn't familiar with the franchise. The pacing is rushed as if a season was condensed into --- minutes, and it ends with a cliffhanger for the sequel to solve. Generic Magical Girl x Mecha in its purest form (NOT Moe), no subversion, no parody, nothing degenerate either, just uninspiring. Looks like something from the ----s, or an addition to a franchise that has passed its golden days.

A departure from the TV series. This time around, it focuses on Horo's tsundere dere side to Laurence. However, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have the educational theme of the TV series. We all know how much we love the medieval economics knowledge *sarcasm*. 
Animation quality was almost unchanged from the TV series considering that this is an OVA. It's still Spice and Wolf. 
It was an enjoyable watch so I gave it a good rating.

The phrase of ""Dont judge book by its covers"" is really true. When we all seeing the short explanation by this anime, we're gonna imagining something great, magnificent, epic battles and stunning art. But in the end it was all just an illusion. Illusion that been made by this anime, summary we're being deceived. 
Mahou Sensou or Magical Warfare is anime that technically is about action and magic like the genre has said and thats it. If we're talking about plot, it hasnt. Well, at the first you would introduce that the world has two side world, first it was human world and the other one is wizard and whatever world. Then, somehow without any logical thinking, our MC is choosing to live in magician world just for helping one girl and moreover its the first time that they meet. 
The first time i watch this, i cant help to feel cliche and so pushed. Like one scenes that i said before, the MC is choosing to live in magician world just because he cant enjoyed living in his own house and feel urge to save someone he just met. Being heroic, is probably one of the good aspects that the MC must have but realistically speaking, even the stupid people would think twice to risking their live just for saving people. If the this MC called Takeshi have a good reason for it, then it doesnt matter but honestly all of the reason that he give is kinda illogical and another kind of illogical things is how kendo sword that been made wood is capable of fending off a real blade and moreover its a steel one. Oh god.  
Aside from logical thinking, another things that quite funny is how easily people can be affecting to use magic. I mean, in this anime the MC or Takeshi is a normal human being and the second later he become magician just because Mui Aiba (the heroine) using magic near of him. Its like ""you want to be a magician? then come here i will use my magic and you would become magician! yeah!"" 
Moving on to the art section, this is probably the worst aspects that this anime have. For anime that been adapted by Madhouse studio the one who brought you Hunter x Hunter (----), this anime's art is really horrible for anime that airing in ----. First how the characters design isnt consistent. When watching this, i cant help to notice that in every scenes they draw the characters so badly and something that doesn’t bode too well for an action/fantasy series such as this. Like sometimes, the face looks so awkward like it bents to the otherside.  
Another things that probably being controversial is how the character design is like from fate/series. In the opening song, you would see like a white saber with that armor and things, then there is this blonde guy called Kazumi Ida who is looking so similiar with Gilgamesh. For anime that been made by a big studios called Madhouse, surely this one is such a big failure. 
After all that, there is one thing that atleast ""normal"" and so so. It was the sound. There is nothing to much too mention in this term. Good things they have Mamoru Miyano for voicing Takeshi, as usual he did it well and really fits with the MC. For other seiyuus, they did well though i believe it wasnt something special. The one i like from this anime is the ED. Nano with their ""Born to be"" song is so epic, their fastbeat and energetic song makes this anime looks so epic though it wasnt happen. Such a shame. 
Last, the characters. The explanation that i said before maybe give you a glimpse about the characters in this anime. First, we have a ""heroic"" MC called Takeshi which is have a justice feeling and prepare to help anyone who need to help. ANYONE. At the first we would see that he have such a dark past and trying to make us curious. But honestly well, its failed. I dont understanding what happen in this anime so why would i need to curious about his dark past? and for some circumtances, he is dating with such a beautiful blonde girls named Kurumi Isoshima. She is just your typical tsundere girls, and at last, we have Mui Aiba, our main heroines. She is nothing special to being mention about this. Well, she have a gun. a GUN. Summary, the characters isnt likeable which is the most important things in anime to make the viewers enjoy to watch. They have nothing that makes us to like the characters, after all they all plain characters. 
After all that mubbling, i honestly feel guilty to writing this review. I dont want to judge the anime so badly but its just i cant bear it. I am not saying this anime is bad for all of you but in my perspective, this anime is bad though they have a lot of potentials in there. If you're liking action and magic with some cliche romance on it, probably this anime would suit you but honestly, there is still anime that is more better than this one.

""Even our favorite things in life have flaws. Even so, we continue to love them regardless."" 
As I thought of this generic, cheesy, probably already existing line, the first anime that came to mind was Eureka Seven. Not only because it's the main theme throughout the show regarding its characters and their relationships, but also because it perfectly describes my general thoughts on the show itself. 
Let me start off by pointing out where Eureka Seven truly shines. In my opinion that would be the general lively atmosphere and vibrant color palette. Man, this show is the definition of fun! The character designs are award-winningly awesome, the animation (while still having dips and hiccups here and there) is gorgeous, the background art mesmerizing. 
And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Not only are most of the OP/ED themes memorable, but the OST itself is FILLED with absolutely amazing, memorable tracks, most notably including catchy techno beats that fit surprisingly well with action scenes on one hand, and captivatingly ambient experimental rock tracks which make you feel like you're lifting on trapar waves without a care in the world on the other.  
Everything about Eureka Seven screams creativity, and you can tell that the whole project is filled with love and passion from its creators. 
All of these components give it that special, nostalgic feeling that kicks in as soon as you start the show and never goes away. 
I believe that this nostalgia in particular is what makes people love this show so much and sometimes even neglect the show's problems, which, if you manage to wake up from that ecstatic, youthful, pure fun feeling this show puts you in, you'll realize aren't that small. 
First of all, I'd like to point out the show's length. It's -- episodes long, which is not the most common length. Maybe one that you see once a year or once every - years. This relatively chunky length springs up - major problems. 
The first one is the fact that the show is filled with unnecessary filler. I'd dare say almost half of the show is weird, out of place slice-of-life stuff that drastically slows the story down. Now don't get me wrong, I'd take the development of the characters (most of which are, mind you, surprisingly deep and realistic already) over awkward, badly explained politics/military/sci-fi shenanigans we will get into later. However, most of the filler doesn't even develop the characters much, but instead puts them in weird, one-episode gag situations which end up serving little to no benefits to the story later on (for example the mission where Renton goes out in the field as an in-disguise spy, or the infamous soccer episode). 
The second problem which is sprung up by the length is the show's ""identity crisis"". What I mean by this is the fact that the show changes its core genre way too much. It starts off as a shounen-esque adventure story, but shortly after switches to an organization-based rebel story. Then, it starts really focusing on the characters' psyches and problems, which works fine until the show starts focusing on Renton's and Eureka's relationship, at which point the other parts of the story get more and more neglected and unexplained in order to focus on those two as much as possible. The show's final... let's say approximately third focuses on the sci-fi part of the story which still somehow manages to be outshined by the beloved Eureka-and-Renton part. That, combined with the aforementioned filler chunks make the pacing of the story feel like one big mess. 
I saved the most glaring problem for last, that being the sci-fi/politics/worldbuilding part of the show. Let's face it, it's not the smartest thing ever. Most concepts that are introduced (and there's many) are either explained very briefly/poorly and not in the most understandable way, or just... not explained at all. It's not uncommon while watching this show to start thinking things like ""Wait, am I supposed to understand what they're talking about? Did I miss something? Am I dumb for not understanding it?"" only to realize that you indeed were not supposed to understand it, at which point a character just pulls out a bunch of info out of nowhere. However, you then realize that if they knew that all along, they could have done something about some situations that have already happened beforehand, which then makes you pull out your hair in frustration because of how dumb these decent characters end up looking because of weird directing decisions. And yes, I do blame the aforementioned two problems for this one to a certain extent. If only the pacing was better and some of the filler left out, they would have been able to explain and flesh out these concepts properly and make them feel less dumb/shoehorned in. 
Final verdict: 
Eureka Seven is not a perfect show. Far from one, in fact. However, its real charm lays in its characters, world, atmosphere and just sheer fun factor. 
It's like that one game from your childhood that isn't anything amazing objectively, but it still feels special to you no matter when or how much you play it because it brings you back to those simpler, better times when you were just a daydreaming playful kid without a care in the world.  
It explores themes such as family, love, jealousy, happiness, loneliness, etc. in such a way that really makes you invested in these characters to the point where they end up feeling almost like best friends to you. 
When I look at the members of Gekkostate, I don't just see a bunch of fictional characters. I see a group of friends, a family, people who'll always be by my side no matter where I am. 
Renton, Eureka, Holland, Talho, Stoner, Hap, Mattheiu, Hilda, Maeter, Linck, Maurice, Moondoggie, Gidget, Mischa, Jobs, Woz, Ken-goh, Gonzy, and last but not least, Nirvash. They'll always hold a special place in my heart and I'll never forget the fun times I had on Gekko alongside all of them. 
That feeling is something that's really hard to find nowadays, even in the best of shows. That's why I think Eureka Seven deserves all of the love it gets, and why it should remain to be a timeless classic for all of eternity. 
Thank you for reading.

“Humans have a desire to know the truth. Or they have a desire to believe that what they know is the truth.” 
I first watched Bakemonogatari - years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I found it to be a quirky and refreshing take on the harem genre with some interesting Japanese folklore thrown in. I later decided to watch Nise and was much less satisfied, although there were moments of true greatness present (I particularly enjoyed the scene with Mayoi in the first episode). While I thought of the Monogatari series as ""good"" at this point, I never understood why it was considered to be great. Why time and time again I had been recommended it by several friends. I never saw the series fulfill its true potential. 
Monogatari Second Season surpasses any expectations I could have ever had for such an experience. 
A recurring trend throughout this season is arcs focused on narration from a perspective different from the protagonist of Araragi that has become the normalcy for the series. I will come outright and say that this decision is a genius one, and the series is elevated to a completely new height everytime Araragi is out of the picture. I don't actively dislike him, in fact I did enjoy the two arcs he had this season, but the three in which he is barely present are without a doubt some of the strongest stories I've seen told through anime. 
Hanekawa Tsubasa takes the helm at the first arc, and from her viewpoint we see a new side of both herself and series staple(hah) Senjougahara. Its touching to see their friendship that has developed, even if it had at first only started as a result of Senjou's fear of Hanekawa. Hanekawa's narration is thoughtful and flows elegantly; very reflective of her intelligent personality. I will say I was not very invested in the supernatural aspects of this arc but Hanekawa's development comes to a nice close here. 
Here's where we get to the good stuff: Nadeko Medusa. This is where my opinion on the Monogatari series as a whole would change forever. This arc manages to deliver the complete unexpected without relying on shock value or anything as shallow as the sort. Nadeko's perspective and experiences with the rest of the cast had my opinion towards them shift drastically, I actively disliked the people around her for treating her this way. I wanted her to fight back. I wanted her to kill Araragi and his smug ass companion. This shift is something I've never really felt before in a show, and it could only have been accomplished with such a different point of view as Nadeko's. Truly excellent anime. 
You may think the past paragraphs have been my true opinions on the series but no, you're completely wrong. Those arcs are mere time wasters, comparative to trash, when brought up against Hitagi End. Kaiki is the best goddamn character I've come across in years. He completely changes the show with his presence; raising every single character he talks with to a new height and revealing their flaws - even those of the perfect Senjou - for all to see. Hearing the cynical viewpoint of the previous season's villain as he narrates his tale of lies and deceit is an experience I will never forget. Truly enjoyable anime that every fan of the medium has a right to see. Nadeko's character arc comes to a surprising and, honestly, inspiring end here as well. And Kaiki ends the arc with fulfilling his promise of acting as an unreliable narrator by killing himself, the reluctant protagonist we have come to love, off in the most unfulfilling and boring way possible. Except he didn't die, as he appears at a much later date in the series. Kaiki cons you out of the ending you desired. Fucking brilliant. 
Anyways this is really all just late night ramblings after I finished a great series that I wanted to talk about, and the score I've given is pretty meaningless, I don't really believe one's enjoyment can be measured by a numerical value alone. What matters is I enjoyed this show a hell of a lot.

I'm really glad I decided to take the time to watch this anime. With just a short -- episodes, it's a really awesome show to watch if you're taking a break from watching --+ ones.  
Story = --/-- 
The storyline itself is pure genius. The plot, the strategy and the ending to the whole thing was just perfect. A whole world were everything is decided upon playing a game. These games range from chess to poker to video-games! I found that I was very easily able to relate to the two main characters. And I love the fact that they are brother and sister. 
It is a little bit cheeky however ( I personally don't mind ecchi at all, i think it's quite cute ) but never the less, the storyline is still gripping and vastly over powers the naughty bits. 
Art = --/-- 
The colours are so vibrant, bright and lively. There is a heavenly feel to the way the colours contrast with the lights and the whole thing just fits in perfectly. Beautiful and elegantly drawn and mastered into an anime show. 
Sound/Music = --/-- 
I'm a huge fan of the ambient music in general, and this anime was not a let down for me in that category. The opening and closing songs are so beautiful and the music throughout the show fitted into each scene perfectly. 
Character = -/-- 
This is the ONLY thing that I feel let down on. I really wanted to know more about the different characters and how they came to be. We did get some back story on Sora and Shiro, also with Stephanie Dola. But I just...wanted more. Maybe I'm just a sucker for heart felt back stories because I always want to know why a character is a certain way, what happened to them in their childhood? What was their family like? And so on. 
Other than that, the characters were very well put across, I really loved each and every one of them. 
Enjoyment = --/-- 
I REALLY love this anime! I do hope they decide to make a second season. I want to see more of Sora and Shiro ""Blank"" making their way to defeat the God ""Tet"". 
Most short anime series always leave me feeling a tiny bit disappointed at the end, but with this it was ended on a HUGE cliffhanger, so season -? possiblehh?! xD

Spirited Away comes from the great Miyazaki. Of all of his films, this is his most well-known and perhaps most beloved as well. The story follows a girl who enters a mysterious world full of creatures and demons. It is about both hope and finding happiness in the heart of a child. 
PROS 
The art here is as good as it could be, for its time. The characters, in particular, really come alive as the story progresses. Buildings and creatures seem real, as if they could come out of the screen and touch you. This adds a lot to the fantasy element of Spirited Away. The viewer becomes entranced by all of the animation and stays in a dreamlike state for the entire movie. Truly mesmerizing visuals. 
Characters are brought up early and later on in the anime. Some of them are good, and some are bad. All, though, are very unique in terms of personality. The main girl has the best character of all, which is no surprise to those who know about the past work of Ghibli - the studio behind this project.  
CONS 
The only negative of this movie is that the visuals, while impressive, have died down a bit since the film first came out. This may be a problem to some, though I would hope not. It still is an amazing thing to look at, whether you have high standards or not.  
OVERALL 
I didn't have much to say about Spirited Away due to the fact that everyone has pretty much had their say on this great film. It's a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. I encourage both parents and their children to seek this film out, preferably on Blu-Ray (if it's available). This is a must have!

Having been told to watch Berserk a number of times, and having it on my ""Plan to Watch"" list for a good three years, I finally broke down and watched it. Needless to say that though there a lot of things I didn't like about the series, the overall feeling I got from it was enough to floor me and leave me thinking about it for days. 
Story: Probably one of the strongest aspects of the series is the outstanding story. It follows a man named Guts and his journey to aid a military mercenary group go on a path that will bring the world to their feet. The overarching military motif, fitted with the stirring character drama was paced fluently and always made you want to know what happened next. 
Art and Sound: While the art may seem dated at first, it comes together in the end. The sound is incredibly, it offers a stirring soundtrack that completely marries the importance of each scene and warrants several repeat listens. 
Enjoyment: Like I said the pacing, character development and all the different elements all came together perfectly. Very few anime grip me like this one did. I plan to rewatch it several time and get into the manga. 
Overall: An absolute must watch for any fan of mature, action like series'.

Monster is a story that focuses on the questions ""What really makes a monster?"". It follows a doctor (Kenzou Tenma) in pursuit of the truth and to save lives. 
Story: Monster's story is very dark and focuses on - main characters each in pursuit of a specific goal. Good and evil people are presented often in the story and can within seconds change from a wonderful person to a terrible ""Monster"". The story is mostly a  psychological and mystery with elements of action here as well some fantastic drama. Monster's characters are also well written and each one of them add an interesting and new perspective to the story. From the start to the end this story will keep you thinking ""Who really is the monster"".  
Characters: There are - main characters in Monster, they are Kenzou Tenma, Heinrich Lundge, Eva Heinemann, and the twins Anna and Johan Liebert. 
Kenzou Tenma: Is a brilliant brain surgeon who values all human life equally and wants to save everyone he can. After a series of murders with him labeled as the prime suspect Tenma tries to find out exactly who is the murderer and how to stop him. 
Eva Heinemann: A women who just wants a happy life and when her perfect life is taken from her after a series of murders happens, searches for a way to get vengeance and for happiness. 
Heinrich Lundge: a brilliant BKA agent that has had such success believes without a doubt he is always right and after a series of murders occur, he relentlessly searches for the one he believes is the culprit. 
Anna and Johan Liebert: After a series of murders, these mysterious twins disappear without a trace, these twins are  key to solving the mystery behind everything that has happened. 
All of these characters are excellently written as well as the great supporting characters to. 
Art and Sound: the openings and closings fit the show very well and the art is well done to with nice animation nicely drawn characters and greatly made scenes. 
Enjoyment: Throughout the show I was amazed at how much it keeps you wanting more and how it keeps you guessing what happens next. Since the show's many characters are all different and have their own morals and perspectives you will likely find one that you like to see more of throughout the story. 
Overall: Monster is a wonderful show for any fans of horror, mystery, psychological and drama. Its a great show from beginning to end and will keep you wondering ""what really makes a monster?""

The story was cute yet simple. It didn't need any dramatic scenes for it to be interesting and that's what made the movie so perfect.  
The animation was so pleasing to the eyes and it's one of the reasons why I fell in love with the anime. 
Kusakabe and Sajou's lovestory was so heartwarming and adorable I was legit squealing every time they kissed.  
Not only that but the music was a great touch to the movie and it fit into the scenes so well. 
Overall, I recommend to anyone who just wants a feel-good movie in which the characters and deeply in love with each other.

The holidays had just begun when I chose to crack open this anime, the summary sounding cute enough and the reviews close to overflowing with greatness and I was looking into the fall anime which I had neglected. 
But little did I expect to be sorely disappointed. 
Story: 
This anime isn't terrible persay, though I would say that it has been greatly overestimated. The story is unrelatable and unrealistic and I don't mean this in the ""GIANT MECHA AND SPARKLY COLOURS"" way, but in the ""There is no way this could be seen as a real life situation, it's just so silly"" way. 
Now, a quick overview of the story's good parts. Ahem.....uh....err.....oh yeah, THIS ANIME DOESN'T HAVE A STORY! Girl meets boy, girl is stupid, boy is also stupid, girls life changes for the better, maybe throw a rival in there. The end. This is hardly a story and I've been far to generous with my rating. 
Art: 
Art is decent, it's nothing spectacular though, the style has been used a hundred times before; more effectively and even in a way that would make the anime seem to have a little more depth, but it would appear this anime didn't really try, relying alot on still frames rather than trying something different or even having consistent movement. 
Sound: 
Well, I won't complain, it has a fair opening and ending theme and they include basic intrumental and background noises that are a staple for any anime but, again, it would appear that this anime hasn't even tried at times. 
Character: 
The characters are flat in terms of personality, though they do provide some sorely need comic relief at times, particularly the women the main character adopts as her friends and their homeroom teacher, but everyone else is just placid. The love interest is nice enough though the girl does nothing but angst then smile, angst then smile, etc. and becomes one of those people that makes you want to punch a wall because she's so ignorant; even if you were completely isolated from people, you don't lose common sense as a result, either that or she suffers from severe brain damage, though that isn't covered in the anime so I'll just resign myself to believing that she's just stupid. 
Enjoyment: 
I really can't say much, I wasn't necessarily suffering, but alot of the time I found myself banging my head against my desk because every decision made by the characters were so stupid, obvious and often dragged out with scenes of the main character blushing while giving dialogue that's been heard hundreds of times by her before. 
Overall: 
I understand that this anime has earnt many fans and I can understand this, I enjoy seeing some clumsy shoujo anime every now and again, because clumsy is cute and even heartwarming, but this anime has been given far too much credit when there are anime out there with far more innovative stories, characters, art, etc. 
By all means watch it, but don't take it seriously, it's just a ""something to do"" anime.

This show I picked up mostly because the community swore the light novels were pretty good and the plot seemed intriguing. Honestly though, the whole thing just felt… off. Which is hilarious because a huge theme of this show is things working together in harmony, like gears in a clock (subtle, light-novel sensei). It was like the show couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. One moment we’re having these decent gun fights and things are all intense and serious, and the next we have an android offering to use her lap as a pillow for the MC like it’s a harem anime. 
But probably my biggest problem with this show was the whole /r/iamverysmart feeling that the main characters gave me. The MC has super hearing and has to wear noise cancelling headphones to have a normal conversation with someone (yes, really), and the main girl is a supposed “genius” who is constantly one-upped by the MC. I could have maybe accepted their behavior a little more if they were older, but we’re talking about preteens who come off as bratty and patronizing at best. I swear, both the MC and main girl went through a cycle of Problem -> Solution -> New Problem -> Immense, Immediate Depression -> Other Person Telling Them it’s Daijoubu -> Solution all the way up until the finale. 
That isn’t to say that it was all bad, though. The animation was decent, and watching the few fire fights were actually pretty awesome at times. And while the fanservice is shoehorned in at awkward places, it’s still decent fanservice. I know what I’m on about, son. If you aren’t too concerned about plot, this might be worth checking out. 
My MAL Score: -/--.

I am a very big Inazuma Eleven fan that's watching the series since it came out first time in my country in France in ---------. I was super young and still I enjoyed it a lot, and when I saw it back in ---- before Ares no Tenbin starts airing, I got in it even more, and since it became my fucking life. I actually have put a -- at the original Ina-- series, so what the hell is wrong with Ares ? 
I'll surely be comparing Ares a lot with the original series so if you haven't watch it... Well I don't even know why you're watching Ares if you did not watch the original series. 
Let's start with the story. In my mind, that's a nice story, but in the end, it feels... not finished. Ares sure has a sequel which is Orion no Kokuin and is still airing when I'm writing this, but the story is totally different; the plot of Orion is centered on a new character, Mitsuru Ichihoshi (as of now), while the plot of Ares is centered on one of the three characters, Nosaka Yuuma. It feels unfinished and I hate that; as of the fact that when Ares was at its --th episode, I asked myself a thousand of questions about the plot, the next of the story, that still aren't answered : who's Asuto's father that his mom's letter was teasing about, who in the end was the guy controling all the Ares programme, has he got any background story or is he just a ""bad, evil character"", why did Kazemaru become so d-rk and what happened to him, and most of all, why the fuck did they tease Natsumi while she just appeared in a text Aki received in the LAST episode. The bad thing with Ares's story is the fact they took way too much episodes to talk about the soccer matches, and there is no background story when they are playing. Some hissatsus popping, here and here, and so it makes the story way less enjoyable and/or alive. Might I also say the backstories are something that almost doesn't exist in this anime. Except for the main characters (and if you call seeing Asuto as a baby a backstory), there is not a single backstory. Also, the plot is centered on only one of the three main characters; Nosaka Yuuma. The only question I got over Asuto was about his father, (as the fact of making his mother die in the FIRST episode was purely for drama and I don't understand what's different with her dead or alive) and I feel like Haizaki's backstory was so much not interesting and that the Akane part was more part of Nosaka's backstory than Haizaki's. 
So about the story, I'd say nice but way not enough to just say ""good"". May it be that I still have the original series in my mind that were way better. 
Ares's graphisms are really good and they look awesome. I have nothing to say about the quality. Tho, something did not please me with the graphisms. As it surely is way better drawn than the original series, the proportions are way better for their age and some things are much more satisfying, they are not that much just because we're in a Inazuma Eleven anime. I was deceived because I really thought I was going to find the old graphisms of ---- again; and I feel like it kind of made Inazuma less enjoyable to watch. The color palettes are not the same and are less satisfying to the eye of a ~-----born child. Here I'd say, the older the better. 
Resuming, I really liked the graphisms but they do not fit a Ina-- anime... 
Soundtracks are litteraly the same as in the original series and that's why I noted it that high. Only new OP and ED; I liked the two, to be honest, even tho it felt weird to have a Ina-- OP not made by T-Pistonz+KMC. It surely isn't that awesome to use the same soundtracks, but I really was gone again in the Inazuma Eleven mood because of the soundtrack; Ina--'s soundtracks always sounded unique. 
Character developpement is pityful. Really. I've been really deceived. Only the three main characters and Akane got a bit developped ; not even the main team. We do not know anything about --% of the characters of these series. They're all blank characters with not-so-original designs, except for the ones that appears a little bit more than for one match, and the blank characters that got popular got to be only because they are around one of the mains. (exemple: Mizukamiya always around Haizaki) Again, they haven't took enough time to develop the character because of how many matches there are and how long they are too. Even the ones that love Ares as fuck are okay on that point; the characters are not developped at all. Hiura Kirina, that kinda was the new Kazemaru, in the end got as important as Handa in the original series. You feel like Ares's world is only composed of - human characters always around soccer player bots. 
I did not enjoy watching Ares at all. Again : the matches. Too much. Too long. Not enough backstories. Not enough story/character development. Not enough casual life... You feel like there is ONLY soccer matches and that's making me tired. The training sessions/story development take around - minutes for -- minutes of matches in one episode. It makes everything boring and all. In the end, the only episode I truly enjoyed was the last one and it to be honest left a good image of Ares in my mind, tho it wasn't that impressive in the end. I only have watch Ina-- with GO! and CS apart from Ares, Reloaded and the Outer Codes, and EVERYTHING was way more enjoyable... I am truly deceived by Ares. 
Overall, Ares is pretty much mediocre, poor. It doesn't feel like a Ina-- anime, it's not developped at all, and it feels like match spamming for showing super-duper-not-so-badass hissatsu techniques. Also, little thought of mine ; I think taking the original Raimon team would have made this way better, because the development would have already been done and there would be more screentime for new charas/story plot... 
I think Ares is only good to watch when you really have watched all the other Inazuma Eleven animes and are curious about it because nothing more to watch... But there is clearly no interest watching it before the original series; not a single one. 
(sorry if there is any English mistake in my review!)

This one caught me off guard. I was expecting a somewhat lighthearted anime, the usual romcom type. I was pleasantly surprised however. Also please keep in mind that this is my first review and I'm still relatively new to anime.  
Story 
The story is driven by the five main characters, the different phenomenons that happen throughout the series and how they affect their relations. This is due to Balloon Vine (a weird ""being"" that can take control of people's bodies) causing the phenomenons. Sometimes a few side characters are involved, but they are usually only there to add a bit of comedy. That is fine, as the main characters are well designed and not paper thin.  
Characters 
I really liked the characters. Even though they are based on existing archetypes, they manage to bring something new here. They build each character from ground up, showing their problems and pasts. The characters definitely are the thing that kept me interested. I'm not gonna spoil anything, as the story depends on character development. All the characters go through some change during the series. 
Yaegashi Taichi - He's your typical nice guy type character. I'm usually not big on them, often ending up hating them. However, this one was different, without spoiling anything. 
Nagase Iori - She's the cute and energetic type. At least, she starts out as one.  
Kiriyama Yui - She's your delicate character and a karate trainee. 
Inaba Himeko - She's the tough, cool chick. Again, changes during the show. Also my favourite character.  
Aoki Yoshifumi- I suppose he's the pervert type. That is not flaunted though, only in a few instances does he act perverted. He also gets beaten up by the girls.  
Art 
No complaints here. I'm not too picky on art, as long as it's watchable, which it most definitely was. It was clear, not that detailed though. I feel like it does the job. Art isn't a deal breaker for me anyway.  
Sound 
I don't care much for anime openings or endings, so I'll let you judge those. The actual music during the show was really good and fitting, though. The VAs did a good job in my opinion, no complaints.  
Enjoyment 
I really enjoyed Kokoro. I was always wanting to see what's going to happen next, watching all of the -- episodes on almost one sitting. There were no filler episodes, never a dull moment. The pacing was perfect in my opinion, it didn't feel rushed nor did it feel like it was dragging on too long. The conclusion in the end was satisfying and I didn't feel like it should've continued. Kokoro is definitely going to my top - ever, possibly the best I've watched so far.  
I can't really say anything bad about this series. I did get annoyed a few times when the characters did something stupid a real person would never have done, but that's just me, not bad design necessarily. I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you're not a big SoL fan. If you want to shed a few tears while watching a good story unfold, go for it!

暗殺教室 (Assassination Classroom) is one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched. Nothing in this show failed to surprise me in the slightest, even going so far to bring in plot points you have long forgotten about. 
The story of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu never slows down. Whilst many animes with -- episodes love to add filler episodes to fill up space, this anime uses these 'filler episodes' to make you learn more about the characters - and boy, is there a lot of characters to learn about. 
Art style is refreshing. I have not yet seen another anime with the sort of comic-book style the show resonates. Very unique, yet not overly complicated for its own good. 
The sound - more off, the music - is what you expect in a show about assassination. It builds tension and pays off with a realistic situation - or even humorous one. The voice acting in both sub and dub are well done, but as an English speaker, I kept with the dub. It did not ruin the experience for me. 
The characters are all separate and each have their flaws and weaknesses. E Class is full of teenagers, rejected by the school they chose to be taught in, simply because they behave differently with the common agenda. The teachers of E Class, including Kuro-sensei, are teachers I wish I had whilst I was in high school. Likable and good at counseling - while keeping their own skills apart of them. 
The only gripe I have with the characters of this anime - and why characters are not --/-- - is the non-E Class school children. Sure, they are despicable, however nothing else can be said about their personalities. They are not as rounded as I wanted them to be and it is a shame, considering how rounded the main characters are. 
Enjoyment. Holy shit, this anime made me laugh out loud so many times. It is a perfect blend of humorous tension and real life tension, all mixed into a lovely fluffy dough. Most animes seem to dump its message in the name of humor, however this anime did not, keeping its message of 'never giving up, even in the face of defeat' whilst adding humor that all age groups can laugh at. The characters are beaten down, get up, crack a one liner, and bite back. I love this show because of that. 
Overall, this is a total recommendation for anyone who wants a fun, yet relateable anime. You will not regret spending -- episodes with E Class and, of course, Kuro-sensei.

As you probably already know, competitive spirit, teamwork, communication, and perseverance are all common themes that unite the sports genre as a whole. Therefore, to truly differentiate one show from other similar shows, scriptwriters need to engage the audience in a remarkably new and refreshing way. 
I think for some people, this show is able to connect with them on some deeper, meaningful level. The way that this show engages with its audience is truly something else. The way Karasuno interacts, the way they crack jokes, and their never-ending drive to succeed – it makes you feel excited. It’s as if you are there physically with them, cheering the underdogs on as they take on the world around them. 
For me, I appreciate how some individuals who were disregarded in the first season are now given much more depth. Consider Tsukishima, for instance. After losing to their ever-so-favorite rivals, the Karasuno team is rebuilding as a team and honing their skills by attending training camps. It is during this when Tsukishima’s time to shine came. In a single episode, we learned why Tsukishima is so deeply affected by his brother’s betrayal and why Tsukishima is such a lone wolf. Thanks to a push by his close friend Yamaguchi, Tsukishima finally learns the true meaning of teamwork, and, from this, he begins to participate in team-building activities (i.e. playing mini-games against with other schools in the training camp). In the first season, you know he would never ever do something like this. It is very fortunate that Tsukishima decided to change; if he didn’t, he would never have been able to hone his skillset, which becomes especially important during the spring qualifiers. Another example: Ennoshita. He becomes a key motivator for the team. He has some big shoes to fill, and he would never have been in this position if it weren’t for Daichi. 
Another thing that I really liked about what Haikyuu is how the antagonists (i.e. Karasuno’s rivals) are also characterized. How many shows out there have you watched where you have had one-dimensional villains (or antagonists or bad guys or whatever you want to call them) that you couldn’t relate to? Too many, right? Fortunately, Haikyuu breaks away from this by giving a lot of the antagonists some serious backstory. Most of the time we are able to learn what volleyball means to the rival, what kind of a team player they are, and why the match means so much to them. 
But there’s only one major downside that I can think of: there’s an obvious imbalance regarding the characters. Haikyuu has a tendency to characterize just one individual at a time. People who were given a decent amount of screen time during the first season (e.g. Nishinoya) are suddenly ignored this season; others (e.g. Hinata and Kageyama) decrease in significance. On the other hand, some of the second year benchwarmers still get no screen time. It’s a shame, really. If the show were able to balance out its characters better, we would have been able to understand better how the team operates as a whole and see much more team synergy as a result. 
Now moving onto the plot – the plot is more of a mixed bag, to be honest. Yes, it’s exciting to some degree, but the pacing of the plot is not Haikyuu’s strongest point. It’s rather sluggish, and it’s usually due to the following factors: 
- The characters talk a lot. Like a lot. Imagine you and your best friend talking. Multiply that by --. 
- They all think a lot too. They are trying to anticipate their opponents. 
- The characters are given a backstory. 
- Characters are trying new flashy moves. Groovy. 
- Sensei is playing the “I’m new to volleyball please explain everything to me” or the “listen to my wise words” role for you. 
- The team that Karasuno is playing against is surging ahead in number of points, and the characters are trying to think of a way to fight back. 
- Or they’re literally just hitting the ball back and forth endlessly. Who’s going to get the point?  
This constant pattern causes each major match drags out over --- episodes. I’m not entirely sure if this is necessary – although they are all technically well-incorporated, there is a point when you become impatient and want to know what the results of the match are. As for non-matches, there is sometimes extraneous information that really serve no purpose in the context of the show. I wouldn’t say -- minutes of eating BBQ after a nice, long training camp and male volleyball players commenting on the superficial looks of the high schools’ assistant managers was necessary. 
And then there’s plot armoring. I really hate to say it, but for shows like these, plot armoring is inevitable (would you want to keep watching a team that keeps losing? Unless you’re a diehard fan, I didn’t think so), so it really is a question of how well-balanced it is. It is easy to say, “You know, they deserve it, they’ve been working hard as a team” and allow the underdogs to keep winning consecutive matches. Fortunately, for Haikyuu, plot armoring is heavily restricted to what is absolutely necessary. For instance, Karasuno doesn’t have to win every practice match (as an audience member, however, I know you’re secretly praying for them to win. Don’t worry, I did that too) and good thing they don't – otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to learn from their mistakes. 
Now briefly for one more positive thing about the plot: there's humor and it's well-incorporated throughout the show. Haikyuu would have been utterly flat without it. The way the characters interact and make fun of each other came off as very natural. It kept the ball rolling, especially when things got extremely sluggish. 
Art and sound were all excellent. Animation was done very well by Production I.G (see Ao Haru Ride, Kuroko No Basket, and Kimi ni Todoke), although nothing was truly that remarkable. For sound, the OP was very moving and embodied the whole competitive spirit. Voice acting was decent too for the context of this show. 
So is it the best sports anime ever? Eh, debatable. It has a lot to offer in terms of characters and will keep you on your toes, but the show is terribly paced. Given this, if you thoroughly enjoyed the first season, don’t worry; you will like the second season too due to its similar execution. 
Now that that’s all out of the way, it was a fun ride when it lasted. I can’t wait to see what the third season has in store for us. 
Overall: B 
Author's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis. 
It should also be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.

Serving as Satoshi Kon's directorial debut for an anime, Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller focused on pop idol turned actress Mima Kirigoe finding her career transition to be a rather horrific one as she finds herself suffering from apparent psychosis and dealing with a demented fan who is not exactly thrilled with her retirement as a pop idol. 
As a psychological thriller, Perfect Blue makes effective use of scene transitions and cuts to simulate Mima's apparent warped state of mind. The film transitions between different scenes of the drama TV series that Mima stars in and her actual life to mess with the viewer's perception of events, much in the same way Mima is experiencing. This makes for an effective use of cinematography as the film's plot features some horrific murders that take place throughout its run that keep viewers guessing throughout the film if Mima may have crossed the line with committing them or if her stalker did such. The film also makes for an effective mystery as despite its warped style of storytelling, hints are dropped about what is really going on and who is responsible for the murders that take place. When the ending unveils who is responsible for the murders and the stalking, everything comes into place rather smoothly if you  are able to follow the hints seen throughout the film and not be fooled with dealing with Mima's mental breakdown that the cinematography subjects you to. 
Outside of the thriller plot, Perfect Blue also paints a rather believable focus on the challenges and hardships that come into play with both being a pop idol and transitioning into being an actress. Unlike many anime that glamorize both professions where you become instantly famous and get to such a point easily with hard work, Perfect Blue shows off both as having their hardships and complications that can occur. Mima's old pop idol band, Cham, are clearly shown to be struggling to connect with audiences at the start of the film and struggle to find large venues to afford them the opportunity to connect with larger audiences. In addition, Mima's desire to transition from being a pop idol to an actress does not go over well with many of her fans and is a highly stressful one as she tries having bigger roles within the drama she stars in which crosses into more mature territory with its content than what she experienced as a pop idol. For anyone unaccustomed to the Japanese pop idol scene, many fans of this industry are known to have a preconceived image of purity that they tack on to the pop idols that they follow where they do not have boyfriends or take part in any sexually-driven roles. With her new acting career, Mima finds herself trying to distance herself from such notions to advance her career and this further alienates her from the fans that followed her since her time with Cham. 
Visually, Perfect Blue makes use of Satoshi Kon's realistic drawing style. Unlike many anime titles that normally make all their characters look visually attractive with the same-looking facial designs, Kon depicts a wider variety of facial designs and body types in the designs of his characters with realistic proportions applied to them. While not as heavily emphasized, the animation for the film is fluid for the most part with characters demonstrating natural movement without any noticeable shortcuts or loss of detail.  
As Satoshi Kon's first work, Perfect Blue is an excellent demonstration of many of the filming elements that would be found with Kon's later works with its cerebral cinematography and realistic drawing style. The film is an effective mystery-thriller that screws with the audience's perception of events taking place due to Mima's mental breakdown and the ongoing mystery of the string of murders taking place. Do be warned that the film is intended for mature audiences due to its intense violence, attempted rape scenes, intense language, and graphic nudity. Otherwise if you have the stomach to handle a mature psychological thriller, Perfect Blue is a highly recommended film to check out.

“Hmm…I wonder how he’ll mind f—k me this time?” — Krunchyman 
While the narrative shuffling between film (i.e. fiction) and reality seemed a bit jarring, it simply disguised the insipidness in the overall theme being pushed forward.  Sure, it’s a creative method of presenting a “love” story, but it felt, more or less, forced down the viewer’s throat.  Let us remember that Chiyoko fell in “love” with this fellow after a brief encounter, then decided to concentrate all of her effort on chasing him down for the rest of her life.  But is anyone that “psychotic” to devote their entire life for a person they hardly know?  Haven’t we learned from our own and/or other’s experiences, that love is fickle, and emotions have a high likelihood of changing, particularly over an extended period of time?  Furthermore, the whole notion of finding your “one” true love is sort of a redundant narrative in the industry of cinema, making it a disappointment that the talented Satoshi Kon chose such a prosaic theme for one of his “landmark” films. 
In terms of the remaining characters in the film, they were nothing to write home about.  In fact, the insertion of Genya (the interviewer) and Kyoji (the cameraman) into the movie scenes of Chiyoko’s past seemed inessential to the plot, making their presence awkward and unwanted.  Additionally, the faux attempts at comedy did not meld well with the solemn action sequences.  It gave the impression that Mr. Kon was attempting to indulge a subset of the audience that might not otherwise watch his films in the first place.  That being said, however, he alienated a sizable segment of moviegoers that do not hold an affinity the anime genre. 
In his magnum opus (Perfect Blue), Kon did a wonderful job of detaching himself from the cliched stigma’s of the anime industry, producing a work that was truly remarkable; unfortunately, he seemed to regress in his later works.  Perhaps the changing paradigm of the industry seeped into his unconsciousness, altering his approach in ways he was not cognizant of — similar to one of his characters in his movies.

This is a brief review. 
As far as i can tell, this isekai anime is a waste of your valuable time. I had spare time during summer vacation so i watched a few episodes. But it was painfully bad. The animation is bad, sound is bad, story is cliche, nothing new, not enjoyable and character development is not even there. Better Animes are out there this season worth some of your time instead of this. 
At times, i hated myself for wasting my time on this.  
The reason i gave it - out of -- is that it is not total garbage. You can watch it and feel nothing. There are some out there such that of you watch them, you feel pain. It feels like you are better off dead. Those Animes deserve lower rating. And some are enjoyable and fun like konosuba.

Ergo Proxy 
An anime that makes sense but at the same time it doesn't, even when answers are given in the last three eps. i was thinking of the things that are not answered and there are supernatural elements, a lot and Deus Ex explanations but still manages to be entertaining. 
Story 
This anime has a very good story, since the beginning the story is thrown for ten episodes straight, fast paced with complexity, until when it takes a break to put filler episodes which were really good and had little pieces of the plot, especially the ''who wants to be a proxy'' episode where i was constantly interacting saying the answers just like Vincent, but how did they get there in the first place? ; The ''Disney World'' episode is another example, it was a filler but a really touching one, Pino became my favorite character of the anime with that episode, (dethroning Vincent from the first place) she is a hero; Every episode has a jump time, and with an annoying Re-i (really, she was bitchy) you never know how they reached some locations, like in ep. -- where all of a sudden they are back, what, is this a dream?, i thought it was, because the anime in those filler eps. is constantly playing between reality and dreams, is cool because i was fooled on this ep. thinking ''plot twist, is a dream'' but no. There is lack of coherent explanation as to why this gaps between eps. or how some events happened. The ending is good but unsatisfaying for some reason, it has a conclusion but at the same time open for another story, i have a lot of thing to complain storywise but this is not a complaint thread, at the end Pino still is a Hero and she is an AuotoReiv with more emotions than Re-i. 
Art & Animation 
I was expecting something darker for this kind of setting, a much dense atmosphere, that way would be better for me, but for what we got is very good, sometimes feels lazy with some shots at the faces and lookig at how they suffer from strabismus, it was hilarious, almost always with Re-i, i don't like the constant changing on the faces while moving from one angle to another and i'm saying every - cm move is a different face, despite this inconveniences it was very good for that year. 
Sound 
Maybe the best element from the anime, the music is great when is played after the silent parts, it sets a great atmosphere, it fits the theme, the OP is really great, the video clip reminded me of the --'s movies and TV series (like Buffy, Angel and specially to Charmed and the song a lot to Smallville) it was great, better than those series too, more emotion in just four words ''Come and save me'' while Vincent is screamig, just great and the ED is ok i guess, Radiohead, you get it. The VA is great as well, really enjoyable even when Re-i acted like a spoiled Brat, that voice was fitting, so good portraying that personality. 
Character 
The characters were pretty entertaining with the combination of really great voice acting, personalities and back stories for the characters, Re-i is the exception, she needed more background to get to know her more but she was ok. 
-Vincent Law is great, he suffers a transition from a nerdy looking shy guy who likes Re-i to a good-normal looking shy guy looking for his identity who still likes Re-i and cares and protects for Pino, he is a badass too, you'll see. 
-Re-I, Lilu or Real is a gal who can be emotionless at times, she acts like a brat later, really spoiled and that's because her AutoReiv does almost everything for her (love the part where he was ''arguing'' with her in the snow, the truth was spoken) but she kind of grows and even feels something for Vincent, she gets better, but not enough. 
-Pino is the best character, she's simple the best, the one that makes you laugh in every situation, she is adorable, naive, she even has more emotions than Re-i or every human and is impressive because she's an AutoReiv, she is a hero, she saves people believe it or not, the best character, i was thinking if something bad happened to her (in those eps. that could go bad) i was going to give this a bad score just because of that, wouldn't be the same without her. 
The support characters are great too, Raul, Daedalus, Iggy, they all are great, there are a lot more that are interesting too. In general the characters were great. 
Enjoyment 
I really had a very good enjoyment from this anime, i was expecting more tho, after everyone saying Ergo Proxy was better than Texhnolyzed, i was expecting something more darker and heavier, but i didn't felt that, maybe a little dense just at the last three eps. but i see that this has better art style and character development and has a ''happy'' ending while Tex. has a tragic one and has no filler eps. and is more slow paced but for me both are equally entertaining, both are must watch.

Clannad: after story is probably the best thing on earth. You can ask pretty much anyone who has seen this show ( grown men and women alike ), and they will admit to you that they cried like a baby while watching this. That includes me. There are moments in this show where you'll think "" no they would never do that "" and then they do it. There are moments where you'll think "" no they would never do that again"" and they do it. Other than the sadness there is a great deal of fun and comedy throughout the show, and its spread out pretty consistently and evenly ( for the most part ). If you haven't seen this show than you should go watch it right now. Stop reading this dumb ass review and go watch it. If you gave up during Clannad or just weren't that impressed well than you're an idiot, but also yeah after story is much much much better. I cant think of any negatives other than the art is a bit dated and a little off putting at first to to the unfortunate decision in the art department where some guy wanted the eyes where the nose should be. But you grow to like it. I also prefer the English dub as Sunoharas screams are very very funny in English. So yeah just go watch it pretty much.

Back when I was --- years old, someone had introduced me to this anime while I was just getting into anime, using it as an excuse for my doctors to not cut off my medical insurance, since I now had a reason to live. Anyway, this anime is brilliant from start to finish. Spike Spiegal (the main character) is one of the greatest anime characters ever created, with his amazing back story, and his cool laid back demeanor when it comes to fighting or collecting bounties. He is supported by Jet Black, a former ISSP cop named the ""Black Dog"", or whatever you'd like to call him, Faye Valentine, a -- year old bounty hunter with a gambling addiction who has a debt that can can make the U.S national debt look like a fucking joke compared to what she's lost, and Edward, a -- year old computer hacker who hasn't even heard of the use of socks and shoes in her or his or (fuck even the dad doesn't know the sex) lifetime.  
The story in this series is superb. A few episodes focuses on Spike's past with the Red Dragon Syndicate and his rival Vicious, and girlfriend Julia. Each of these episodes leads up the epic conclusion of the series, which to this day is considered one of the best anime endings of all time. There are also episodes that focus on the other supporting casts, such as their backstorys or involvement with major issues related to the plot.  
The soundtrack is also superb (screw you I like using superb) with music that beats the crap out of -- percent of anime today. Just listening to the opening them ""Tank"" reminds me of the good times I had with my ex-wife back in the Jazz age, until she jumped off a bridge when I realized she was stealing money from my bank account. But anyways, if you haven't listened to it or have, you should definantly go buy it, since it's worth evey penny of your useless life. 
The animation is also outstanding, with it's lighting and visual backgrounds, such as downtown environments on different planets struck by the poverty bug. It is made to look more realistic and eye popping than my birthday records. 
Overall I would reccommend this to anyone, a current anime watcher who hasn't seen it, or a newbie into the anime community.

Note. I watched Haibane Renmei as part of a tiny anime watching ""club"" with my real life friends. Someone chooses an anime every month. Everyone watches it and does a review.  May was this. I watched the last - episodes (-----) in one sitting, and found myself getting genuinely angry with how the series was turning out, since I liked episodes --- so much. So, after angrily pacing around my living room stewing about how much the series reminded me of things in my own life, I wrote this.I'm very into stylistic writing for things that are, well, MEANT to be stylistic. I should probably be embarrassed about this. The tone here is meant to be condescending and sound pretentious, but I think overall my feelings are conveyed about this show, despite it being wrapped up in layers of snotty, pretentious style. It's mostly venting. I wonder if anyone else feels this way about this poor show that didn't deserve this. 
Hello, class. I'll be your professor this semester. Please open the syllabus to the first page, and let's begin. 
Where did we come from? Why are we here? What's after this? 
Now that we've opened our syllabuses, let's begin covering some topics for our class. Welcome to Intro to Philosophy ---. 
Haibane Renmei is a raw, dreamlike introspection into the theory of existentialism. The perusal of what makes a person a person. What makes us, well us? How do other people perceive us? Do other people see my values? My morals? My wills? 
Wait. I've heard this before. 
Haibane Renmei is a show based more around evoking feelings, memories, thoughts, familiarity. The Romantic. The Gothic. The juxtaposition of realities and thoughts. 
Wait. I've heard this before. 
Haibane Renmei asks the question: have you ever said something you knew would cut someone directly to the bone, on purpose? Have you ever felt you weren't good enough for your own (heavily skewed, unrealistic) goals? Have you ever been unable to let things go? 
Wait. I've heard this before. 
Haibane Renmei is foundations of philosophy, simmering just beneath the surface. It's dulcet music. It's messy, just like real life. 
You know, I remember the paper you turned in last semester, Yoshitoshi ABe. Plagiarizing is punishable by expulsion, even if it was your own paper. I remember Serial Experiments Lain, you're not going to fool me. 
Haibane Renmei does very little for me. I've already seen Lain. But that doesn't explain all of why I don't care. 
I have to explain a concept first. 
Have you ever judged someone for not having the knowledge you gained yesterday, today? Have you ever lived through something, done something, gained something, learned something, and looked down upon someone who hasn't lived it, hasn't done it, hasn't gained it, hasn't learned it? 
It's a pretty shitty thing to do.  
I do it a lot.  
I'd describe myself as a pretty condescending person though. 
Haibane Renmei does very little for me because while the climax of the story is focussed on the only characters who got more than basic (though sensible) archetypes for their personality, it's something I've already done. 
Reki's struggle with her own inner turmoil is very fiercely human. Rakka's too. 
Perhaps I am too cynical. It meant very little to me to see my own problems from years past played out on screen. Maybe it's because I have done all of these things. Maybe it's because I still feel hurt at things I have done in the past, things I have said, things I have lost, things I can't piece back together- things would cast me in a terrible light in the eyes of people I care about, people I love, people I set on pedestals, people I've lost, people I want to think about me; or maybe I'd even cast myself in a darker light in my own eyes.  
Haibane Renmei mostly evoked feelings of annoyance. 
""Yeah, me too, Reki."" ""Yeah, I've been a dick to people I love too, over something I thought was more important but hindsight is --/-- what a dumb thing to do."" ""Maybe I shouldn't strive to live up to other's standards of me that are incorrect and make me uncomfortable."" ""Maybe I should get a giant magnifying pair of glasses to see past my own fucking nose.""  
Perhaps I'm too cynical for a show like this. Perhaps I am too wise, too knowledgeable, too vastly smart for a show to throw the largest, most heard, asked, scribbled, questioned, pondered, meditated, thought, unanswered questions in philosophy at me and not have me roll my eyes. I've already lived this. I'm judging you. 
I already graduated from this school of thought. This is why I'm the professor of this course. 
Haibane Renmei is a show that focuses on guilt, friendship, loss, and depression. The characters are well-structured archetypes, but does nothing past their archetypes. They are never fleshed out. Characters are presented only to drive the plot around Rakka and Reki.  They are given beautiful, crisp wings and glowing halos because ABe thought it would look cool. This show is style over substance. 
The major points at play are steeped in sensibility and grasp at the edges of real feelings, real personality, but it says nothing about it. Philosophy is only theory, but reality is really here, and really real. Life is messy and raw, but this feels like a -st draft, not something that should be the final product. It does nothing new with its meditation on philosophy, or existentialism, or thoughts about perception of oneself. This show is heavy-handed with what themes it does convey (what is my perception of myself? what is others perceptions of me? what's after this? why am I here?) but not unpleasant.  
The show is wrapped up in its own pretensions. It is very pretty, but it's not worth holding up to the light. 
My pretentious review  of a pretentious show will save you -- episodes. 
But I'm probably being unfair. I've already done this. If you had shown me this when I was younger, dumber, not as critical and harsh, I would have liked it. This show for me is old hat, and very unfairly so. This is an extremely biased review. I didn't like it because ?????. 
Watch Angel Beats! if you want a more fast-paced, dumbed down, but coherent version of this. Watch Lain if you want something that truly has a hairs breadth of its themes regarding self and identity.

I must say I'm a fan of slice-of-life series, since I can appreciate the slow pacing of the show and simply enjoy of atmosphere created by the series. I loved Hidamari Sketch and Aria. I even liked series like Sketchbook and Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, though they was never my favourites. But I cannot seem to enjoy what Tamayura has to offer. 
First of all, the setting never really got to me. I have a bit of interest in photography, but I've never got the least interested while the cast is on the subject. Secondly, the cast is really, really boring. Fu and Kou are the only names I recall. I can only remember the rest of the cast as the whistling girl, the twin-tail who's always on high, and the nondescript ponytail. They do not seem to have any other traits I can remember. 
So in the end, I can hardly remember anything about the series, even though I've only just finished watching it. I could hardly pay attention to what little the series has to offer. I had expected more from Hal Films... 
The art quality is average and the music is forgettable. I feel that the seiyuus, even Kana Asumi, isn't doing a very good job with the characters even though she's more familiar with the genre. 
I really cannot recommend this to anyone since I cannot seem to find any parts of the series interesting enough to talk about.

I have never seen a story across any medium devolve into such drivel. There is no justification for the appalling behavior of any of the characters. It becomes so stupid, it is infuriating to watch. 
There is no explanation to the backstory and mechanics of things, and no eventual payoff whatsoever. My suspension is of disbelief is thoroughly shattered (and then some) past the halfway point, and it just keeps picking up the pace exponentially until the final fuck-you that is the ending.  
It is dreadful in tone and content. If you liked this anime, you were most likely filling in innumerable plot holes and characterization flaws with the manga they wrote at a time before either you or the writers knew how these things were passably written. As a standalone, Devilman Crybaby is nonsense.  
-/--, because that Miko girl had some nice knockers, I guess. Don't bother with this anime.

Like many others, I came to know about this anime through memes. 
I have never been interested in cars, but this show is one hell of a ride. 
I never thought I would enjoy it so much. All the characters are well written, and there is so much thrill and suspense in the show that it reminds you of Death Note and Code Geass.Never did I feel bored once during the span of -- episodes. 
That being said, the highlight remains the soundtrack. There is a reason why it's  memed that much. 
The only drawback is the use of CGI.I can only hope that it gets better with time.

After seeing a lot of good romance animes this year such as Nagi no Asukara, Golden Time, Ao Haru Ride, I thought romance/Slice-of-Life anime this year would be great, that is why I gave a shot at Glasslip, believing that there would be some quality in this work, after all it is the work of Kenji Horikawa producer of Angel Beats, I mean c'mon this must be good! 
... Boy I was wrong... 
After watching each of the -- episodes, I felt more confused than when I started the anime, but let's break it down 
~CONTAIN SPOILERS~ 
- Story - -/-- 
The plot starts when a new transfer student David arrives to the small town where this group of friends are just beginning their summer vacation. Ok it isn't horrible at this point, it pretty much starts like any other cliche anime. So let's begin the reasons why this anime went downhill. 
This anime is all about the development of relationships throughout the summer vacation. 
The main characters David and Touka become 'friends' i think (because i still don't know what they are) and both them have this strange connection regarding these ''future fragments''. I thought the show would spin around this theme but it doesn't and you at least expect the show to explain what these are, well they don't as well. Not only that but you discover somewhat in the anime that even the characters don't know what these fragments are... 
The other - remaining engage in their relationships throughout the anime but at the end ALL relationships seemed not to have change... So... You might ask... What exactly happens during the anime, the answer is nothing. Not only you end confused but the story doesn't actually develop from where it started. 
Not only that but most of the time (especially in the last episodes) you stay disoriented in most conversations along the anime. It only helps you get more lost than you were. 
- Character -  -/-- 
The show itself provides next to no character development or information about the past... I think the most that I learned from the past of character was from Yukinari and that he hurt his knee one day and couldn't run as well as he did... But that is it. So let's the characters: 
Firstly there is Touko, who doesn't do much in the show even though she is supposed to be the main character along with David. She pretty much spends the whole anime thinking what are the future fragments, and in the end she doesn't even understand it... 
Then there is the weirdest character of the whole summer line-up(might have exaggerated a bit) he is the main cause along with Touko to why you can't understand the dialogues, it seems like he has some deep understanding and knowledge by the way he talks, again No. Plus, he is just plain weird... Sleeps in a tent outside his house, i mean c'mon ... 
Now one of the characters that most surprised me during the whole series, and that is Sachi. At first you just see common sick bookworm girl that uses glasses, very common. But then she suddenly turns into the most manipulative character in the series, and in a way that will only get pissed. Not only that it seemed, for me, that she was breaking up with her ''boyfriend'' while making a confession to another character, lol what!?... yeah this is the part that surprised me.    
Then there is Yukinari, which at first seemed a well rounded character, but then as the show passed turned into a boring depressive character after getting rejected, and he pretty much stays like that from mid to end of the show. 
Next up, is Yanagi which was pretty much was simple character...  At first during the show she seemed jealous of Touko because Yukinari had confessed his feelings for her best friend not her. But then tries to act all grown up like doesn't care and it stays like that until the end of the show. 
Lastly, there is Hiro which is by far my favorite character of the show along with some support characters. The reason why he is my favorite is just because he was the most sane person in the group, and that had some pretty interesting interactions with the other characters, such as Sachi when she does something to harm DavidxTouko's  relationship. And that is it. 
- Art/Animation - -/-- 
Even though the anime sucked, I got give some points in the art, nothing that stands out though... It doesn't match up to Nagi no Asukara, another work of P.A. Works but still it wasn't to shabby to complain. Even though, most of the show was slow and focused on the weird dialogues, the art compensated it. 
- Sound - -/-- 
Indisputably the best part of the anime. The OP/ END were nice, along with the OST's throughout the anime, but nothing remarkable as well. 
- Enjoyment - -/-- 
Didn't enjoy the show at all, mostly because the show was pretty horrible. But also because I didn't feel anything throughout the show sadness, laughter (being aside the part with Touko's Sister =D that cracked me up) anything at all... 
- Overall - -/-- 
The show purely sucked a lot. I just can't believe something like this was created by the same producer of Angel Beats! And that P.A. Works responsible for the animation of Nagi no Asukara and Angel Beats! agreed to make this... 
I am astonished that no one looked at the script and the final result of the project and said ''Yeah this sucks ass hard, are we really making this?'' (Sorry for the rudeness but that is pretty much what the show is)

Now don't get me wrong by looking at the mark i gave this anime. On my scale, - is very high, way above average. And Saraiya Goyou really is just that. It is not a masterpiece, or even close to that, but it beats the majority of the anime we get to watch.  
The story is the best part of this anime. It is not linear. Even though it is told in a chronological order with a few flashbacks, you can't discern the series of events till the very end. And even then, when you can remember all of the events, and put them together systematically, the story that appears in front of your eyes is not generic or simple. It involves a lot of completely different and unique characters. And they are unique compared not only with each other but with the whole anime medium. A sissy skilled samurai, a prostitute with a sense of justice and so on. While some characters might seem generic when you first get to know them, they appear to be quite original and well developed later on in the show. Yaichi could be a good example of that. A mysterious and cool chick magnet who is also awesomely skilled in fighting. But later on, we get more development on him and the real truth is revealed. But if we consider character development as a whole, I'd say it's not exemplary. I've seen better and deeper characters, but like anime, it's way above average. 
The art might repel a lot of potential viewers, but I liked it. A lot. First of all, it's very original. I don't think there are any more anime with such art. But if we take a closer look, it's only the characters that are drawn originally. They have goofy eyes an such, but it kind of adds up to the whole atmosphere. However, if you look at the background, and things around the  characters, you will see awesomeness. Detail everywhere, textures, lighting - everything. It was really spectacular. 
Another aspect of this anime that I loved a lot, is it's sound track. It was amazing. It built up such a relaxing mood. And if we add it together with the soothing coloring of the anime, we might just fall asleep watching it. The music itself was not something spectacular. I would not download and listen to like a song. But what makes it good in the anime is the matches with everything else. 
I enjoyed watching Saraiya Goyou. It did not make my brain melt, it let me relax after a hard day and just forget the world around me. But an important thing is that you have to catch every little detail there is to fully understand the story. So a complete relaxation is not an option. You should just turn of your muscles and let your mind do the work. 
To sum up, Saraiya Goyou is a fresh whiff of air among all the crap we get. I wish we could watch more anime like this. But then again, it is not and it won't be popular for quite some time and therefore, we should not be expecting that. That's why people who like such intelligent anime with no fan service, dumb action scenes and generic storylines and characters should not miss any of the good ones like House of the Five Leaves.

Firstly, anal sex is the focal fetish of this animation. Oral is scarce and vaginal aint really featured. 
So the plot goes: a cute innocent girl is sold into sexual slavery to pay off a debt, becomes a plaything and gets strong anal dickings. 
To review this animation with any sort of coherence you need to split it between the first episode and the second episode. 
Now, the first episode is quite average. It features mostly anal sex with a little deviation. It's a little fetishy: Besides anal sex you get things like gaping anal sphincters and forcibly inserting eggs down the gas pipe. But relative to episode two, it isn't that hardcore. 
The artwork is comptently drawn, the animation is consistent and its overall a solid episode. Weren't many standout qualities, but it wasn't terrible. 
Then there's episode two. 
I don't know what happened in production between the first and second episode but here's a guess. 
The original director was replaced with a Teruaki Murakami wannabe, who proceeded to try and emulate Murakami's style with comically bad results. 
In other words it veers steeply into the ""hardcore"" hentai genre, where pacing is increased twofold, scenes are pretty graphic 
There are literal bucketloads of seminal fluids spewing as jets from orifices. 
They even do that motion sickness inducing move where they loop an animation and zoom/pan cross the scene. 
They really put an emphasis on animating faces in such a way that they do not resemble human faces even remotely. 
What they were going for was Ahegao faces but what they achieved was these mushed faces contorted beyond recognition. I can't think of a suitable similie for how they animated these faces. 
Overall the animation was really sketchy. For example There's scene's where the anal sphincter is spasming open and closed and they didn't bother to draw inbetween frames so it was just alternated between open and closed. 
The drawn bodies anatomy is so messed up I don't even know where to begin. 
I suppose one of the redeeming qualities about a hentai like this is that they at least vary more in the style of shot drawn (ie the perspective from which they're drawn), even if it doesnt turn out particularly well. 
They also decided to include slight anal prolapse as a feature in this episode. What this means is the anal innards become outards before retracting back into the depths of the rectum. In my opinion this is not a feature of the human anatomy that really needs to be transposed into -D animation. Doesn't do much for me. 
The style of the show really has no continuity at all in style between the first and second episode. There wasn't even a plot device which turned the girls into jello garbling fish monsters, it was just done without explanation and all attempts at narrative are forgone almost completely. 
It's worth seeing if you want to watch a particularly ridiculous hentai. You might get a laugh out of it, or fap to it. I fapped to it. 
On a side note: pouring bottles of wine into someones rectum is really fucking dangerous please do not imitate this.

The Fate franchise being one of my favorites;Fate Extra LE was an anime I was excited to see ,but I should have learned my lesson from getting hype for Apocrypha in ---- and not jump on the hypetrain. I felt like my reasons were justified for LE though as it was being animated by Shaft, one of my favorite studios and also had Nasu himself writing the script. Before I get into my reasons for not liking Extra LE, I will say that I never played the game Fate Extra or CCC, I`ve only played Extella so my understanding of the anime is not as good as someone who has played the game it`s based on. 
One of the main reasons I disliked LE is the format. Everyone is probably familiar with the format of the Holy Grail War  but LE has a strange take on it. Hakuno and Nero and sometimes Rin would get to a floor, fight the master that controls the floor than advance. If you ever read Tower of God it is kind of like Baam and co climbing the tower floors. In Tower though each floor is given enough chapters to form a well-paced story; in LE each floor was over in - episodes and you could forget about one floor as soon as they move on to the next.  
Even if it was the usual Grail War it wouldn`t have helped. The battles were all lackluster. Fights are a vital part of a Fate anime and I wasn`t expecting the fights to be as good as Zero and UBW but better than what we got from this. All the fights felt too short and none of them had that epic feel. Even Apocrypha for all its flaws had fights that felt epic. The biggest kick in the balls was Nero unleashing her Noble Phantasm. It lasted all of -- seconds and the whole sequence was just her dashing over with a big slash. The main servants Noble Phantasm deserves more than this. The first time I saw Artoria use Excalibur in Zero was one of the most exciting parts of Zero; in LE Neros NP was just another forgettable moment. 
The story was the biggest problem. It was hard for me to summon any interest at times. Hakunos whole thing of trying to recall who he is and what his purpose is felt cliché. It was hard to care about the enemy masters and servants when you knew they would get beaten in - episodes. They felt like villain of the day type of characters to me, so why should I care? The only good part was the designs of some of the floors like the city floor and the Madoka Magica themed floor. 
The characters also lacked  depth. Nero as the main servant should have good character interaction with Hakuno but most of their dialogue involved Hakuno being depressed and Nero encouraging him. Hakuno would have random moments of anger and put his serious face on and ramble about how much hate he has like Sasuke used to do. The most memorable of Nero and Hakunos scenes were the fanservice ones. I make no secret of liking ecchi/hentai as my list will show but from this anime I wanted interesting conversations like the ones Kirei and Gilgamesh had in Zero; instead we get an emo kid needing encouragement every step of the way. 
The only things I really liked about LE was the animation and opening song. A boring story and bad use of characters really lowered the enjoyment of watching this every week. There`s supposed to be a continuation of this but I have no hope for it getting better. If you are new to Fate do not start with this shitshow under any means and even if you have watched Zero/UBW/---- Fate I would not recommend wasting time on this.

I haven't read the original --volume manga that this anime adapts but it certainly feels like a very crammed adaptation that stretched production values. It's certainly ambitious and challenging and I applaud Netflix for taking a risk like this. 
However, this series feels like a long shonen manga that's been crammed into -- episodes (with the violence and sex turned up to --). We don't spend long enough with the characters to really empathize with their character moments, the plot advances so quickly that all the subtlety and consistent theming is lost, things just seem to happen on a whim so our good guys have something to do. The story/characters would have been better served with a ---episode season. As it is, these ---episodes feel more like a ""best of"" summary of Devilman rather than an actual story. 
That being said, the first episode is worth watching for its challenging and beautiful art. Everyone should get to know this series and its director, Yuasa Masaaki, but not everyone needs to see this series.

As of the writing of this review, only the Uprising Arc has been shown. I have read the manga, and to be honest this arc was my least favorite, since it was very stretched out and kinda boring. But to my surprise, the anime is the exact opposite! WIT Studio has done an incredible job at translating this slow-paced arc into an amazing, interesting and incredible anime. 
Story (-): Even though they sped up this arc, the beginning was still a bit slow. But many great anime suffer from the same problem, so you should never judge an entire anime just on the first few episodes. The quality of the story became better and better after each episode, and it probably won't stop going into the next arc this season. 
Art (-): Beautiful art, just as in the previous seasons. The CGI used in this season is actually a lot better than in the previous one (that colossal problem was horrible). But in this season it's quite alright. 
Sound (-): Man, it has been said a lot, but Hiroyuki Sawano is like the Hans Zimmer of anime. Every single anime he worked on has a soundtrack beyond amazing.  
Although most people don't like the opening and say 'the ending and opening should be switched', I actually really like the opening. But yes, the ending is way better, but the opening is great too, don't be so butthurt. 
Character (-): Levi and Mikasa are just as bad-ass as ever and still remain to be my favorite characters. Although now, we're introduced to Kenny the Ripper, someone who can compete with them on my favorite character list. I don't know why, but I'm just a sucker for bad-ass killing machines.  
And I guess Eren and the rest are there too... 
Enjoyment (--): Even though the beginning was a bit slow, this arc is definetaly one of my favorties. From such a slow and boring manga arc to this incredible anime arc. Just goes to show how well WIT Studio is handling this series.  
Overall (--): There is not much to complain about this season. I enjoyed it all the way up until now and I will continue to enjoy it for the remaining episodes. I honestly can't wait to see the next arc animated!!

So my uncle has bugged me for such a long time to watch soul eater. So a couple months ago I finally decided to read the manga. I absolutely loved the manga! Definitely within my top ten. After I finished up with reading it, I started watching it the other day. I am VERY impressed on how close it is with the manga. I do notice some changes, but they are tiny. I would have to say this is the closest I have ever seen an anime to the original manga. (Although while looking for the author's name I found that the plots will diverge a little bit.) :( Like I mentioned earlier, in my top ten, so I am giving Soul Eater a -.- out of -. 
[Story:-.-] 
Pretty generic at times, and a tad predictable every so often, and yet they manage to make a great story. Plenty of conflicts that will stir your emotions. One of the biggest theme in this anime is friendship, so its a very heart warming manga most the time. This is a Shonen, so there is action to keep you awake. (I watch a lot of my anime at night.) 
[Art:-.-] 
I wish my art style looked like that. O.o Well mostly. I do want to be original I suppose. (Sorry off topic.) Anyways, great art. All of the character designs are very well thought out. The sun, moon, and clouds are very unique. One of my favorite parts of the whole anime. (I giggle every time I see the sun or moon.) xD 
[Ideology:-.-] 
There is a very unique system of meisters and weapons. (Bleach is kinda similar... But to try to compare them would be a long stretch.)  The concept of meisters and weapons is really fun and singular. (One person would be the meister and use the weapon, the other person would transform into a weapon to be used. The stronger their souls are connected the stronger they are in battle. People with bigger souls are more powerful. ect...)

Before we get into the core of the review, let me say that Re:zero surprise me a lot, my first mindset when i'm interested in watching this anime is that this anime is going to be a good but cheesy romance fantasy anime with the main plot center around the relationship between all the female lead with the main protagonist. While there's some elements about that, the main overall plot is deeper than that and there's surprisingly a lot of epic battle in it. Soo, is it live up to the hype ?? I will tell you all about it. 
The plot is to be honest, kinda hit and miss, the plot lines consist of something like this, the main character found a mystery or a problem that he has to solve, he failed a couple of times to solve it, and after --- episodes of trying to piece together a solution, by some mysterious power known as the power of determination, friendship, and a lot.. a lot.. of luck, he managed to solves it. Nearly all the plot lines can be solved this way, while the first time he found a mystery or a problem part is really great and thrilling, you will question youself whats up with  mystery, why does the problem keep happening and stuff like that, when he finally able to solve it you will think, ""Thats it? All this build up for that?"". While this ""luck"" could happen once or twice in an anime plot but when the situation when from ""Ohh my god !! Everyone is dead ! Ohh nooo !!!"" to ""Well, we just solve this without anyone dying, great !"" in an episode, its really discouraging in the end. They even did this in the ending, it makes all those build up seems wasted.  
The main problem from this anime is that there's a lot of plot holes, from the unexplained villain motive that the anime seems to have forgotten about it after -- episodes or so to some sinister smile to what it seems to be a ""good guy"" It is unbelievable. While i do get it that this anime is from Light novel that wasn't finished at the time when this anime is released, but the way they tease it is just annoying. Don't give away too many small plotholes if you cannot answer it in the end. In the end of this anime while i get the answer of some of the main mystery, there still more than -- plotholes that didn't get answered. 
Like i said before, the solution to the problem in the ending is one of the smoothess problem solving so far in this anime, it really makes all that effort to get to that point useless. While i dislike the problem solving, the romance scene ending is golden, to be frank all the romance scene is golden in this anime, its sweet, beautiful, and charming, all of that is thanks to the great character development. 
What makes this anime surprisingly stand out from the other is the character development, nearly all the main characters has their own personality and its all beautifully told either from the interaction with the main protagonist or from stories told through flashback, they all has their own goal, motive, and personalites that makes them unique and the personality is not just ""She is evil or she is a tsundere."" There isn't a truly nice person in this anime and the main protagonist need to prove that he is worthy of someone respect and kindness. It is a shame that the main protagonist character development is hit and miss, on some scene he is really realistic, so realistic that the anime give about - episodes with him stressed out because of his power, but again on the other hand he is suddenly brave because the situation demanded to, this inconsistency its what makes me cannot like the main protagonist completely. 
The romance is one of the best, nearly all the female lead has a good reason to like the main protagonist and the anime explain it well why they like him, even the conflict is explain well in the end. This anime also has one of the greatest confession scene in the anime that i have ever watched. When i watch the confession scene, its soo beautiful and cute that i want to punch a wall, its that good. 
The overall action scene is quite decent, some of it is really epic and cool, like the first battle scene that is really awesome, not the best out there but good enough to make my jaw drop. While the other action scene is decent enough but not that great and epic, its just either ended to quickly or not really great because of one sides outskilled the other. Overall, im quite happy with the action scene. The visual for it is really satisfying to watched also, because of how they didn't afraid of using blood to spice up the battle, its really adds up to the action scene. 
While the background art and character design is okay, the music is really great, its really adds up to the whole mood, like when the main protagonist is facing danger or when the romance scene happened, its really help in building up the mood, its successfully guided the audience towards a certain mood and that is the point of the background music. 
Soo, is it good ?? I must say yes, its not a masterpiece by any stretch of your imagination. But it is enjoyable enough to satisfied your time. Watch for the character development, the romance and the action scene and you will not be disappointed.

As there are no reviews on this I thought I'd leave my own. 
Before watching these I thought ""How bad could it be, it's Code Geass right?"". However, I'm pretty sure I could draw art with my dick that is better than this and the fact that there are no voices and a lack of any good sound effects just makes it so much worse. 
I was thinking of giving it a -/-- because of how messed up Rolo looks but to be honest that didn't make me enjoy it any more. 
Therefore, -/--. Sorry Code Geass, just don't do this s*** again...

Oh, a recap of the entire Goblin Slayer. Thank Jesus, I completely forgot that one thing that ever happens in it. You know that thing? The one that is literally THE NAME of this damn series? Yeah, thanks for reminding me. Know that meme about the Norwegian murderer? ""Why am I here again? Oh yeah, the murders."" ""What was Goblin Slayer all about again? Oh yeah, he slays them, fucking right."" 
Here's the recap: 
Naked girls. Cow tits. Slaying a goblin. Slaying ---- more goblins. Edgy intensifies. Rape and people die. ""Typical mistake for amateurs.""  
Girl: fuck he is amazing  
Guy: fuck he is amazing 
Videogamedunkey: fuck he is amazing 
Me *in very deep thoughts and utterly focused on the recap* : If I add a D in goblin, it becomes GoBlind.  
i.e. It's boring.  
That's pretty much everything. The main difference is how it's just -- times shorter and worse than the original. I don't think any in-depth analysis is required to explain how good of an idea -- = - is, so I will give this a -/-- just to not follow this math. 
*This review is a repost, removed originally because of my earlier --/-- score was ""in contradiction"" with the review itself, should be fine now*

I watched this show when it was simulcasted and have been too busy with other things than to be writing a review for this.  I would like to state this show is pretty much a waste of time to watch. if you have seen a trailer it might look pretty animation wise but does not cover the hot mess this show is.  
Story -/-- 
The first two episode where ok story wise but what followed those two episode where the following problems. The only story the viewer are interested in after watching the first two episodes is the story of Aoto. However they decided to mike in a load of subplots and introduce a load of characters over the course of the ten episodes that follow. Other problems include pacing that was extremely fast and loads of flashbacks that don't help the viewer understand the characters better but only make things more confusing.   
Art -/--  
the only plus with this series is its art style. In the first few episode its ok however in other episodes some of the art is lacking. Character designs are also the only plus with the series however looking cool didn't make the characters any more interesting.   
Sound -/--  
some of the sound effects used seemed highly repetitive while the opening being the only decent song in the ost.  
Character -/-- 
This series had a lot of characters with a lot being introduced  especially in the middle episodes. It felt like the plot was just introducing characters in general. The three mcs who take most of the screentime are introduced in the first episode as confident heroes who are going to battle a lot of enemies while in a majority of the series they just stand around and watch other characters just introduced fight. The bad guys like the good guys are introduced in large numbers and not seen again till the end except for the villain loki.  
Enjoyment -/-- 
When I finished the show I was happy It was done in hope of something better will take its slot next season.

(Sorry if this is kind of a lame review) 
This anime caught my eye for two reasons: watching the first episode was visually pleasing and one of my favorite voice actors was one of the main characters. I guess that was part of the reason I tried super hard to like this one (and believe me, I REALLY wanted to like this anime). Honestly I wish I could explain what this anime was about but after a while, I really didn't know. 
Story: 
The story, as stated before, was personally very hard to grasp. I understood that it was (or at least it seemed) set in the future and technology was extremely advanced and there was this ""magic"" that they used (nothing like the magic in Harry Potter). In the school that the protagonist attends, it's all about magic and you're either really good at it and be enrolled as a Bloom, or you're not so good and end up being enrolled as a Weed (and those who were Weeds were frowned upon and sometimes bullied by the Blooms). It's basically a day in a life anime where you see the main character, Tatsuya and his little sister Miyuki enroll in this school which is the main setting. Also Miyuki has romantic feelings for her brother which I found pretty weird because she makes it kind of obvious but it's kind of unclear whether or not Tatsuya knows and goes along with it or really is oblivious about his sisters feelings. The entire story (whatever it was supposed to be) just really didn't stick with me which is why I ultimately ended up dropping it after the --th episode. Anyways the entire story I gave a -/-- 
Art 
I thought the art was VERY VERY VERYYY good, especially when they were performing magic. I always got excited when they would start using it, even if it was for a class, because everything was just fantastic! There really were no flaws about this, so I gave it a --/--. 
Sound: 
The soundtrack was pretty good, and got very intense around the times Tatsuya was performing his magic against someone else (so fighting, dont know why I just didnt say that before). I gave it a -/--. 
Character: 
The character development............ sucked. In fact, there really was none, it was that poorly done. I know I've only watched -- episodes a while ago but the one thing that stuck with me was that there was no development. Plus I really don't know why Tatsuya was placed as a Weed when he was EXTREMELY good at magic. I honestly have no clue if they ended up getting to that or if I missed something in the episodes that I've watched but that part really got me thinking if A: he was being modest or B: that school had super high standards but even if that was the case, he was better than a lot of the other students. Plus he kicked major ass while fighting. From the episodes I've watched, the younger sister Miyuki really didn't do any magic but when she did, I'll admit, it was pretty damn cool. She was practically a futuristic Elsa and in fact, her magic kind of got out of control when in an emotional state, like Elsa. She's pretty, kind although a bit odd in having romantic feelings for her brother. The supporting characters were nice people and all and filled the comedy relief factor but other than that, there really was no development for them at all. I gave this a -/--. 
Enjoyment: 
As I said before, after a while the show kinda just got... lame. Boring even. The beginning was pretty interesting and it did get me hooked for as long as it did but after about the --th or --th episode, I was always questioning whether or not I should give this anime the benefit of doubt and hope it would get better or if I should just drop it. Obviously I ended up dropping it after a while. What I really enjoyed about this anime was the magic and I enjoyed watching Tatsuya fight a bunch of jerks that thought they were ""the shit"" when they looked weak and pathetic fighting against Tatsuya. I gave this a -/--. 
Overall: 
Overall I gave it a -/--, and I truly wish I could give it a higher score but I just didn't like it. It had so much potential, especially given the amount of episodes it has out but in the end I was very disappointed.

I'm going to preface this review by saying that I've read the web novel and the manhua for Battle Through the Heavens, and both are quite excellent and are among my favorite xianxia series. This anime adaptation however, is quite horrific: not only is the editing incredibly messy, with a lot of abrupt cuts that interrupt the flow, but the characters act nothing like their source material counterparts and entire scenes progress in a way that is hackneyed and incomprehensible. 
Do yourself a favor and pick up the webnovel for the plot points that the -st season covers, and start watching from the ONA special. Because of the terrible feedback from Chinese audiences, Tencent switched animation studios for the ONA special and season -, which are vastly improved and are actually quite good.

OH, MY GOODNESS, THIS SEASON WAS SO GOOD-- WHY COULDN'T THE REST OF THE SERIES BE LIKE THIS?? NOW I'M LEFT WANTING MORE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GET GREAT UNTIL NOW! Seriously, though, this was everything I wanted out of this anime. Let me try and explain through my excitement.  
The story, okay? There... was one. I don't know how else to tell you, but there was an actual story with this season. No segmented episodes, no pointless plot lines, no lack of character development. Like... there was story to tell throughout this season that I just loved. I was also hoping that I'd finally get to see some serious things happening that weren't undermined by the constant humor, and guess what? I GOT IT. Guys, I'm so happy. Thankfully, this season did actually bring up some serious topics, which were handled really nicely. Also, between the characters as well, there were both negative and positive developments that we got to see without it, again, being ruined by misplaced humor. So, yes, the story has finally come to fruition. Two seasons of nothing lead to everything happening here, and ya know what? It was awesome. 
SPEAKING of the characters, just YES. I felt like their quirks actually MEANT something, and they didn't overpower their personalities at all. Besides that though, they *developed.* There was actual, visible progress for many of the characters this season. They had struggles, they questioned themselves, they found happiness, they grew up. I couldn't have asked for anything more.  
It still has the same, lovable charm it's always had. It's extremely funny, the characters are entertaining to watch, and the environment always allows for more content. But this season had all that and *substance* to boot. I don't know why you'd be here if you haven't already seen the rest of the series, but if you want to know if it's worth watching to get here, it is. Getting involved and invested with this series and its characters was so much fun. I'm excited to finish it out because it's been a wonderful anime to watch. See you at the next!

It's been a long time since I've seen a Slice of Life done well. I'm not sure what it is about Hanasaku Iroha, but it is one of the calmest anime I have seen in a long while. There's something about the series that is just very relaxing. 
The story essentially revolves around Ohana, a young teenage girl, and her experiences as she works as a waitress in an inn. As the show progresses, you are able to see the blooming relationships that develop as she begins to understand herself and the people around her. The show focuses on the challenges of being a teenage girl and Ohana's inner resolve to 'fest' it up no matter the situation. While there is romance, it is extremely slow paced. It will pop in from time to time to apply a dose of necessary drama to keep the audience interested in what will happen next and how it will affect each character. For a -- episode series, I was skeptical at first of how they could achieve a balance between the amount of entertaining material and filling such a large amount of time. Much to my delight PA works really did manage to balance these two quite well.  
The Art/Animation was good. The first opening had some choppy parts in the animation, but the animation throughout the series flowed smoothly and there's nothing to complain about here. I also found the openings and endings to be quite nice; fitting, if you will, for the show. One aspect that I felt was unnecessary here was the fan service. While it's not over the top ecchi, there are scenes that just felt out of place considering this is a slice of life drama. I'm kind of split between whether or not to criticize or praise this because on one hand the risque factor was toned down quite a lot, but on the other hand it didn't help further the show's enjoyment and wasn't necessary.  
Now going back to the bit about Hanasaku Iroha being -- episodes. The -- episodes really did justice to each of the characters. Each character's strengths, weaknesses, and quirks felt really defined. The pacing of the show, besides the romance, was solid and had a laid back flow. Ohana is very strong-willed and has a natural helping, outgoing personality. Minko is a tsundere that gets overly jealous and is quick to jump to conclusions. Nako is the quiet girl who's pretty much perfect yet is somehow very timid and lacks charisma. As the series progresses, each character becomes more and more likeable; you really get to see that they are all good people with good intentions.  
Overall, a solid, relaxing watch. If you have the time, and enjoy the Slice of Life genre, perhaps you might consider booking a reservation at Kissuiso to see what it has to offer.

First of all I want to point out that I played the video games before see the film. 
This adaptation is very poor for me. The background of persona is interesting and the universe very powerfull in the game but on the screen one feels absolutely nothing. The animation is pathetic with many fixed-time moments and one feels too much the fact that the story is taken from the video game without adapting to the format. For example scenes in the velvet room or the calendar indicating which day is. 
To this is added an OST of elevator which totally prevented me from entering the film. 
Very disappointed

Watching the antics of high school characters in anime has rarely been as enjoyable as it has been while watching Azumanga Daioh. The ---- anime, directed by Hiroshi Nishikori, wasn’t quite a side-splitter from start to finish but it was a thoroughly entertaining experience. It seems so many comedy shows made in the years since have failed to take lessons from this series in how to create fun yet grounded characters, snappy jokes and fun scenarios. Romping around with boundless charm to the tune of a lovely soundtrack and bringing to the table a super-likeable cast, Azumanga Daioh is certain to bring out a smile in the sourest person at some point. 
Based on the four-panel (or --koma) comic by Kiyohiko Azuma, Azumanga Daioh follows a group of girls through their high school years. The show has virtually no complications to speak of and instead follows the group in their daily lives, only rarely jumping into surreal or outlandish territory. Everyone is bound to find one member of Azumanga Daioh’s eclectic cast funny. Osaka will be a hit-or-miss character for some thanks to her slow-witted nature. Some of the things that come out of her mouth are absolutely hilarious while others are just plain weird. There always remains a certain charm to her stupidity. I think typical genki character Tomo steals the show, with her wild verbal and physical antics often causing the rest of the cast plenty of grief. Her long-time bespectacled friend Yomi is probably the most normal of the bunch, someone often left to question how she’s been able to put up with Tomo for such a period of time. Pigtailed Chiyo is the ten-year-old prodigy who is the smart character but at the same time a punching bag for the show’s many visual gags. Sakaki is tall, quiet and mysterious, hiding her softer side from her classmates while keeping a cool air about her. Kagura is a tad dense, much like Tomo and Osaka, but with the athletic ability to make up for it. Everyone in this main cast brings something different to the table and because of that there’s variety in the jokes. There’s a little something for everyone in their delivery as well, whether it be some exceptionally well-timed jokes in the dialogue or a raft of great visual gags. Do all of them hit the mark? Definitely not, but the strike rate is high – more so as the series progresses.  
Azumanga Daioh takes its sweet time building up its characters and bringing out their personality. The opening third or so of Azumanga Daioh feels a little laborious. There’s a sense of déjà vu with the jokes and it becomes a bit of a patience tester. On the other hand, this build up makes the later episodes somewhat of a payoff. The jokes work not just because they’re funnier and get some variation (they do increase in quality, in my opinion), but because you’re accustomed to the way the characters all react with each other. What may have once felt random, loud or annoying is now something that brings out a smile. The shenanigans of homeroom teachers Yukari and Nyamo are more amusing, Yomi and Tomo’s bickering becomes endearing and Osaka’s outrageous dialogue and decision making gets better and better. They’re a whacky bunch who thrive, from a comical point of view, when we get to know them a bit better. The exaggerated expressions from JC Staff still hold up well even -- years down the track. The light hearted soundtrack is a perfect suit for the show and the main theme (Shin Gakki) will be stuck in your head for a while. The soundtrack has an ambling quality to it that makes you feel like you’re taking a Sunday morning stroll. Everything about the presentation is calming. 
You can’t deny Azumanga Daioh is an anime with a tonne of heart. It covers all the aspects of your standard high school setting, from academics to athletics, while making it relatable and funny at the same time. When something finishes and it can that little sense of emptiness then you know it must have done something right. This managed to do just that, which I never would have believed if you told me at the start that that’s how it would feel. Even though I could only manage a few episodes at a time initially, by the time all -- had flown by I was left wanting more. If you can endure that slow start, then it will eventually deliver you a colourful cast of characters you’ll come to love. Azumanga Daioh comes highly recommended to lovers of all types of comedy.

Before watching this show, I'd recommend you Wiki-up on the term known as ""Stockholm syndrome"". It will help you understand the ultimate wrong aspect of this anime far better, but, unfortunately, it still won't ease the fact that this anime is completely and utterly average.  
The story is really simple and there isn't much to it: the girl joins high school, wants to make friends, lies to them about having a boyfriend, turns out that her made-up boyfriend goes to same school with her and is quite popular, he for some reason agrees to go along with her charade and then their adventures begin. I can't say much for the story because there isn't any really. As a mainly character-driven series, the story is put-off into the sidelines and has trouble pacing itself over the episodes. At times, the episodes skip months worth of content they could show, and, for some reason, literally nothing seemed to have changed. I won't detail it out because it might be a spoiler, but you'll understand, trust me. The reason I gave the story such a low score is that even what's there isn't that good. It's predictable and filled with cliches and doesn't really work as a whole on any level.  
Production of the show is its strongest part, alongside the comedy, and is quite eye-catchy. Especially for girl viewers. Even though there are some cute girls, most of them are not really THAT cute, while most of the guys that are important are made out to be quite hot - hence, extremely impossible to relate to just off the basis of the art. Animation hinges on the simplicity of movement and not much else and the series as a whole doesn't really have any heavy scenes when it comes to either art or sound. Speaking of sound, I had a really hard time hearing any music during this anime. For some reason, nothing stuck out and for the most part I didn't even bother looking for it. Voice actors did their jobs decently, but nothing really spectacular there either. 
Now, I expect you have looked up what I asked you to, so I can continue with my depiction of the characters in this show. We have Erika, our main girl, who desperately wants to fit in into high school and lies through her teeth to do so. I can relate to that and, probably, most people who've gone through high school can. What differs us, normal humans, from her is simply how far she's willing to push her lie. It goes bounds and leaps beyond what any sane human, who isn't riddle with any mental illness, would do. While the show puts it all on ""extreme masochism"", it's not. It can't be. You can't give such a vague attribute to your character and expect all her actions to make sense. Regardless of what Sato did to her, she came running back. Regardless of how much he'd hurt her, she came running back. It's not masochism - not even a form of it. It can be only explained as a complete and utter mental illness and, to be honest, show should have been about her going to the shrink and fixing it. Aside from that trait, she's not that interesting to watch. She's kind of likable, I guess,  and is shown to be a pathological liar although I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this story really shouldn't attribute any mental illnesses to his/hers characters ever again because they have no basic idea what they are. 
Next up we have Sata, extreme version of male-tsundere. I'm going to say it upfront: nobody will ever relate to this character. And if you do, you are a horrible human being and you should know it. He lacks any likable traits, and I'd be fine with that if those unlikable traits were realistic. He's also showcased as sadist, but, again, I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this doesn't understand what that means. He often says that he doesn't do it because he likes to, but still does it, which kind of contradicts the entire premise of the sadist. Instead, --% of the things he says are intended to hurt the other party, and not in a sarcastic and funny way. Calling someone a dog over and over and over again, shunning the other people's emotions, dragging them along, doing things that go far beyond simple bullying - that's the kind of character Sata is.  
[MINOR SPOILER] 
There's a certain scene midway through the anime where Erika and Sata are sitting alone in a coffee shop and she asks him what he thinks of her. He then proceeds to tell her how much he likes her and turns it over by the end. Her reaction is okay, I guess, but what's the point of this is that it really showcased just how shallow, uninteresting and borderline insane character Sata is. 
[/MINOR SPOILER END] 
This goes for the majority of the characters: all of them (aside from - or - maybe) seem to be suffering from some sort of a pathological illness, or they're just really, really, really stupid. I won't describe any more because they aren't really worth the page.  
Did I enjoy the anime? Relatively, to be honest, hence this high of a score for all the bashing. Humor, for the most part, was well done and the show did make me laugh out loud a couple of times, but that was about it. Romance is shallow, insane and simply unrealistic, and the 'drama' moments are worth less than those of Clannad.  
All in all, unless you just want to fill your list with rom-coms, I'd stay away from this. Especially if you're looking for likable and relate-able characters.

This show could have been great, and maybe it will be for you girls out there. I'm a guy that often enjoys Shoujo/Josei, but this one, I just can't even. It would have been great, but Irie is just such a piece of s***. Like he is literally worse than Hitler. Well, maybe not Hitler, but he's at least worse than Stalin. You'll keep on telling yourself as you watching, ""Oh, this will be the episode when he stops being an a**hole."" Nope. It never happens. And she's just so blindly loyal to him! Like get a grip girl and kick him to the curb! nope. This anime isn't disappointing, its unsettling. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I totally expected Irie to like see the error of his ways. Nope. And the worst part is that the show totally teases you, like an episode will end on a good note so that you actually expect Irie to be a good decent human being in the next episode. Nope. Sorry-not-sorry. Whats most unsettling is all the praise this show gets. Do girls really like guys like Irie? He's the worst! If you are a guy, at least, please do not watch this, unless you wish to be deeply disturbed.

Note: While i have watched the parent anime series, this review does not assume viewers have previous familiarity with the Trigun anime series, and will base scores as if the movie is fully standalone. However, I will make note when familiarity does affects scores. 
Trigun: Badlands Rumble (BLR henceforth) is an excellent space western that distills the best of the Trigun anime series into --- minutes of exhilarating action and quirky comedy. Despite being intended for fans, even newcomers unfamiliar with Trigun will find the movie immensely entertaining, while fans will find the movie nearly perfect. 
Story: - (for newcomers, - for fans) 
+classic ""Western"" storyline 
+lighthearted, fun tone 
+tightly written story with funny dialogue and no filler 
+captures the best parts of Trigun yet requires no familiarity with the series 
-some parts of the storyline and characters may leave questions if unfamiliar with Trigun 
-unnecessary deus ex machina 
-serious tone of a moourning scene is out of place  
Trigun: BLR takes a classic storyline of the Western genre- betrayal by a posse and getting revenge- and stirs in some of that lawlessness filled with bounty hunters, robberies, and hardscrabble life on a desert frontier, and sets it in a quasi-space western world where colt .--s sit alongside massive hovering sand ships and aging futuristic technology. There are no plot twists in BLR-nothing unpredictable at least- but that's not an issue, because a well-written classic doesn't need extra frills. 
The overall tone of BLR is playful and lighthearted, which complements the uncomplicated storyline. However, there is one mourning scene in the movie which seems a little out of place as an attempt to be serious in an otherwise unserious story. 
The story is tightly written- essentially an extended standalone episode of the series-and benefits by eschewing any overarching plot elements from the series mythology, opting instead to just make the best no-nonsense action-comedy it can. The writing, especially the repartee, is far and above that of the series', and elicited more chuckles from me in the first half-hour than in the first half of the anime series.  
However, a deus ex machina that happens in the final minutes of the climax seem needless, and more of a ridiculous way to reveal the true history between two characters. Fortunately, it can be brushed aside as an afterthought without changing any of the main plot points.  
While the movie does not need familiarity with the series to be fun, those who are versed in the series' characters' stories and backgrounds will be able to make the best out of it, as certain plot points-such as why exactly protagonist Vash doesn't appear to have aged in -- years, or why he refuses to kill- simply aren't explained and assume the viewer already knows. 
Art: - 
+clean fluid animation conveys the action well 
+excellent backgrounds 
+color palette for weather and landscapes done excellently  
+distinctive characters 
+over-the-top character designs perfectly convey a lighthearted, somewhat zany feel 
The increased budget and advances in animation, compared with the anime series, are clear in the quality of the backgrounds and excellent, fluid animation, as well as the incredible character designs of the main and supporting characters. As befitting the lighthearted ""romp"" tone of the movie, characters are charmingly exaggerated with huge guns and ridiculous accessories-the movie doesn't take things too seriously, and neither should the viewer. All the major characters are extremely distinctive and instantly recognizable, including two minor characters who make recurring appearances as comedic relief. 
Fans of the animated series will especially notice how much improved, albeit subtly, the insurance girls' designs are. 
Sound:-- 
+incredible soundtrack perfectly captures the feel of a Western 
+soundtrack sets the tone of scenes perfectly 
+great voice-acting for the English Dub 
- fans may dislike English voice actor changes 
Note: this is a review of the English Dub 
Unexpectedly enough, what makes BLR one of the best space westerns out there is its incredible soundtrack, which features excellent guitar music in the flamenco, folk, and country traditions. The soundtrack perfectly sets the tone for scenes, setting the stage for a heart-pounding and tense classic western showdown or a swagger-filled and uber-cool reveal of a character. Fans of the anime will especially appreciate the incredible difference that a quality non-repetitive soundtrack makes.     
The voice acting for BLR is very good, with special commendation given to the voice actor for the character of Amelia, who does a great job of alternating between cold and serious and exasperated and peeved. A potential quibble for fans of the series is that the voice actors for certain characters, most notably Nicholas Wormwood, are different from that of the series. In the case of Wormwood, I felt the change was detrimental to his overall grizzled tough image, whereas i preferred the new voice actor of Meryl Stryfe. 
Character: - (-- for fans) 
+exceptionally cool, likable characters 
+the characters are perfect representations of their anime counterparts 
-newcomers to Trigun may find the protagonist too unconventional 
-main character motivations are not explained to those unfamiliar with the series. 
Given that this is simply a movie and not a series, there is almost zero character development or depth in BLR, but that's fine, because part of the fun of the movie is seeing one-dimensional ""badass"" archetypes duke it out. The unrepentant thief bent on revenge Gasback is appropriately intimidating, while the enigmatic red-headed bounty hunter Amelia is the epitome of sexy mysterious, and deadly, fortunately without being sexed-up.   
The movie even actually manages to make cross-bearing gunman priest Nicholas D Wormwood even cooler, a feat I thought  impossible. 
The main protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is the exact same as his anime counterpart, which is fine for fans but possibly off setting for newcomers. His goofy peace loving persona and his confident, skilled gunfighting persona are individually very appealing, but are also somewhat unconventional in combination, making for an unconventional hero that newcomers may need getting used to. 
Viewers have no need to know about the tragic backstories of the protagonists for this film, and BLR does well without that. Characters are well-defined enough to be reliably predictable even for those viewers unfamiliar with the series. However, those viewers will also scratch their heads when trying to understand why Vash knows the two insurance girls, why Nicholas Wormwood is such good friend with Vash, and probably more significantly, why exactly Vash the Stampede is such a feared and troublesome name. 
Fortunately, these points are important only for understanding the mythology of the parent series, and aren't necessary for enjoying something as uncomplicated as this movie. 
Enjoyment: - (-- for fans) 
I did not expect to enjoy BLR as much as i did, given my disappointment with  the anime from which it grew out of. But when i watched the movie, I found that it took the parts i liked best from the series, improved upon the writing, and added an amazing soundtrack to create a near-perfect Space Western. 
Magically enough, this is also a film that can stand confidently on its own and still appeal to newcomers independent from the main storyline and mythology of the anime. 
Trigun: Badlands rumble is a good, extremely re-watchable movie that any fan of space westerns and unpretentious action would enjoy, and a must-see for any fan of Trigun.

The more I watch the show the more I grow to love the characters. 
Besides the great story, one of the good things I love about MHA is the character development. Unlike annoying pair Sasuke and Sakura or every character from Black Clover, I dislike none of MHA characters, in fact I do like lots of them. 
Story: - 
Great story, Emotional sometimes, Funny most of the time, Exciting from time to time. Deku made me believe that he is a true hero by heart.  
Art: - 
Like how the creator design each one uniquely 
Sound: -  
Great.  
Character: -- 
No annoying characters to me so far, some may look useless at first but thanks to the creator, he put afford into each one of them. There is no Sasuke, Sakura, or Asta here. I can praise each one of the character all day but let's just go straight to my top -! 
-. Kacchan: Oh my young Bakugo!, the more I watch him, the more I obsess with him. What a unique character, a top class student delinquent. -- -- -- for my boy!!! 
-. Deku: This boy always find his way to move my emotion. What an optimistic and a strong heart boy 
-. All Might: ""I'm here!"" and his SMILE at all time is a -- -- --!! 
-. Aoyama Yuuga: I wish he appears more often. He is a character that always brighten up the scene. His smiley face is my fav. He made me laugh by doing nothing. 
Enjoyment:-- 
I really do enjoy the show and wander why have I postponed it til now. A while back, I tried to decide between Black clover and MHA, but I went for Black Clover, and I made the wrong choice. MHA is another level of Anime. I finished all - seasons in - days.

This will contain spoilers.  
The worst plot of an anime, which takes itself so very very serious, I've ever seen. Natural selection of parallel universes, this doesnt make any sense in any possible universe. Dont get me wrong, Im not mad because it doesnt make sense, Im mad at the constructed nonsense of this anime. Given the fact there are several parallel universes - How does them competing make any sense? It doesn't, like at all. Why can the creators of this system only leech ""energy"" from a world that wins -- robot fights? No reason. In a world where there ARE parallel universes, wouldnt there only arise even more universes? I.e. the ones that died in the first fight, the ones that died in the fourth fight etc. 
The dramaturgy doesnt work for me, we see a portrait of every kid for -- minutes, then it dies. Too many times. What remains are shallow characters, boring predictable repetitions. 
This anime will bore people who arent easily influenced by tragic music and pretentious depth weaved through far fetching words. Overall its a rather expensively produced anime, but how can this fix this boring, stupid crap? 
Also awfullness-bonus points for the consant light hearted depiction of child abuse ( not only with kana and her brother but that one episode where one of the kids being beaten by her dad is used as a running gag). 
Avoid.

Hikaru no Go is, in essence, an anime about the world of Go; about the game, the friendships and rivalries that arise in this world, the challenges, obstacles and feelings. This is a lot to actually live up to, and Hikaru no Go most certainly fills its role well. 
It starts out very simle, in a way you've probably seen before. The main character, Shindou Hikaru, encounters a paranormal apparition by coincidence while stumbling around in his shed, and only he can see it. Said apparition is, in fact, the ghost of a skilled Go player from the past, Fujiwara no Sai. He really wants to play a game of Go, and as such Hikaru brings him along to a Go salon, where he finds a kid his age which he can play. Since only Hikaru sees Sai, Hikaru must play the pieces for him. Of course, fate throws a twist by letting the opponent be a prodigy almost strong enough to become a professional Go player. Sai, skilled as he is, beats this kid, Touya Akira, to a pulp. From here, a wild goose chase after the illusion of Hikaru starts. Sai of coruse manages to get Hikaru into the game, and he eventually chases after Akira. As such we have Hikaru chasing after Akira, who again is chasing what he thinks is Hikaru. Voilá, the stage is set for an intense anime full of emotions, drama and, of course, Go.  
The plot from there is, for the most part, what I said above. Through tournaments, encounters at Go salons, school Go clubs, Inseis (aspiring professionals), and eventually the professional world of Go, we see these two chase after each other, and what remains in their wake. Quite honestly, the plot is very barebones, but that is completely irrelevant, because Hikaru no Go is in each and every way a character-driven series, which makes it in many ways more riveting and inspring than a plot-driven series. 
And characters, we lack not. Aside the intense, heart-throbbing rivalry that develops between Akira and Hikaru, there are bucketloads of interesting side characters, who range from Go club members to hardened professionals who gaze as these two young players lead on a new wave of young and skilled Go players. Mostly everyone gets an acceptable amount of development, for example the challengers; why they play and what's at stake for them are usually revealed in a gripping way - I surely don't think I've ever rooted for ten characters when all of them posed as adversaries to the main character. The professionals and newspaper people's reaction to these up-and-coming kids, it all seems so real you kind of experience their surprise and excitement at this.  
But of course, I can't get lost in the characters only; even though the characters are so good it's easy to forget the artistic qualities of the show, one must not at all forget the music and animation, which both play an impressive behind-the-scenes role in making this series what it is.  
Let me ask you one question: When you were a teen, or if you're one now, have you ever looked at a picture from when you were two-three years younger? If so, the reaction ""Holy mother of love, did I look *that* young?"" is probably a familiar one. And when you watch this series, you'll probably end up thinking the same. For this is indeed a coming-of-age anime, following Akira and Hikaru from sixth grade through ninth grade, or three years. Their growth, while seen mostly in their Go playing and their personalities, is also very much reflected in the animation. Towards the end of the series, I asked myself: ""Did they always look like that?"". When they showed us flashbacks to the beginning, I realized, they did not. While you can recognize them, it is actually impressively easy to spot that they were different. Their faces, so much more child-like, and their stature lower. Much lower. I commend Pierrot for doing such a great job of reflecting their growth physically, too. It was so smooth that I couldn't say from one episode to another that, ""hey, he looks older!"", but on an overall basis, by skipping, say, twenty or so episodes at a time, I see that they gradually change. 
Apart from that, the animators did an outstanding job. The next thing on the list is probably how they made the Go matches very interesting to watch. Just pain watching the stones being placed could've been very deterring, at least in the beginning. So instead they throw in a heap of special effects; lights, shadows, camera angles, intense effects when placing stones, even changing the background to make the game more in the center of attention, or even make a symbolic scape, for example the universe itself, symbolizing the ""world"" that is the Go board, and even the so-called Divine Move. 
In general, Pierrot did an awesome job of making the show pretty to look at. Now, even in ---- you had better-looking series, but it does not change the fact that it looks really nice. And they improve as they go on. It looks only mediocre in the first episode compared to the final episode. Among the stronger points I can mention clothes, backgrounds and effects when playing Go. The weaker parts are a bit annoying, but are mostly fixed upon as they go along, creating a most aesthetically enjoyable series. One problem is faces, which look a bit weird - at times some details are a bit misplaced -, but they do a nice job of expressiions, while not going overboard with them either, keeping a fairly serious tone. And later on, when I saw the sheer intensity in their eyes, I just thought ""whoa!"" and had to let a drop of sweat run down my cheek. The other problem is that sometimes when they placed stones on the board, the perspective was done entirely wrong, when the rest of the stones already there looked real nice. This, too, improved very much as the series went on, and in the latter stages I noticed very litte to none of this problem. 
And now, the soundtrack, which was done quite nicely. No, that's an understatement. It was inspiring and evocative, all the while not taking over the series, doing a nice job behind the scenes to build up and strengthen the emotional impacts of the show. The intense feelings of the games, the sad feelings that happened occasionally between characters, it was all done with music that reinforced those feelings and made it enjoyable to the point where I felt this tingling feeling in my stomach. The opening and ending themes are quite nice, too. The first opening, ""Get Over"" by Dream, especially; its synth-pop rythms and lyrics are very inspiring, but it doesn't completely outmatch the others; they were all very strong candidates for favoritism and defnitely a worthwhile watch. Not to mention the final ending theme, which is a ten-minute half-instrumental, half-original mix of Get Over. That was a masterful piece of music. 
All in all, Hikaru no Go provides sufficient character-driven, intense and emotional entertainment, which most people would find interesting. And don't let the pretense of a baord game like Go deter you from watching; it is hhgly enjoyable, and though I didn't really care for the Go, it remained interesting throughout the whole series. And the more enjoyable aspects of the show will definitely overshadow it if it comes to that. And for new and seasoned Go players alike, this is a very interesting ashow to watch!

(My english is not very good, haven't read the light novels, I only typed what's on my mind and what i remember + spoilers) There are - types of cancer in the world of Overlord. First the fanboys of the light novel who thinks that this piece of shit is a masterpiece and second are the sao haters who compare every isekai to sao. These fags who compare Ainz to Kirito are just absurd. Ainz is someone who's already OP because he is OP. He put his blood, sweat, tears and probably money and with the help from his guild members to become OP. Meanwhile Kirito summons an excalibur up his ass. How? Da hell should I know? This anime has harem to but it's not SAO level kind of harem. Now onto the review... I have never skipped any episode in season - because season - is so good, here I have skipped the crocodile recruitment program and I have seen fanboys who defended this arc saying you have no idea how deep and complex and political... man shut the hell up! You know instead of recruiting the lizards why not recruit another undead faction from this world? Wouldn't that be cool? Another undead leader proclaiming he's the lord of the undead from this world. It took inspiration from that - fingers vs sebas scene where the - finger proclaimed that he's the lord of the dead but what we get is Lizard sex and feeling sorry for these lizards being slaves. There is this episode and it's a cool episode where Ainz make a throne made of undead soldiers and right there he showcase his power to these Lizards and they already want to pledge to him and what did Ainz do? He rejected it so that we could go to more unnecessary battle between beetlejuice and icelizard. I thought they're just gonna beat the Lizards up but no they fucking killed them and bring them back to life and they pledge allegiance. I was like waaaaa? After everything that has happened they didn't even use these Lizards on the next arc. The screen writer was like fuck this lizards! Chekovs gun my friend! Chekovs GUN! The next arc wasn't terrible but the characters oh God! Climb and Tea Parties!? Climb, Princesses and Tea Parties? Sebas arc is good and the last - episodes are great. I want more of that last - episodes, it's the overlord that I watched in S- where there's this sense of blood pumping adrenaline for being overpowered. That's overlord to me! Not these Lizards, not climb, not princesses, and definitely not tea parties!

This anime is one example that is really desperate to keep the audience entertained by making use of a lot of cliches. We have Ayano Kannagi who yields a flame sword and a tsundere just like Shana in Shakugan no shana. We also have Kazuma Yagami whose name was derived from Death Note ""Yagami"". By the way, Yagami means God of Night in Death Note.  
The director of this anime is Junichi Sakata who passed away. I gave my condolences to him.  
The premise starts of interesting but then it gradually fell apart and become so much annoying more than before. Again, Kazuma Yagami was disowned by the Kannagi family but came back as a Wind master. In fact, he was so powerful that nobody could beat him. He is arrogant, stoic and cold-hearted but he has a calm, friendly and collected personality inside him. The problem is that the anime didn't develop Kazuma enough for me to root for him. He just comes off as another Edward Cullen. Ayano Kannagi is the worst character in this anime, she is like Louise from Familiar of Zero, so demanding, arrogant, loud-mouth. I could go on forever. In fact, she is the worst tsundere I ever came across. 
Catherine Mcdonald was also as annoying as Ayano Kannagi but she was featured in few episodes. Basically, the entire cast is so god awfully annoying that I want to stop watching this anime for good. I don't understand why people betray one another just over small thing. Of course always misunderstandings, ugh. 
This whole anime is really about arguments and fighting, nothing else, no character development at all. This anime really expect me to care more about Kazuma Yagami because he had gone through worse things than everybody else. Okay, I have seen a lot of characters who had gone through worse situations than them and yet they remain as optimistic and caring. Kazuma Yagami is another Edward Cullen. His personality is bland even though he is badass. 
If you want me to sympathise with the characters, then I want to see the characters learn how to trust and care one another like Special A. Special A starts off as annoying characters but then slowly they become great and likeable characters who learn how to trust and care for others. In fact, this was a good anime. But Kaze no Stigma is a great letdown with characters who whine and complain a lot until my ears bleed.  
One example from episode --, after Kazuma regains his memory, he kicks Ayano. Basically, the cast consists of people who are sore losers and they never learn from their mistakes. The fights are way too terrible and boring. I am not gonna say anymore. This anime is really a lot like the worse version of Zero no Tsukaima.  
Another reason why I hate this anime, the ending was terribly executed. The anime ends with Kazuma beating Ayano and Ayano chasing him around. I cannot describe in words how bad it was. The art is also very dull which deserves a -/--. 
I will give it a - out of --.  
Junichi Sakata, I am so sorry I didn't like this anime.

What part of this hentai is about a reunion at all? Who knows, and that's why it's bad. Reunion is a hentai that could only be understood in full by playing the game it is referenced from, which is also pretty average. 
It's main redeeming factor is it's artwork. Not so much the animations, but how the characters are drawn. It has the distinct PoRO art style, but unfortunately the sex poses don't change all too much. It's equivalent to just swapping cameras angles of the same scene. This drags out the scenes and swiftly becomes boring. 
While the story isn't the largest focal point for hentai, the corny plot is forced into the mix to try and make the anime seem deep. Unfortunately, watching this seems like you are thrown into the middle of the story. While this isn't bad, the story does not explain how it got there. This ends up confusing the hell out of viewers, distracting from the fap session of mediocre animations. 
The story impacts the experience due to how it is used to justify the characters and their actions. The character development is absolutely atrocious as it seemingly cockblocks a main character for seemingly no reason. In fact, all of the conflicts seem like they shouldn't have even existed due to a severe lack of context. 
In the end, Reunion is a below average hentai. As bad as the story is, its artwork is nice enough for it not to be total garbage. However, since it is not exceptional in that area, it falls below even your average hentai due to how pathetic the plot is. When the plot gets in the way of the 'plot,' you know there is an issue.

Wow. This show was a roller coaster ride, and I absolutely loved it. After watching the first episode all the way back in December, I abandoned it to watch some other shows, including Durarara!! and Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love!, but just a few weeks ago, I decided to give it another chance, and I'm so glad I did. I've been a fan of sports anime for a while, having watched and enjoyed Free! and Yowamushi Pedal (as well as planning to watch Kuroko no Basuke when i get a chance), but Haikyuu!! went above and beyond my expectations and quickly became my favorite sports anime and definitely one of my favorite anime just in general. 
But enough about me, let's get onto the volleyball. 
The huge overarching plot is your typical sports anime kind of thing, where the main team has to overcome the obstacles presented by other teams in order to win the championship or whatnot. In that, Haikyuu!! isn't really anything special or different from other anime in its genre. But that's okay, because it makes way for this series' biggest strong point: the impressive characters and characterization. 
Of course, Hinata and Kageyama are the main characters, and their relationship is focused on the most throughout the series. They're both written extremely well, and they also have a ton of character development, both individually and as a team. But they by all means aren't the only characters in the series, and the producers make sure you know that extremely well, by making sure you both get to know and in some cases fall in love with the other, more minor characters. From the tough-looking teddy bear spiker Azumane Asahi to the super-energetic ""fight me!"" attacker Tanaka Ryuunosuke, as well as all the other characters you meet, the series lets you meet your teammates and know them really well, almost as if you were playing on a real team instead of watching one. Most of them also undergo a lot of character development themselves, Asahi really standing out among the rest of the team, although I can think of at least two other characters who undergo some as well. However, the main cast is huge, making for some characters to almost get left out of the action. Yamaguchi Tadashi especially comes to mind, as he sometimes gets a little bit of the spotlight, then practically disappears for episodes at a time. And even so, some of the other characters barely get focused on at all.  
But that's not it. Along with getting to know your teammates, you also get to know your rivals and your enemies, too. After all, Karasuno High has to play against someone to win, right? There's  a lot of focus on rival school Nekoma High and its players, especially quiet setter Kenma, in a few episodes, and the match against ""Iron Wall"" blocking central Dateko has a lot of focus on their team, too.  
The greatest school other than Karasuno to get the spotlight, however, is definitely Aoba Johsai, Karasuno's true rival. Not only does the team have a lot of players from Kageyama's middle school, but their captain, Oikawa Tooru, is given a huge spotlight on his own in the later episodes of the series. I won't spoil it, of course, but while you might hate him early on, Oikawa just might become one of your favorite characters, and his motivations are both relatable and heart-wrenching. Aoba Johsai will probably make you question who you're actually rooting for, due to the amazing characterization on both sides of the net. That's what happened for me, at least. 
The sound is great, the characters all have lots of expression and they all are voiced extremely well. The voice cast was wonderful to listen to, and Oikawa's ""Yahoo!~"" never gets old. Plus, the music is great. The openings and endings are all extremely catchy, but the OST that plays during the show itself is also a work of art that enhances the feeling of the series a lot and contributes to its success. 
The art is also pretty great, being from Production I.G. and all, and in some cases it enhances the over-the-top feeling of the show, which I loved. There were bits when it seemed a bit repetitive, but overall, it was great visually. Some of the facial expressions were pretty hilarious, too.  
Haikyuu!!, overall, is a great anime, one of the best in its genre, at least in my opinion. But hey, I played a lot of volleyball before watching the show, so maybe it's just me. Either way, it's an extremely fun watch, and it gets even better as the show goes on, at least until you end up crying over something or another. Even then, you will still love it. The elements all combine to create an amazing experience, and the characters especially stand out as characters you may just fall in love with. I'm extremely excited for season -, and if it's anywhere as good as this season, it'll be a hit in my book.

How is this the best-rated feature-length anime on here? Honestly, I can't figure this out. I kind of feel cheated by this near-unanimous praise, as I personally couldn't enjoy or relate to this story nearly as much as everyone else did, apparently. 
[NO OBVIOUS SPOILERS BELOW, JUST A RATHER VAGUELY-WORDED PERSONAL OPINION. GOING TO KEEP IT SHORT, ANYWAY] 
The plot is predictable almost every step of the way, a weak and quite transparent attempt to ""pull at your heartstrings"". The best word to describe the characters is... bland. Virtually nothing in the story makes the viewer actually care about them on any deeper level beyond the very surface. Basically an ""okay, might as well see this thing through to the end"" type of situation. No real investment, no real emotional impact.  
I have no serious qualms about the animation itself; on the visual side, this was okay. I guess. Nothing spectacular about it though. From the get-go, this wasn't the type of anime to aspire to create a particularly creative visual style, however, so that's fair. Sound-wise, it's also nothing mindblowing... rather boring, actually. 
To fans of this anime (and we know there's fans galore), it might seem like I'm reaching to just find stuff to criticize, but I seriously, honestly did not enjoy this much at all. I'm baffled at how well-loved this is, and I'm... sorry? I really was prepared to like this -- I didn't.

--- Warning: Contains spoilers --- 
Most series can be summed up in a few words, and regardless of their implications, some descriptions may throw you for a loop. When you hear the words triangles, music, missiles, more music and even more missiles, what is it that you think of? Most well-versed anime viewers should be thinking of the Macross franchise, as this can effectively sum up a great portion of what it's all about, ranging from the original series to the latest installment entitled Frontier. 
Macross Frontier happens to be a fairly ordinary anime that in its simplicity, loses  direction as it progresses, only to attempt to get back on track after wasting lots of time. When you break it down, at least half of the episodes are fillers, and a majority of the rest are short arcs that don't really connect  and flow together to form a solid plot like any good series would. Since this is not an episodic series,  this format begins to hurt itself in the long run, as only little bits of crucial information about the grand scheme of things are revealed throughout the series.  This makes the progression of the main plot very slow and unnecessarily dragged out. It's not until the final third of the series that it decides to focus on what can be considered the main plot. Up until this point, the plot was nothing more than a simple ""Defend the human race from unknown aliens"", which is already weak in and of itself as it's really just a poor excuse for some mecha action, but it decided to take a sharp --- and go down the oh so wonderful conspiracy route.  
With this development that couldn't help but be expected many episodes  prior, everything starts to become a giant mess. This was hinted to a few times throughout the beginning of the series, usually only for a very short time period in select episodes displaying things like undercover discussions or trades, so it's not like it came on unforeseen by the audience. If anything, it happened far too late, as the motives behind Grace and Leon who were originally working together are hardly delved into, and they simply play the bad-guy role because the series needed a better antagonist than random aliens. Both individuals having very grandiose goals of wanting to rule the universe, you can't help but wonder how they actually planned on executing this in the first place. It is only explained after Grace O'Connor, the great evil mastermind behind everything, had her plans proceed to completion without any hitch at all. Now, having full control over the Vajra, it's pretty safe to say she holds much more power than anyone else currently, yet, of course, is defeated by the power of... music (Catchy j-pop music at that). A lot of build up was wasted in favor of going this predictable route, and it is basically the equivalent of beating the bad guy through the power of friendship. At the very least, they tried to give some basis for this being possible with information from earlier episodes explaining the power of music within the Macross universe.  
Seeing as this all happened in the span of a few episodes, it's safe to say that pacing became a huge issue, and solidified the fact that most of the other episodes were nothing more than ""filler"" and short arcs. They could have used this time to begin to develop the plot, but that wasn't the case. They may as well have cut out these episodes in favor of getting straight to the point, rather than extending the series unnecessarily. With the remaining episodes  not being devoted to plot advancement, some character development should  be expected in them, however, it's nowhere near as much as there should have been for how much time was devoted to this aspect. A majority of the remaining episodes used most of their time focused on the love triangle between the three main characters, but the events and developments that took place were usually undermined due to the indecisive and undeveloped protagonist of the series, Alto Saotome. He is also better known by some of the characters as Princess Alto, and for good reason.  
And while it may not all necessarily be because of him, he is directly involved in many of the simple plot conveniences used to keep the love triangle from moving forward. Whether it be going out to fight against the Vajra during a crucial time when he was supposed to be with Ranka, or Ranka seeing him with Sheryl and then wallowing in her own sadness about it afterwards.  However, with Alto being the resident princess of the series, it's not a far stretch to say he certainly can act like one at times. Ranging from his daddy issues leading to him running away from home to become a pilot, or how he likes to ignore any real problems that he faces, there's almost nothing about him that doesn't scream ""Princess"". He even has gorgeous flowing locks of hair to accentuate this. In fact, I have no doubt that some would start to question his manhood, as he practically ignores any advances from both Sheryl and Ranka, which goes back to him being largely at fault for the triangle never progressing. Any time it seems like he's made up his mind about who he wants to be with, the next episode has some bad news for you, as he basically does the equivalent of saying ""Just kidding!"", and begins to show what can be considered interest in the opposite girl. As for the whole ""Princess"" nickname and his daddy issues, they are touched on briefly, but it comes off as nothing more than the writers quickly throwing together some semblance of a back story so that they could pass him off as more than your average self-insert main character.  
Having Alto bounce back and forth between who it seemed he was interested in clearly shows which characters are supposed to be the selling point of the series, and of course, I can only be talking about Ranka and Sheryl. Long winded fan boy name calling and debates aside for now, they both have their ups and downs as characters. 
Ranka, who is easily the character who receives the most focus in the series, happens to be the one who receives the least development for all the time she spent on screen (Go figure). She manages to slowly get over her timid nature when it comes to singing, but only because of the encouragement Alto gives her throughout the series. Although this was good however, even with her having the most interaction with other characters and general screen time, she never developed a reason for singing past doing it for Alto's affection. Due to the fact that the time spent on her was poorly utilized, her development was hindered in the long run. This is made especially apparent when you see that a few of the side characters have more motivation for their actions than she does. For the sheer amount of focus the series gave her character, seeing them do nothing with it past the first few episodes was disappointing to say the least.  
Sheryl, on the other hand, plays a much more interesting role in the series. Many pass her off as ""Bitchy"", ""Overly arrogant"" and many other demeaning terms from the moment she appears on screen, but she manages to easily become the best character in the cast. With her status established right from the beginning, it's not unfitting for her to act much like she runs the place. Providing a stark contrast from Ranka, Sheryl is confident and domineering to an extent, yet still caring of others, shown by her attitude towards Ranka and Alto. She eventually softens up a bit, mostly due to her feelings for Alto since he doesn't worship her like everyone else in the colonies. The struggle she goes through while falling from the top as Ranka took over is far more believable than anything Ranka or Alto went through. Having to cope with her fall from stardom, as well as her impending death due to a disease, she accepts these facts and still tries to move forward, doing the only thing she can do: sing. This made her far more endearing to the audience by the end of the series, as this shows her confidence wasn't simply based on her status as the Galactic Fairy, but her strength of will that was built up through living her old lifestyle of complete poverty. While she did remain mostly static, what she went through didn't feel contrived, much like the case was with Ranka.  
But of course, like many other series, one of the biggest problems Macross Frontier presents is the ending. Again, I find myself questioning Alto's sexuality, as the ending provides zero closure for what is considered the main focus of the series: the love triangle between the three main characters. This is Macross, the plot is only there to help move the romance forward, and that's one thing Frontier severely failed at. Not only was Alto himself preventing it from taking a big step forward with his indecisiveness and constant character changes, the sheer amount of conveniences that kept the character's relationships from developing sure didn't help either. Like I mentioned, the filler episodes would mostly focus on the love triangle, but focusing on it is not the same as actually having it progress. Regardless of how much it actually progressed by the end, a conclusion is needed, and that's something the series never provided. While it was very heavily suggested that Sheryl ""won"" before the finale, the final moments of the series throw the entirety of the few episodes Alto was together with Sheryl right out the window, and has Ranka enter the competition once more.  
As we all know, Alto has a major fascination for the sky, more so than for the two girls who fawned over him for the entire series. So what does he do? He doesn't clearly choose either girl, but instead chooses the mother fucking sky. Whether it was intentionally done this way so that the Sheryl and Ranka factions wouldn't destroy the world due to a simultaneous outburst of angry fan boys crying over the fact that their waifu ""lost"", or because they wanted to leave it up for interpretation, it doesn't change the fact that giving no closure severely impacts the series in a bad way. And when one of the main selling points of the Macross franchise is left untouched, it leaves nothing more than disappointment in the eyes of fans and newcomers alike. While making no decision on which girl the main character wants to be with may be a common occurrence in most harem series, it should not be the case when there is only a love triangle at hand. When ample time is given to devote to two characters and their interactions with the main character, going down this route is nothing more than a bad decision as it should be nearly impossible to get fans to feel satisfied with this kind of ending. It was a shame to see them use this kind of cheap exit strategy after putting forth the effort to develop the relationships in the series.   
After all of this, there's nothing left but disappointment in the series. There may have been good j-pop, great action scenes, as well as throwbacks to previous entries in the franchise ranging from songs, to name drops and simple phrases, but that only adds to the enjoyment factor. And as most intelligent people will know, even that isn't enough to save a series which continually makes mistakes along the way. At the end of the day, Macross Frontier had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was ruined by Alto who could not manage to keep the series flying smoothly.

From the perspective of someone who watched the original anime and read (most of) the manga, this remake has been absolutely amazing to watch, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested enough to be reading this. 
The plot seems to follow the manga source material a bit more closely than the original ---- anime. I found this refreshing because certain characters and key scenes are presented differently from the ---- version. 
While the portrayal of the manga plot deviates slightly from the original anime, the visuals, animation and character art are certainly significantly different, and this may take awhile to get used to, especially if you have been watching the original multiple times over the years. Personally, I'm into the -th episode now, and this has ceased to be an issue. 
Regardless of these differences in presentation, the humanity of the storyline and the complexities of the characters certainly continue to shine through, giving the series great emotional appeal. It is not easy for remakes to fulfill audience expectations from the source material while bringing a fresh perspective to the story, but the creators and cast of this new series seem to have done an excellent job so far.

I loved this show for a number of reasons. Firstly i think the premise is great, a show about tanuki but in which there mostly portrayed as human, or human-ish. What i really like is that this isnt just about mythology is in modern day, about being a tanuki in a human world, its about growing up, living with death, being a big brother, childhood rivalries and loyalty. Its a quite deep show, despite the fact for the most part it is a comedy, and it is great at fulfilling that purpose its both wacky, zany and hilarious, but we also really explore the characters as we try to understand the death of their farther. The story arc over the course of the -- episodes is well paced and timed, nothing to complex but it is good fun and did have me wanting to watch more without a doubt. My favourite part of this show is the artwork though, the animation style is fantastic, just beautiful and really suits the tone of the show, when you watch it you will understand. This is nothing to intense, but neither is it to light that it could lose your attention, another great work from P.A. Works!

After various recommendations to watch this anime, Code Geass, I have finally done it. 
So after completing both seasons R- and R-, I can fully judge this anime with no restrictions of knowledge. 
The anime's start was amazing, it was that of something that baited the person to watch it. It was very exciting and eye catching how the Japanese or should I say, ""--"" were being treated to which lead further on to massacre. The giving of Lelouch's power was exciting and made him feel unique even though he faces other Geass members in the future. The only problem I had have with this anime is the convenient timing of events. The Euphemia event was just a sad way to lead unto plot change and I was really triggered by that. The main thing that really got me mad is that, no one seems to die in this anime at all. You ask ""what do you mean? There were a lot of casualties in this anime."" Yes there was, but some 'deaths' were just brutal and not impossible to live. In the next episode we see that person whom appossedly was exploded by a huge energy wave. Walks like normal in a couple of episodes after, that such as Princess Cornelia. The woman who was left to bleed to death, somehow is alive in a couple episodes further... Or her subordinate whom was exploded by the ""FLEIJA"" and lived. That's right, a bomb that has enough power to kill and destroy a whole city isn't powerful enough to kill one person which just comes down to plot armor. This is an slightly rushed ending but this is my opinion about this anime.

In this day & age it's sometimes very hard to find something original, the anime as a form of art has now become so generic & predictable with typical shounen & typical ecchi spewing around us from all direction that it is really hard to remember sometimes that this is not only a form of entertainment (or rather shameless fan service) but it is also a form of art. And fortunately there are still anime's like ""Uchouten Kazoku"" still being made to remind us just that. 
Story 
This was actually based on a novel by Tomihiko Morimi which is the story of a family, of a certain peculiar family at that, cause the members of this family aren't human. This is a story of a ""Tanuki"" family. Early on our protagonist tells us about the world he lives in, a fictional version of modern Kyoto, where Tanuki, Tengu & Humans co-habit, humans are obviously at the head of the food chain, and Tengu's are creatures that can fly. So what are Tanuki's? They are shape-shifting raccoon dogs (bet you didn't see that one coming). This is the story of four brothers of a tanuki family , their mothers & their friends; the head of the family that is their father was eaten by a group of human called ""Friday Fellows"" who eat tanuki every year as a tradition in their year end bash. I know this seems confusing so far, but believe me under this weird exterior there is a really beautiful story. We get to observe the life of this family through the eye of one of the brother's, our main character Yasaburo. We get to know this beautifully imagined fantasy world, face the challenges you have to face by being a shape-shifting tanuki, and get to know the truth behind how the head of the Shimogamo family really died. 
From the small little funny bits like Yasaburo warming his butt (or else he will catch could); to his weird shape-shifting practices; to all the allegory about an actual loving family-life, the nature of humans & the corruption in our political circle now-a-days everything is written in a almost flawless way. There is layer upon layer of details on every scene & intelligent dialogues throughout the show. 
The story is almost flawless in what it tries to achieve, it gets - out of -- from me. 
Characters 
The characters are so meticulously imagined by the writer that it really shows the amount of dedication & care he really gave his work. From the responsible yet too much trying older brother Yaichiro, to the carefree yet guilt ridden Yajiro, to the ""most idiotic of the blood"" Yasaburo, to the timid and shy Yashirou all the brothers are so well developed characters. There is their loving mother (who is one of the most realistic mother figures I have seen in an anime); the mysterious & unpredictable Benten (who you will be constantly wondering about, if you should love her or hate her); their angry & irritable sensei Prof. Akadama; the loveable Kaisei; and many other artistically written characters. 
Most of the characters are so well written & well developed that is really unique in this times cause now-a-days most of the animes have --% generic characters (even some good ones do lack in this department). 
It gets another - out of --. 
Art/Animation 
This anime also features very unique art, all the character designs are delicate and drawn with style, the backgrounds are colorful, all in all it does portray the wacky & weird image we get from the story quite nicely. Occasionally there are some scenes which are a bit flawed or feels out of place but overall the art & animations fits the nature of the theme that the writer tries to convey almost perfectly. 
It gets -.- out of --.  
Sound 
The opening theme is ""Uchouten Jinsei"" by milktubIt  & the ending theme is ""Qué Será, Será"" by fhána,. I really like the opening song which fits nicely with the sense of wackiness this anime first tries to establish in its viewers, I get where the ending song is coming from, it was definitely aiming to get in touch with the other side of the story that was the beauty of it but I don't think the song does add that much on the total experience. It might seem a bit unusual but I liked the sound effects used in the actual anime much better than the actual opening and ending theme, there is a bit of keyboard (or other instrument) piece in some of the intense sequences which is quite beautiful, and the other bits used on emotion sequences were quite exceptional to me too. 
The sound gets on the whole solid - out of --. 
This is the kind of anime that reminds me of why I am still sticking with this genre of entertainment. Just when the anime world is filled with generic hero fights endlessly to save the world or a girl or closet pervert hero gets caught in between lots of big breasted & scantily clothed females if you really look hard enough you find gems like this. This kinds of stories rejuvenates the believer in me (on a side note it also makes me sad that I don't know Japanese, or I could have read the original book). 
This is a must watch anime & one of the best of the season and of ----. Don't waste your time reading this review just go watch it.

- out of --.

That was so intense! I have never seen an anime that could infuse so many elements into one package without being overwhelmed. It has action, clever and thoughtful plot drive and plot twists, comedy, sincere moments (""feels""), vivid animation, and of course a touch of fan service without going too far. It engaged my attention and drove me to think about what I was watching every episode, and that counts for something. This is certainly a rare gem, and I avidly await season - with high expectations. 
Now I should note, this is a series you are either going to love or hate. No middle ground. At least from the other reviews I've read, that seems to be the case.

An interesting series with an unusual twist -- people living like fish underwater -- but fails to deliver quality in so many ways.   
Really, I wanted to love this series.  The characters are really interesting and well developed in the story line, and we come to know a lot about many of them.  But that's one of the few positive comments I have for this story. 
So what didn't work? 
-.  Basic science.  You cannot cook with flame under water.  You cannot see tears on people's faces underwater.  You cannot see clouds clearly underwater.  The whole idea of living underwater being exactly the same as living on the surface, except that you have fish in the sky instead of birds -- is a real stretch to accept, but okay, lets accept it and move on... 
-. The whole interaction with The Scale of the Sea God.  It never really made any sense.  How can we accept that everyone's fates are ruled over by a moody vengeful sea god who communicates through an arrogant, haughty, lazy shrine spirit? 
-. Too many love triangles.  This show was love triangle OVERLOAD.  Every single one of the main characters was dealing with an object of affection that was either actually or perceived to be in love with another person.  It was just too much to swallow, and frankly turned an otherwise really good drama into a tragic parody of one. 
-. The main character Hikari is too loud and too angry most of the time.  Its very hard to really like him as a person when he's always fighting with everyone.  It is only late in the series does he become nice enough to actually like. 
-. None of the main circle of friends honestly shares their feelings, which creates even more problems for everyone.  Ok, this is a personal pet peeve about Japanese anime of the romance/drama genre.  People are too afraid to be honest, and the story goes from tortured bad to tortured worse.  Incredibly frustrating for the viewer.  Kind of like watching the girl in a haunted house decide that its a good idea to go down into the root cellar.   Come ON!  Give us a break.  Please!! 
Here's my bottom line.  If you like high-school romance stories, you will probably enjoy this series, at least a little.  It does have some interesting and unique moments, especially involving time travel into the future by some of the group.  Just be prepared for lots of loose ends and tortured turn-downs during confessions of feelings.

With Infinite Stratos, I only watched through it mostly because i wanted a good laugh. Not because it was a comedy, but just because of how bad it could get. The story mostly surrounds a boy who gets put into an all girls school because he's the only male that can operate these machines. Why is he the only male? Why can females only use them? Don't ask, you're here for tits. This is the equivalent of to love ru but with mechas. But don't get too carried away because there is no advancements from the MC to the females.  
The main character is basically autistic so get used to him not catching on to the clues that the girls around him want the cock. He also needs help because he literally can't do shit so that's when the girls come in to aid him in everything.  Now i can dive into a super informative review of how this anime sucked or how it did decent or whatever, but you don't need to.You sit there, pop a squat (or occasionally pop a stiffy) and you watch for tits and ass and all that. Want amazing plot or just a good romance? Spice and wolf or Toradora. Want a good Mecha? Idk any good mecahs but find one that's highly ranked and go for it. Same goes for season - of this show since the formula is repeated.

Kimi Ni Todoke is definitely one of my favorites of this season and perhaps of all the animes i've seen. And if you're into romance/everyday life storys, then this one's definitely for you!  
It's basically about a girl name Sawako and something about her scares off some people so they keep a distant from her. She just never had friends but then one day, she meets a boy name Kazehaya, who's very outgoing and friendly and popular. She looks up to him and her life slowly changes after meeting him.  
Story: 
Even though i haven't finished the series yet, I know it gets - out of --. The story wouldn't be considered brilliant or a real masterpiece, but it has a very good calmness to it and the story is enjoyable to watch. There are a few conflicts here and there, but throughout the series, it keeps good consistency and gets me interested as more the series goes on. I must say this series seems to go really really slow for me. But I don't blame the producers since the manga story isn't that long and they've got -- episodes to fill. ANYWHOS, it's a cute love story and has alot of funny scenes. 
Art:  
I love love this style of art. It's very pretty and cute at the same time. The OP and ED animation are fantastic and very relaxing for me o.o  
I can't really explain how the animation is, but it's great.  
Sound:  
I can't wait to get the OST when it comes out (or did it already come out hm..). The BGM are blended so well with certain scenes and they did a grreat job at it. I would say most of them are relaxing and very cute.  
Character:  
Man, all the characters are great in this series, even the 'bad' characters. You just can't help but feel for them and in the end, like them as well. Knowing that Kimi Ni Todoke is all about romance and slice of life, I definitely didn't expect a really evil character that wants to kill people, and that's pretty obvious.  
Overall, I really enjoyed it so far and I know I'll still enjoy watching it until the last episode of the series. It's one of those shows when you can watch it on a relaxing sunday afternoon and what not. And yes, there are a couple sad scenes, espcially when watching what Sawako has to deal with, but in the end, it leaves you with a good feeling and i dont know if i should say this, but it makes me sort of happier? Anyway, try it.

I just can't describe how absolutely horrible this anime was for me. 
I like little sister anime, cringe with charm.  
THIS however was cringe for the sake of ""comedy"" and they failed miserably. 
They recognise their own stupidity and try to make it a Cligé ""oh that girl is dumb but cute"" moments and that is what angers me. 
the art is pretty okay, nothing great. but the characters are dumb as a potato and not cute as they try to make them to be. 
Please if you want to want better anime go watch ""Boku no pico"" i found that more enjoyable than this. 
Judge me how you want, i don't care

When one guy says that this was more of a "" baby-making JRPG series"" then he's very much right, cu'z this is what this anime for.....the plot in more simplistic term just suck, it just a guy from another world with his cousin who arrive in some place called ""Granvania"" that has all the magic and tech and yet has to rely on an ordinary guy to do the fighting for them. From there , it becomes a guy having to supposed make babies called ""Star Children"" from each girls who represent certain constellation, what make it worse was the addition of a --th constellation that should even exist , man them Japs alawys have the stupid notion that adding an extra would make the story plot good , like what they did with  Rokka no Yuusha where there should be - heroes but they  added a -th which makes the anime's title a sham.......The only thing good about this anime was the eye candy around here and yes they're the harem members, that compose of - MILFs , - Lolis and - same age girls, oh and let's not forget the girl that used to be a plushy. I would have given this anime a - if the guy ends up with his cousin and them girls and star children stayed behind and lets not forget the addition of a -- harem member that used to be a talking flying plushy that become a human girl right after it followed the harem to the guy's world. Ya know I really soo hate this anime that mentioning the characters name is like calling me names. So no more BS and here is how I rate this shit.  
Story: pathetic -: One of studio Gonzo's worse anime after Rosario + vampire.  
Art: Good -- It was the only silver lining in this anime cu'z of the eye candies.  
Sound: fair --  Coz' I don't give a fuck as to who did who.  
Character: pathetic -- Like I've said I sooooo hate this anime and the character that mentioning it was just like bad words. 
Enjoyment: Pathetic -- Very predictable and you only need to watch the -st - episodes and the last - episodes, everything else , U jaz skip.  
Overall: Pathetic -- This would have been better off as a hentai than anything else. Hate to say it ,  but this was probably director Motonaga Keitarou's worse project ever.  
Merry Christmas.

This review covers the first - episodes. 
First, this definitely isn't a PG-- show, it is a PG show for kids.  I don't care what the page says. 
Story: 
The story is bland and essentially copied from better similar mange/anime.  There are tons of ""Japanese student summoned to alternate world to be a hero"" anime out there, and I'm not saying they can't be interesting or have new twists on the ides...but this one doesn't.  It's boring and derivative.  If evaluated as a PG rather than PG-- show, the shallowness of the plot makes some sense, though that is not really an excuse. 
Characters 
The characters are complete morons, so stupid it's painful to watch.  The kind of stupidity that makes you want to yell and throw things at your TV.  Again, if you're - years old, perhaps you won't notice, but to anyone else, all the characters are one dimensional idiots who appear unable to do anything except blindly yell and hack at their problems. 
Animation 
The animation would have been at best mediocre -- years ago, and is incomprehensibly bad for something coming out today.  There are a TON of really bad still shots, and when they bother to have the characters move they do it poorly.  Fights generally consist of a poorly animated charge, a flash of white with a sound affect, and then a combatant flies backwards or has some other spell effect. 
Sound 
The sound is fine.  That's literally the best thing I can say for this show. 
I give this -/-- and giving it a - is being generous.

""If you trip while running down a hallway you will get a nosebleed. If you trip in life, you'll cry."" 
-Minorin Kushieda 
~Toradora! 
You have that average romantic comedy mixed with high school slice of life. ""Boy meets girl, girl meets boy."" 
So far nothing that interesting, then, why is it an -? Not a - or less? In my opinion, it differs in plenty of ways from the average romantic comedy and I'll try to explain why. 
Story: -/-- 
I'd compare its story to potato chips *--*  
It's kind of addictive. 
You eat the first one, it's good, then you get another, and another, and another, when you realize you ate it all and sometimes wants even more. That's the feeling this show gave me. 
It all starts with silly romance, turning into bittersweet love and ending with a little bit of drama. J.C.Staff managed to adapt the light novel into -- episodes without leaving anything behind. 
The plot is mainly about Ryuji and Taiga trying to find how they really feel and, what they want for their lifes. You get funny, embarassing and even more serious moments during the show. 
Art: --/-- 
It is not that awesome, you won't get those eye catching ""landscape visuals"" like the ones you see in ""-cent.persecond"" or ""Clannad"" neither the details like in ""K-ON"". Basically the main scenario is the school and its surroundings. 
However, they focus into the characters drawing, giving them really convincing looks and expressions, something that is really important in these kind of romance/drama series. All the scenes were carefully animated. 
I also enjoyed the colors and the animation they made for the -nd OP/ED ""Silky Heart"" and ""Orange"". It matched with the tone of the music perfectly.  
OST/OP/ED: --/-- 
(...) 
Damn violins ~_~' 
""Lost my Pieces"" ->  remember the name of this song because you'll never forget it. It may be one of the most touching I've ever listened to. The OST for this serie was so well done that even if the situation wasn't that touching, by hearing this song (along with ""Yuugure no Yakusoku"" and ""Yasashisa no Ashioto"") you'd get really depressed. 
About the OP and ED, 'Pre-parade' was good for introducing the characters and all but I found 'Vanilla Salt' weird. In compensation I really liked 'Silky Heart' and 'Orange' since it followed the pace of the story. If you take a closer look, you can notice that the song summarize the events of the last episodes and show how the characters' relationships are progressing. 
Characters: --/-- 
Unique ones. 
It's interesting because you have the characters that every high school classroom have with their own problems, but somehow they get to know each other better, and build up a friendship despite their differences. The (aparently) antisocial guy with scary looks, the hardworking class representant, the (weird) captain of the girls' softbal team, the (chibi) tsundere and (of course) the popular and beautiful transferred student (who's also a model). Mix them all and you have a interesting group. 
Character development was also well done. You can notice that the OP change to 'Silky Heart' (that's much more serious) just when things gets less carefree and more tense between the characters. After ep. -- you have more drama than comedy comparing to the first episodes. And you start to get the feeling that things are leading to an end. 
I wish Ami would get more screen time... (I won't spoil here) but there was a lot more to show of her. She was put aside in the final episodes, like Kitamura (the difference is that his arc had already ended...) 
Overall Enjoyment: -/-- 
I bought the premium edition when it came out, and just finished rewatching it for the -rd time. After all this time I can say: it's still exciting. Like I read in another review, it's a cute show. Relaxing to watch and heartwarming. It have its sad moments, but everything work out well in the end. 
I consider it a must of the romantic comedies. Especially if you watched something like Clannad or Air that left that feeling of sadness/melancholy, Toradora! will cheer you up again. 
Happy endings ftw! :- 
It was longer than I expected... Hope it was helpful!

“It all started with that chord I played. I had no idea that I was strumming hard on his heartstrings with my own fingers.” 
Uenoyama stumbles upon Satou, a sleepy stranger with a broken guitar on the stairs of their high school. Recognizing it just needs the strings replaced, and also seeing how bummed Satou was, he begrudgingly flies into action. One strum on the newly-fixed guitar, and well, you read the opening quote.  
This first, chance meeting not only does a terrific job at introducing us to these characters and their personalities, but it also encapsulates so much of what I loved about this show, specifically its symbolism. In a way, guitar strings are not unlike a person’s heart. Yes, they can break often. But they can also be fixed, although sometimes you need a helping hand. And then, if the right chords are struck at the right time, something beautiful can blossom. Now, does this symbolism sound a little cheesy and heavy-handed? Maybe, but it works. And besides, a little cheesiness in a love story is not necessarily a bad thing. 
To quickly get this out of the way: as a straight guy, I realize this show was very much not made with me in mind, but I heard positive things, so I decided to give it a shot. Did I regret it? Well, let’s read on. 
The cast is a small, but strong one. I’ve already mentioned the two main characters, Satou and Uenoyama. The former plays the role of the quiet understudy. He wants to learn the guitar, but despite carrying around a fairly expensive one, has little to no knowledge. But you know who does? Uenoyama. Personality-wise, he’s very much the Yin to Satou’s Yang, or vice versa. Although he’s not a mean-spirited guy, he can be prone to angry outbursts. Just based on that little knowledge, you can see how this might lead to some interesting interactions. And without getting into spoiler territory, one of these guys has some serious demons of the past to conquer, and obviously that plays a big role in the story. 
Then we have the other two members of Uenoyama’s band. Akihiko is the cool, calm, and collected drummer. Haruki is sort of the reliable older brother of the group. They’re not super involved in the main pair’s relationship, but they are able to dole out some timely advice, and have a unique dynamic and history themselves. They’re strong additions to a small, but very likeable cast. In fact, I found myself quickly attached to all four.  
The animation might not blow you away like Kimestsu no Yaiba, but it’s quite effective at capturing the mood of the scenes and the emotions of the characters. And, although I’m not the one to ask, I do think the female audience will be satisfied with the male characters in the show. 
For a series about music, I wasn’t necessarily blown away by the music, outside of the opening. It wasn’t bad, but the band doesn’t have a song that got stuck in my head the way some of the songs from, say Nana, did. The voice acting was however, quite good. I feel like the VAs did a great job at capturing the essence of these characters. 
The story, while not spectacular, does its job. It may seem like a straight-forward story about four young guys and their band, but the romance, along with one of the character’s dark past casting a giant shadow over everything, keeps you interested. Then there's the issue of romance within the band that presents a bit of an obstacle, as well. 
Overall, I really enjoyed Given. I think some might be skeptical, given some of the slightly sleazier shows the genre has offered up in the past, but those people would be pleasantly surprised if they gave this show a shot. Is it perfect or ground-breaking? No, but it has a tremendous amount of heart, and I’d recommend it to any anime fan. 
A solid - out of -- from me.

To much drama to enjoy the show. To much Death, to painful to enjoy any part of it. 
Thanks to the Dramatic climax of season -, i now have a destroyed door in my home from the rage it inspired. There was absolutely no need to make events turn out the way they did. i truly hope the creator gets some what he has coming to him from someone..  
The comedy at times is Sick... not in a good way.. it uses dramatic events of sadness and tries to use them as comedy at times and that is just wrong. 
i dont understand why people really enjoy this show and give it high ratings when its absolutely dark and sad... its not enjoyable to watch good innocent people have the worst possible thing ever happen to them. Humans are sick for enjoying that....

Just finished watching Sakurasou no Pet Na Kanojo. It was very good. I watched it to my heart's content. It's filled with emotions, friendship, inspirations, slice of life, school, romance and a lot of comedy. The comic parts of the story are very unique. I could not help but laugh loud. I don't remember I enjoyed a romantic-comedy anime this much.

Whew! It's not often that an anime leaves me on the edge of my seat craving for more and more and makes hours seem like minutes. The Promised Neverland did exactly that.  
Each episode of this brilliant anime was very gripping. I was curious and interested throughout. Not one second felt like it was draggy or boring. Everything was pure gold. 
The story is set in an ""orphanage"" which contains -- children of different age groups, the oldest being ----- years. The three main characters Emma, Norman, and Ray are the brightest kids in the orphanage. Their IQ is higher than that of most adults I've met. Anyway, all the children wonder why none of the children sent away to foster homes never write back. Also, even though the kids are allowed to live freely, they aren't allowed to go beyond the ""gates"".  
At the end of the first episode itself, the main characters figure out what lies beyond the forbidden gates and start making plans to escape. 
I absolutely love how the caretaker ""Mom"" and the kids constantly try to outsmart each other. And the plans they come up with to escape even though they have no knowledge of what is out there. Each little bit of this anime was just amazing. 
I definitely recommend this anime --/--. It truly is a gem!

Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first --- episodes. 
Story: 
It was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team - (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until Sasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part -] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden) 
Art: 
A bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic. 
Sound: 
If you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else. 
Characters: 
They are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters. 
Overall: 
I loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode --- and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it.

Being a fervent BONES fan, I greatly enjoyed Dark than BLACK. But I seriously admit that I often had no idea what the hell they were talking about with the gate and stuff. The reason I liked Darker than BLACK so much was because it had a lot of style. And I like style! Not to mention Hei was an interesting character who also had style!! A very good anime. The fighting scenes had great choreography, and I just wish it had more action scenes. Intense storyline too. Since it's only -- episodes, I recommend people give it a watch and see for themselves.

Some things do not mix. Oil and water. Love and logic. Oranges and toothpaste. And as far as entertainment goes, action and comedy. Not to say they are binary, no. Comic relief to break the pace of seriousness and action to sober up the silly work well together as long as they do not deviate from the tone of the show. The tone has to be dominant. When you try to mix equal parts comedy and action, it says to me, ""If you're not taking this seriously, why should I?"" And ""The Devil is a Part-Timer!"" from the renowned studio White Fox got me asking that question more than once. 
The premise is something out of a network sitcom. The Devil and one of his Generals are forced to leave their world and make a living in the hustle and bustle that is the big city. A fish out of water story is nothing new, but the idea that the most evil being in existence suddenly adapts modern sensibilities in the span of a single episode already has me doubting the premise. Was he THAT bad? The backstory speaks of genocide and destruction caused that hands of Satan and his generals, so he clearly was living up to the mythos- but now I'm supposed to like him because he's taking his job at MgRonald's with the same seriousness as he does conquering the lands of his home world? Okay, fine. There are some genuinely funny moments early on, but then to see the Hero show up and forgive all his evil deeds, too? Makes me feel they set the stakes way too high early on. 
The show then slips into a slice of life type motif. The Devil reduced to a shift manager at a burger joint. His mighty General reduced to essentially a housewife. The Hero now a telephone operator. Dealing with things like rent, a creepy landlady, and the giggles that come when they're super serious in public over things that aren't serious at all. It was funny the first few times. I had a sense of relief when the backstory elements would creep back in, but then the conflicts there were resolved so quickly, it made me wonder why I was worried in the first place. The positives here are some nifty fight scenes and some good art and effects to go with them. I did enjoy the handful of battles here. The in show music along with the opening and ending themes are nothing special, but hardly awful.  
The story itself was rushed, but the characters still got enough of a chance to grow on you. Enough to warrant concern when the final battle takes place, but the show ends on a note that makes it feel like it just stops rather than actually having an ending. This was rather awkward and frustrating. I had a few laughs with this show and as far as the Sub vs. Dub battle goes, it's a win for the Sub with a performance that stood a cut above the English dubbers. The show felt rushed, repetitive, and confused in content and tone. There was so much going on in the world the Devil and Hero came from, I wanted the show to go over there! That seemed much more interesting than watching Satan's General being sick all the time.  
At the end of the day, the goofiness itself does make the show decent enough and enjoyable in some spots, but operating on the premise of our main character being the evilest of evil and letting all the go because he's human now and somewhat likeable makes unpleasant contrast in my opinion, had they gone less dark and serious in his background, I may have enjoyed it more. But the contrast is too sharp for me to ignore and asks too much of me as a viewer to accept. Overall, I give this show a strong -/--. If you have nothing better to watch, check it out. Cheers!

it was good at the start we know from the title we're continuing from the first season it starts off like any other sequal with alot of confusion and questions to be answered.. more into the story the questions get answered but not fully and then it creates a big conflict and we all know conflict is good but when there is too much and everything is over dramatized you get tired.. also the characters i was very sad with this ciel and sebastian's personality changed drastically from the first season and not in a good way and the new characters didnt have that much of a background story and when they did give them one it wasn't good and didnt make sense.. lastly there was ALOT OF FANSERVICE!! im not complaining but the fanservice sort of took away from the story.. and then the ending was another negative factor but i'll eave that for you to decide.. anyway i liked some parts that were really exciting but the

Plot is a bit weak at times - and some of the twists are apparent - but it's mostly irrelevant in the face of developed characters and smoothly executed storyline. 
Doesn't take itself too seriously, genuinely amusing. 
In one (ponce laden) word, ""delightful"" 
Note: 
I can't personally empathise with some of the MC's circumstances, so it (unfairly) loses an overall point. (Current / former attractive female high-school seniors with multiple ladykiller male friends feel free to comment.) 
Doesn't stop it from being great, more of a personal taste thing.

Toradora is an emotional roller coaster never before have I seen an anime that made me care so much about the characters, im usually pretty cold and hard to reach but toradora broke down my walls. I could really sympathize whith taiga, since I had similar family issues. 
The beginning drags on without any real direction but after the first few episodes it really takes off, keep in mind that this is a drama so by take off I mean the feelings start flowing. 
The characters slowly grow on you people you thought you hated at the start will become people you actually care about. 
The ending was truly amazing one second you'll be extremely happy, and the next you'll feel like you've been punched in the gut, they diddnt leave lose ends so don't worry about that. 
The hardest part of any anime is figuring out where the ova fits in, the ova as usual with most animes, has almost nothing to do with the story but I'd suggest watching it after everyone gets back from the beach house I belive it fits best in that time frame cause before that the people involved wouldn't be that friendly and close to the end of the anime it doesn't fit at all. 
I highly reccomend Toradora for anyone that likes slice of life, drama, romance, or comedy genres.

This disgusting anime left me huddled in a corner. I felt corrupted, violated, and I knew I could ever eat boiled eggs ever again.  
If you like bondage, watersports, scat, bloodplay, rape and S&amp;M, then by all means, don't watch this. Honestly. You will lose your interest in any of these things because Nightshift Nurses makes you never want to have sex (or have anyone touch you for that matter) ever again.  
The art was incredibly good though, for a hentai. Good production values, and it shows. However, the characters weren't very good. Let's see, rapist and rape victims. Sounds like hentai to me, but does it make it a good anime? I think not. I can't say I enjoyed this. I was nearly to the point of tears; it's terrible and frightening. I know other hardy young men even cringed and felt like crying, so I was not alone. But the thing was like seeing someone get shot--you just can't look away.  
This is a scarring anime, and it does nothing but ravage your innocence and show you numerous unfabulous uses for an egg.

Garbage... Review ended :D 
To be honest i don't think there could be anyone who actually like this, it doesn't have story, a elementary school kid can make a better animation on a Nintendo DSi, the characters don't have any bparticular charisma, they are just three normal (and maybe very normal) girls how are losing hers time with friends (and I would rather lose time with friends myselft than watching this) and it doesn't bring anything interesting or at least any useful knowledge. The only reason I can imagin for someone to watch this thing to the end is just to add an anime to his or her list (Just like me)

I came home from work last night to find my room mate starting up ""Made in Abyss"" for a mutual friend. I decided to give it a shot based on his strong recommendation, and we ended up staying up all night watching the whole thing. After spending all day at work thinking about this anime, I decided that I very much wanted to write a review for those interested in watching it- and also to organize my own thoughts about it. 
DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT GO INTO ANY SPECIFIC PLOT DETAIL WHATSOEVER... THAT SAID, THIS REVIEW IS GEARED TOWARDS THOSE WHO WANT MORE INFO OF WHAT TO EXPECT AND IF IT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL APPRECIATE. FOR THAT REASON I DO GET PRETTY IN DEPTH ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE TONE AND OVERALL VIBE. 
Though I have rated this anime as a --/-- and have a strong desire to talk about it, a review should objectively help an undecided person figure out if the anime is worth their time; and while my thoughts on the show are largely positive, I also feel that a decent portion of viewers will not be won over. My hope is to give a fair review that will simultaneously express what I loved about this show and show what others may not love, all without spoiling the experience for those who do choose to go on this journey.  
I have a lot to say so I'll jump right into it. I will go a bit deeper into the idea of who will appreciate the anime in general in the overall review at the bottom. 
STORY: -/-- 
At its root ""Made in Abyss"" is about an adventure into an unknown world; and like many anime in this vein, the story itself is relatively simple. There are very straightforward goals the main characters want to to achieve and the actions they take to do this are what keep the ""adventure"" going. However, where a simplistic story like this can excel, as I believe this one does, is in the ""routes"" it takes towards the destination, so to speak. And in those details, I found a surprising amount of depth in this plot. 
As this story progresses, it layers more and more intrigue and mystery over the story. It is always hard to rate this particular aspect of a story when you don't have answers to all of these questions yet, but what is teased in this season shows real promise for some cool developments in the future. And along with showing that there is much more depth to what we understood in the beginning, the events and developments remain strangely unexpected throughout. Without spoilers, if you watch this one all the way through I can all but guarantee that you will see some things you would NOT have expected. This brings me to what I think will be a more divisive aspect of the story: the conflict and the way the tone is affected by it.  
While initial impressions of the character designs may indicate otherwise, this is a very ""adult"" show and it does not pull any punches. Some viewers will certainly think some of this tension is a bit over the top and occasionally even being cheaply crafted to evoke specific emotions from those watching. At times I think there is at least some basis for that argument; this anime seems to really want to drive those darker moments home and make them stand out... and they certainly do. I confess that once or twice I wondered if it was for the sake of the story or just to get a reaction out of us watching. 
Ultimately, while I had those occasional thoughts at times, those moments that seemed a bit ""in your face"" always did add a significant dynamic to the characters and plot in the long run. It also added a sense of real danger to the adventure and made the brighter moments that much brighter. Therefore, I am not personally of the opinion that the tension is ""cheap"". Some people do feel that way though, and if so that stuff is hard to overlook- and especially if you don't like be taken out of your comfort zone by a sudden moment of intensity, I can see this kind of thing diminishing your enjoyment. 
To leave off on less controversial part of the story, I would be remiss not to mention the world-building, especially when such a big part of the story is a ""journey"" of sorts... and let me just say it is masterful. As you see more of the world you not only get feel for the fantastic nature it posses but also the strange realism it has- which makes you feel like you as the viewer are discovering a new world. If I had any complaints about this it would be that I would have loved even more of that discovery. 
ART: --/-- 
How I feel about the art in this anime is very simple; it is breathtaking. When I first saw the character design, I sincerely did not expect for animation to be such a strong point in this show. The background and scenery, however, is some of my favorite imagery in any anime or animated media of any kind. As for that character design, though I didn't feel strongly about it at first, I was not off-put by the ""cuteness"" of the main characters to begin with. Because of this, I cannot speak for those who are off-put by this in their first impression (and I get it)... but I eventually went from ""no strong feelings"" to truly feeling that the character designs were perfect for the world surrounding them.  
But the animation truly goes above and beyond when it starts to cover new lands, characters, and themes. There are so many unique and interesting styles at play, and they weave together to capture perfectly what is going on both on the surface and also thematically what is going on much deeper. So many situations brought forth by the story allow the artists to go nuts stylistically, and the pay off is great. By the time I was deep into this anime, I felt like I was tapping directly into a very core part of the creator's sub-conscious; full of wonder, terror, and something truly personal. As corny as it sounds, art at it's best serves as filtered window into the artists soul, and the animation in ""Made in Abyss"" achieves this with unapologetic triumph. You may not always ""enjoy"" what you are seeing, but it was hard for me not to be constantly in awe of the talent and artistic expression behind it. 
SOUND: --/-- 
The soundtrack for this anime does what it needs to do and more. I enjoyed the OP and ED well enough, for sure, but where this soundtrack truly shines is it's ability to create background music that compliments the scenes flawlessly. The OST effortlessly guides your feelings through every scenario thrown at you- the fighting, the moments of beauty, and even the haunting scenes of fear: all of it evokes emotion from the viewer almost compulsively. 
The voice acting is another major strength here. There are a couple of very ""colorful"" characters with voice actors that show extreme talent in bringing these unique people to life. And when the show needs the characters to show any deep emotion, boy do the actors deliver. I don't want to spoil any specific scenes in the anime, but there were a few where I just had to marvel at how much more impact and emotion is brought into a scene when the emotion is so real. 
CHARACTERS: -/-- 
I've seen the sentiment that the characters are the weakest link in ""Made in Abyss"", and I can't exactly say that I don't understand this at all. However, I have a hard time calling it a ""weak link""... some of them are insanely well done. Even characters that only appear in a few episodes have so much depth to them. There are certain characters who I could write an entire review about. 
However, I honestly think that the two main characters are the reason that anyone thinks that this is a weak point of the anime. That is not to say that they are not well developed and compelling themselves- far from it. I think that this first part of the story just has a heavy focus on the will of these two characters and what is driving them, and that is a pretty straightforward element throughout. Not shallow by any means, and there is certainly plenty of character development for both- but this seems like it will be a moderately long story and I feel like a lot of the larger growth for them is still to come.  
One other minor critique I have in regards to those characters is that occasionally in the early parts of the anime I felt like relationship of the characters could have had more foundation, and that instead of showing why the characters felt the way they did the show just seemed to state it and move on. As I said, this was minor and not a consistent feeling, and also much less of an ""issue"" in the second half of the season. This makes me wonder if the source material gives a bit more insight into these relationships. 
At any rate, these are very minor issues. While there is certainly more room for depth in the future for a couple of characters, I don't want to give the impression that I find the show to be lacking in that area overall- I absolutely don't feel that way. Even very strong material can have room for improvement, especially when a story like this one is just getting started. 
ENJOYMENT: --/-- 
This was a very easy rating for me; I was transfixed throughout my entire viewing of this show. It was a very rewarding binge, as the story was smooth and did not at all feel ""episodic"" in nature. As you go deeper and deeper into the world presented, it really feels like a naturally expanding story rather than a show constantly trying to top the episode before it. Between that flow to the story, the animation and the world it all takes place in, there was not at any point a dull moment... for better or for worse. 
OVERALL: --/-- 
This was a masterpiece in my mind, and I felt like the anime was a --/-- before I had even finished it. Once we were well into the middle of the anime, there was an observation I made to my room mate: ""This show basically had a free pass on the plot"", I told him, ""with this animation and world-building the plot could go nowhere and I would still enjoy this immensely; instead, it's giving me all of that plus a story that is really making me think"". That statement still sums up how I feel. 
That is a big point I want to stress to those considering whether this anime is one to invest their time in... this is not a ""eat popcorn and zone out"" show. This anime may feature characters adventuring into a fantasy world, but this show will require far more out of the viewer than the typical ""fantasy/adventure"" genre that is so common these days. 
While there are many parallels and shows commonly compared to ""Made in Abyss"" (I frequently see Hunter X Hunter ----, Madoka Magica, and Shinsekai Yori), one that I'd mention is ""Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku"". If you are familiar with it, you will understand a bit better what I mean when I say that this is not a ""light watch"". The two anime are vastly different from one another in terms of style, vibe and most other factors, but both exist to challenge the viewer. Even if you don't think the show is done well, it is a wild ride in and of itself.  
It is definitely the type of show that will get insane out of nowhere and resonate with the viewer long after. In my experience that tends to make a show much more of a hit-or-miss... In a simple action anime or maybe a comedy, there can be so many factors that are sub-par but one can still enjoy it for what it is. But when a story strives for deeper meaning behind everything else, if that particular ""depth"" doesn't resonate with the viewer it is a bit harder to enjoy the rest of it. If you are often let down by an anime that wants to get very deep and sometimes very dark, there is a huge chance you may experience that same feeling with ""Made in Abyss"". 
This is also not for anyone who is unwilling to have an open mind and experience something ""challenging"". That is not to say you have to be very ""intelligent"" or be some insanely deep thinker to appreciate this anime... that's not the case. This kind of thing just isn't everyone's idea of entertainment. There is nothing wrong with a person having their own preference of what type of anime they like. I certainly wouldn't blame someone who just isn't looking for anything really heavy. And that's what this show is- heavy. 
However, if you are like me and usually respond well to a anime that takes a lot of risks and isn't afraid to go down it's own crazy path, I cannot stress enough how much I recommend you give this one a shot. Especially if you are a big fan of any of the anime I mentioned by name earlier, there is a big chance you are in for a treat. Even if it doesn't become an instant favorite like it did for me, if you are at all interested by what I'm describing you should try it out: you don't have to be crazy about it to appreciate how unique it is (and the sick animation) 
My personal impression of this anime after watching it, however, is that while it is generally rated very highly there are several very polarizing aspects to it. In these cases there is always going to be those who disagree with everything I've said. Even so, I hope I've provided enough insight in this review to help at least a few of you decide if this one is for you.

The male lead, Oria Ryoma, is a lazy lecherous pervert without an objective in his life and the IQ of an insect. He does however have one redeeming quality - he's a strong kick-boxer and knows how to protect women. As such, all the girls around him constantly feel the urge to jump on his manhood and suffocate him with their breasts. Not the most romantic of stories is it? Not at all, but such is the case with most hentai.  
The female cast is not worth mentioning at all. At times I was under the impression that the male lead was having sex with inflatable dolls rather than something that resembles characters. Moreover, everything is made extremely convenient because the girls apparently have no conscience and are absolutely fine with Oria banging everything in sight as long as they get their turn.  
Moving on to the art, it was well drawn and the style comparable to most of the overwhelmingly average hentai series. Likewise voice acting was decent however the constant low-bass run-of-the-mill porn music can easily get on your nerves after a while. If anything, I wish they would stop putting the same annoying melody in, you know which one it is I'm talking about, if you've seen your share of hentai you would have heard it about a million times by now.  
Overall, the story was far fetched, unrealistic and cheesy. The sex scenes themselves were somewhat satisfactory. Taking all things into account this series is average at best. Watchable without smashing your head against the keyboard but not something I'd personally recommend. If you're looking only for well drawn hanky-panky scenes then yes, if you want a decent story to go with it then no.

Introduction 
This anime at first, i thought it was just a regular anime that was just over hyped, i was drastically wrong. After a few episodes, i craved for it, like a addiction. This anime is a anime that you must fully understand if you want to get all of its story. You may want to watch this twice, or even more... because if you watch it a first time, and then a second time.. you question yourself saying... wow! i didn't know this... well yeah... if your going on a anime marathon, don't watch this... watch it slowly, and try to gain the understanding of the story... especially at the last -- episodes, you start asking what did that mean, what does this mean... anyways now to my specific reviews... 
Story 
The story was marvelous, DONT spoil yourself and read the spoilers!!! It slowly builds you up, and builds you (slowly of course), its never like.. oh wow and then another episode oh theres no story.. its like a FULL run of a video, and was never edited..well it felt like that... and then it brings you the greatest scenes... then it starts slowing down.. but its not a bad thing.. when it starts declining in intensive action, it brings a  huge TWIST... well it was a twist for me.. this whole anime has twists like no other... trust me.. the story is --/--!! 
Art 
The art was pretty good, they didn't go cheap and make crappy scenes... and art.. it was that spectacular like other animes... but since this is a more serious dark tone of a anime... the art was famulous! -/-- 
Sound 
Honestly, the sound for me just wasn't that amazing... it was like any other anime...  -/-- (fair ...not that bad.. it was decent) 
Character 
Woah, the characters in this anime are really, really good! They stay true to their role, and they don't become like a helpless character... if they are bad ass, they stay bad ass, if they are good, they stay good... the characters progress like the story... it has a good flow... it really is awesome.. i would have wrote more, but it would be huge spoilers... -/-- 
Enjoyment 
I enjoyed this anime, i plan to watch it a second time in a few years... It really is worth watching a couple of times.. i don't say this often either.. only a few -- can get on my (watch again) list... But i hoped there was more action, they prepared for it too... but too less.. i guess its because they wanted to provide you more story.. a rich story :)  ... -/-- 
Overall 
Well, this anime was quite long, and it was well worth it... i would highly suggest this anime to anyone who wants a serious type of anime that is a bit psycological.. and a bit more of a mature side... honestly there ins't much to say.. i know my review was quite short to others and not that clear.. but heres probably the best thing i've said in this review.. go watch the anime gogogoogo!

This anime could shock and astound you but the thing is it maybe funny. The scene that made me cry (in my opinion) is how the characters fight and how they sacrifice their own joy for someone else's joy. There are many quotes that you can get from the anime. The story is great and the art is somewhat good. The sound is quite nice. The characters may have their own specialties but there is a character there that I somewhat can't find him attractive (Takasu). Animes like this are very interesting. You will expect the unexpected. So i am inviting you to watch this anime for it is very different from the other animes that I've watched.

Osomatsu-san is the anniversary celebration of a --s show centered on six identical brothers and their friends, now grown up and living in a modernized world with the humor and animation upgraded to reflect their new age. The entire show consists of a bunch of skits centered on these characters either dealing with their shitty lives or reminding us that anime is awesome, and whilst some of the characters keep their old traits from back when their creator was alive, their personalities are mostly wildly different from what old-school fans might know of them. Karamatsu is now some wannabe ladies' man who wears tacky clothing and says lines that he thinks are way cooler than they actually are, Jyuushimatsu is now a hyperactive idiot who always seems to be on drugs, Ichimatsu is now a social recluse with a love of cats and, and Osomatsu is pretty much the same as he always was except with an addiction to playing pachinko and a desire to get laid. 
And you know what? It pretty much hits all the right notes when it comes to re-introducing old source material to a new audience in way that far outshines other similar projects like Yatterman Night or Young Black Jack. The show only makes token nods to the previous incarnations, and it's not like you need to see Iyami being the main character in the --s show to understand his frustration that he's not the lead in this one. The new modern visual style is energetic without overdoing it. And despite how similar the brothers look, it doesn't take too long to associate the names with the default expressions they usually have or remember the names in general. But most of all, it keeps to the spirit of its predecessor - mainly being a gag comedy - whilst understanding that humor in the --s just isn't the same as it is now. 
Having said that, the show can try a little too hard in regards to keeping up with what's cool. See, I know that people found the first episode where these --s anime icons were reimagined as Utapri-style BL characters to be one of the show's best highlights, but I don't understand what's supposed to be funny about parodies when the only joke is ""look at how anime we are. Aren't we cool?"" with the only twist being that they're not cool, especially when you repeat that joke five fucking times within two minutes. Even more grating when you call attention to it with that aggravating ""self-aware humor"" that's been ruining all anime and Western comedies under the sun. Did I mention this anime is directed by one of the Gintama dudes? Funny how that anime never gets sued for its blatant parodies like this show did. 
But whilst it's a gag show, Osomatsu-san will occasionally try to tug on the heartstrings by focusing on the characters' troubles regarding how modern society doesn't fit with their views or their desire to find romance. And it generally does this without losing its sense of humor. In fact, I'd say the humor improves during those segments because it's being used as a crutch to keep the drama from getting too heavy whilst being a core part of what makes it work. A good example is when Jyushimatsu gets himself a girlfriend who actually laughs at his lame jokes, which doesn't make them any less lame, but it makes sense that a girl who likes them would like him too. And it also makes it all the more heartbreaking when distance separates them. 
All in all, Osomatsu-san is an anime that deeply earns my respect in so many ways, mostly in its shedding of the old and embracing the new in a way that actually caused it to become one of the most popular anime of our time. It's aware what the audience of today wants, and it gives it to them without sacrificing the spirit of it predecessors and making sure that the finished production wasn't made solely as an obligation to fulfill the dead creator's anniversary. Which is why it breaks my heart to say that despite all it has going for it, I don't actually like Osomatsu-san. Why? Because it didn't make me laugh. Once. Which for a comedy show, is pretty much the equivalent of playing basketball with no hands or legs. 
Well okay, I'm exaggerating. I did laugh at that skit in the third episode where some guy who's basically a cross between Leatherface and Jigsaw has all the siblings tied up in an underground lair and tries to kill Osomatsu, only to keep mistaking his brothers for him to the point that after ten tries, he just goes ""fuck it"" and mutilates one of them off-screen? That was pretty solid. Everything else? The Mario Kart skit? The one where the sextuplets go trick-or-treating at Iyami's house and end up robbing him for some reason? Anything involving Totoko? At most, only a brief chuckle, which is admittedly an improvement over most anime comedies. 
The humor relies entirely on pop culture references, breaking the fourth wall, exaggerated faces that stopped being funny after the --s ended, yelling out the obvious, or just being weird for the sake of being weird, which are all bargain bin jokes that aren't worth the fifty cents you'd pay for at the dollar store. I'm not really sure what's supposed to be funny about Osomatsu failing to discover the source of the loud snoring in his room even after covering up his brothers' noses. Or that time when the sextuplets go trick-or-treating at Iyami's house and end up robbing him because...um...Halloween? And even that is ineptly handled since the director brought his comedic timing from Gintama into this thing, which means that even when a skit approaches being funny, it shoots itself in the foot by dragging itself out so long it ends up looking like a skeleton at the end rather than something with actual meat. 
This becomes particularly obnoxious in the show's second half, which have some of the worst cases of a joke outstaying their welcome I've ever seen. Water being replaced by lubricant in a Mad Max world? Kinda funny. The idol brothers making said dystopia a better place by pouring it all over their bodies for ten minutes? Um, it's just Utapri except in a Mad Max setting. What's supposed to be funny about that, and why are you making this joke go on so long when the only punchline is ""BL will save the desert""? Don't even get me started on the Girly-matsu skits. I'm pretty sure the only joke in those were the male voices coming out of genderbent versions of our leads. 
Osomatsu-san may have all the elements to create good laughs, but similar to when most stand-up comedians try to make it big in the movie world, something was lost in translation trying to string them all together, and I blame the lack of required energy on the fact that its setting is incredibly wacky as is, which lends itself some good heart when it wants to sell feelings, but doesn't allow for much irony when it comes to selling itself on the absurd humor that makes up the majority of the skits. I mean take Urusei Yatsura for example. Its humor runs on combining wacky with wacky and getting more wacky, but the reason it works is because it takes place in a fairly normal anime suburbia that just happens to get invaded by aliens and the military can just have their run of the place whenever some teenage girl gets upset that she can't go to school. Very rarely do the characters ever point out how strange it is that the folk hero Kintaro just happens to be flying around amongst the common folk, participating in kindergarten activities and swinging axes at folks with horns on their heads, or that Wendy from Peter Pan can come out of a library book and bring a bunch of other literary characters to shatter the ""please be quiet in the library"" rule into pieces. And my god is that show not funny when it tries to be ""special"" (fuck you periodical episodes). 
I will say this: the final episode with the baseball match that basically resembled that one episode of Samurai Champloo combined with Space Jam was alright. Otherwise, the only other thing I can praise Osomatsu-san for are its opening and ending themes, both on a visual and sound level. Granted, the second one is generic J-pop, but something about it feels kind of triumphant. And it has every right to be triumphant. Over twenty-thousand Blu-ray sales for each volume, man!

Sword Art Online: The Chinese Years 
LA had been REALLY skeptical with China getting into the fray with anime, with such anime like Bloodivores, but this anime by all means gave LA a bit of leverage in showing that China can produce anime AND well at that.  
Quanzhi Gaoshou though LA joked that it's like Sword Art Online, well not really, it's not even looking at the daily lives of e-sports which gave itself off in the first episode. No this follows an e-sports player by the name of Ye Xiu voiced by Zhang Jie who is to retire, be it from his manager...he does BUT he gathers a rag tag random players in a new server and to hone their skills BUT to also troll the professional teams he retired from.  
So that's the setting and on the outset, it is intriguing, let alone an anime that actually looks at MMORPG both in PVP and PVE as well as the professional circuit of such an MMO. Quanzhi Gaoshou does come with a few caveats, good and bad though. 
So let's get to that. 
On the good, well it's mainly towards the characters, be it protagonists, allies or antagonists and how they work in the MMO of ""Glory"". Ye Xiu the main protagonist is the trolling retired pro player but he has this stoic charm to him and sometimes his goals is disguised very well before the antagonists realized...""that they f***ed up"". Next is Tang Rou voiced by Qiao Shiyu who is an aggressive gamer and loves competitions and because of Ye Xiu beating her, she begins playing the game and is something of a newbie look into the game and to be honest was LA's favourite character in the anime because of it. Su Mucheng voiced by Tong Xinzhu is a pro player like Ye Xiu and is something of a childhood friend as they both started playing Glory during beta and inadvertently is the reason why Ye Xiu retired (not maliciously of course) and she's might as well be the Asuna to Ye Xiu's Kirito, she however becomes a satellite character for a good chunk of the anime. The antagonists are the expected assholes and narcissistic players wanting to get an edge on Ye Xiu and will try to destroy him, such like Liu Hao voiced by Zhao Yi being the worst of it, while Wang Jiexi voiced by Wei Chao just wants to know whats up with Ye Xiu's latest avatar. he thing is alot of the professional teams underlings becomes students to Ye Xiu so they can get better in the game EVEN THOUGH THEIR PRO'S!. As much as the characters ""development"" are mainly focused on the character's players avatar and bettering themselves in the game, it's still development, be it from Tang Rou's being the newbie but even rivaling a pro in APM, just her needing to hone her timing and skills to Huang Shaotian voiced by Ye Qing being a very good player as the ""Sword Saint"" but he's an annoying trash talker and Qiao Yifan voiced by Su Shangqing a reserve player using an assassin class but Ye Xiu gives him advice in thinking of changing his class to better help his playstyle.  
Quanzhi Gaoshou does make some good focus on the game as the game is really where the anime is set in (as well as the internet cafe Ye Xiu works at but same difference) and as a result the game does make it feel like an MMORPG with both PVP and PVE elements to it, sure the slang of MMO's are there and thrown out there but aside from Ye Xiu's OP combos yeah the game makes it look like an MMO in anime form. 
And the bad, well LA mentioned it but the enjoyment of the anime mostly hinges towards how you feel about Ye Xiu and his almost superpowered ability in playing the game, yes the anime DOES try to explain it off, like his crazy godly combos as since he's an unspecialized class with his class able to do tons of combo potential but all somewhat weak, but Ye Xiu ale to pull his flaw into a strength as he uses his weak combos by chaining those combos continuously and his own self made weapon able to save his glass cannon combo-ing status at that, but yeah...if that didn't help explain it, Ye Xiu might as well as be Kirito from Sword Art Online with God Mode attached, though to counterpoint this statement, Ye Xiu though OP, he allows his teammates to function together alongside him (be it if their low level or unskilled or not) and his beliefs seems to veer to his playstyle unlike Season - Kirito. The only other thing is that most of the characters who has beef with Ye Xiu (mainly the professional leaders) are base ""antagonist"" bad, this especially from Liu Hao and Sun Xiang. Lastly is that...Quanzhi Gaoshou does feel a bit rushed in many ways, mainly in the pacing and the pacing the majority of the anime being FAST as one thing happens the another with many of the plotlines finishing in one episode that focused on one character (this excludes anything to do with Ye Xiu and his trolling of the professional team that made him retire as that's more of an ongoing plotline throughout the anime). 
Now the animation done by G.CMay Animation & Film is actually quite well handled in all respects, from the decent character designs in both real life character and Glory counterparts though some of the characters designs did look similar and LA nearly mistook one character for another. The battles are nicely animated much like the pacing of the anime, is pretty fast yet fluid in all respects. Finally the backgrounding was gorgeous at times this especially inside the game and yes the battles counts. G.CMay Animation & Film did a damn fine job in the animation department and it CLEARLY shows. 
So uhhh if LA listing the characters with Chinese voice actors didn't tip you off, yeah Quanzhi Gaoshou is ALL Chinese, now LA COULD complain because ""it not Japanese!??!!"" but LA found this to be a new experience but LA won't complain, Instead LA will say that much like LA's Elsword anime review about Korean voice acting , well the Chinese sounds alot more aggressive and the hardest thing to keep up with...is that they talk too damn fast for LA to keep up with the subtitles. But in a way makes the characters voice acting to sound..LA doesn't know..""local"" as Chinese DO sound aggressive when they don't but also speak fast as hell. As such Korean voice actors seem to pander towards the kids in their ""kid show"" vocals, The Chinese try to sound local by being aggressive and quick in their cadences and Japanese voice acting seem to be in on the other side of the spectrum of the Koreans, being professional about it with a wide variety of cadences with some silliness here and there BUT their cadences isn't how Japanese ""talk like""...this has been LA in Voice acting cadences in China, Korea and Japan and this was LA's TedTalk. But long and short of Quanzhi Gaoshou's voice cast, yeah decent, but LA can't say much as this was a new experience in watching a Chinese dub. 
Quanzhi Gaoshou was something of a breathe of fresh air in Chinese anime media, as LA been watching bad, sometimes nonsensical animes from them *cough* Bloodivores *cough*, yes Ye Xiu as a character is the clutch on whether you're gonna like the anime due to his OP powers and almost always winning along with the overall fast pacing and LA's hardest thing to get used to..the Chinese audio BUT even then, Quanzhi Gaoshou was a nice take on an MMORPG anime but blending both PVP and PVE and given focus on it through it's character players as well as a glimpse into the e-sports in the eyes of China's MMORPG fans, not to mention how the anime likes to develop it's minor characters oddly enough and Quanzhi Gaoshou was quite the fast yet decent ride with a few bumps here and there but still made it all the way to the finish line without LA getting annoyed.  
Onwards to Glory's summit Ye Xiu!.....through his trolling!

I know this might sound exaggerated — “-/--? Are you insane?” — but please just hear me out for a second... 
Spoilers ahead: 
Protecting people in the face of adversity; even in the means of sacrificing yourself, using unique strength only found in the hearts of some people for good, being brave and standing up for the people you love… this is what it means to be a hero. A hero isn’t something you strive to be, nor is it something to be viewed as a career. To be qualified as a hero in the first place, is to be selfless. By devoting all your life trying to become a hero by wearing a cape and a superhero outfit made by plastic is, in and of itself, a selfish and childish dream. By dreaming so only results in a messiah complex.  
To be running around and jumping from building to building wearing goofy clothes only defeats the purpose of being a hero. Only people who are looking for attention do this; narcissism at its best.  
Having a girl wear a suit that reveals most of her cleavage, and a skirt so short to the point where it should be called a belt, only makes me wonder why she didn’t become a prostitutional entertainer instead. And also having a character wearing a cape whilst stepping on the bad guy they just beat up whilst laughing like a maniac and shouting, “Don’t worry, your savior’s here.” only makes me wonder why he didn’t become an exhibitionist.  
Every character in My Hero Academia only have a single goal in mind: to become a hero that everyone looks up to. That’s really it. There’s no other character in the series that has a different ambition — even if they do have a bit of a different ambition, it’s still completely connected to being an admirable hero. Being a show about heroes, it’s okay for everyone wishing to become a hero. But if that’s the only primary goal in their mind, then that’s just a writing excuse — all of these characters have a goal, thus, all of these characters are three-dimensional — or so the author thinks. The characters are like a group of Flamingos who have chain reactions. If you can’t handle writing a very large cast of characters — especially by trying to flesh out all of them — then don’t try to do it in the first place.  
Characters are indeed hard to write. It’s definitely okay to have a large cast of characters, but do so at your own risk. The writer, in this case, tried to give some personality to other side characters. But what resulted in was underdevelopment of main characters — not to mention failing at even making the side characters decent.  
Deku is the underdog of the world. He’s also shy and not so good socializing with girls; in other word, he is us. This isn’t supposed to be an ecchi-harem show, Kohei Horikoshi.  
Trying to make us experience everything through Deku’s body only admits that he’s flat as a character. Normally, we’re supposed to put ourselves in the protagonist’s shoes, but to actually become the protagonist is lazy writing. This is just an excuse trying to make the character “relatable”. A character can still be flat even if they have an ambition, backstory, and development. Because execution is what matters.  
Deku’s ambition and backstory are quite simple. He wants to be a hero like All Might, but he doesn’t have a quirk, unlike most people. He then gains powers from All Might by eating a single piece of his hair. This is all fine and all, but what about his development? He pretty much stays the same and has the same mentality throughout the whole two seasons. Being stronger and being able to control your powers better isn’t character development. What Kohei Horikoshi tries to do is make Deku break his bones over and over again just for the sake of looking “cool”. And then he breaks more bones in the second season, which tricks you into thinking that he developed as a character. But he has the same ideology and personality intact; only being able to control his powers, or rather All Might’s powers better.  
I doubt the possibility that Deku will ever improve as a character throughout the whole show; he’ll stay the same; crying, speaking, thinking, and acting the same exact way he did at the start. The reason is simple: there is no room for improvement. Deku is, at first, actually what he should have developed into, not start with it. Only if he develops into an evil character — developing an ideology about heroes the opposite of the one he had before — can he be able to improve, or develop as a character. But the spoiler which Deku gave us at the beginning, and also looking at the genre of this show, there’s zero percent possibility. Having better powers, or controlling a power better, or creating your own proper power is often confused with character development. But it’s not. 
Deku is known as a rare protagonist because he’s smart and analytical. But he’s stereotypically so. Putting your hand on your chin and thinking aloud while having words flying out of your head isn’t identified as being smart; it’s just an attempt at being one. It’s very easy to make other characters point at him calling him “smart”, when in reality, he’s only slightly above average. He actually reminds me of Sakamoto from Sakamoto desu ga — due to the fact that every character looks up to him, for the exception of some characters who hate him and want to surpass him, but end up giving up and acknowledging the main character’s superiority. But let’s not forget that Sakamoto was loved due to him being cool, meanwhile, Deku is liked for no justified reason whatsoever. Sure, he is strong. But don’t forget that he was a loser who was being bullied at first and viewed negatively by almost everyone. So there’s no way people’s view on him would change in such a short span of time just because he got stronger.  
What about the girl he saved once which automatically made them very close friends — Uraraka? She’s very poorly written. She reminds me of Tenten from Naruto when she kissed Neji’s ass in the Chunin exam. Her main purpose is to be cute and support the main character. She shouldn’t be one of the main characters of the show, especially considering how weak her character arc was. Her backstory is basically having bad family circumstances, so she wants to become a “hero” for financial gain. She has about two or three personality traits. And that’s it. I can’t help but think that this show would’ve been fine without having her even appear in the show. There’s nothing to add on to her character because I feel like she’s even more underdeveloped than other side characters.  
Avenger stories are, at best, fine. Iida’s whole drama about avenging his brother was executed poorly, and was extended way longer than it should have. The best way to realize if a character is three-dimensional and has depth, is to have the character pursue a certain motivation, but doesn’t see the need in explaining his or her actions to other people. Iida’s long monologue explained all of his motivations to Stain; his enemy. This is the best example of how you should be showing instead of telling. If a story tries to flesh out their characters by having them tell their ideology, instead of showing their ideology through their actions just shows the lack of the author’s writing ability to do so. Iida’s motivation is in and of itself fine, just done very poorly.  
Another example of a fine character with a fine backstory, yet terrible execution — Todoroki’s whole character development is eventually decided by mister psychiatrist, Deku. Todoroki is a decent character, but was very inconsistent throughout the whole show. His personality changed through dialogue — meaning that he’s Todoroki in one scene, but a totally different person in another. His ideology, personality and perspective change in a very short amount of time, making him inconsistent. He started as a very promising character, but is slowly evolving into another one of Boku no Hero’s ordinary characters.  
If you can remove a particular character from a story and can still have the story function as well as it did before means that the character should either not be there entirely, or write them differently so that he/she has a purpose in the story. If the author of Boku no Hero did this, then he would be left with a total of four-five characters that can actually function as an independent character. For a show praised by the way it handles its characters very well, it’s actually very subpar when it comes to characters.  
The author wrote a character for the sole reason of being hated — Minoru Mineta, the pervert. Why? Was this used so that we hate a character so much that other characters feel like decent people compared to him? There is no doubt that the author wrote this character this way intentionally. Was he expecting people to like him? I doubt it, hence why I think my reasoning is correct. If the author himself doesn’t care about his own characters then why should we? 
The characters in Boku no Hero remind me of IDubbbz; dressing in a very weird costume, and dancing around here and there, shouting, “I wannabe gay!” — If this analogy isn’t true, then I don’t know what is.  
If the writer is eagerly trying to make me like the characters by using very cheap techniques, then I might as well admit the absurd fact that my, and also many other people’s emotions are being toyed by. I don’t see any positivity from this show — if the character’s are merely “simple”, then why use tricks such as melodramatic character arcs to further our bond with the characters? Doesn’t this contradict the simplicity of the characters? 
The characters’ existence is for a sole reason: comedy. Whenever a comedic scene comes by — which is very frequent — I’m reminded of Black Clover because of the amount of screeching thrown at the screen. Characters are eventually used as a remark-factory in this case, as in remarks are the only things side characters ever say. Not only does this make for very cheesy comedy, but it also confuses my emotions. This show is ultimately a comedy, so when a serious and “emotional” moment comes up, I laugh, wondering why the characters are all of a sudden taking everything seriously. I’ve laughed more at sad and emotional scenes than I did in the actual comedy scenes.  
When Deku finds out that he doesn’t have a quirk and goes home and plays the video about All Might on his computer, I was smiling, because that’s what this show wants me to do, right? I mean, look at Deku’s crying face. He’s crying with a hysterical smile. I automatically take this as the show trying to tell me not to take this seriously. If the show wanted me to take it seriously, then why have him smile instead of frown? I know a lot of people try to hide their actual emotions by smiling, but kids are straightforward with their emotions.  
Uraraka’s character arc wasn’t supposed to be emotional at all, yet they somehow tried to make it emotional. Same with Momo losing her confidence. As I came upon this particular episode, I tried to watch the previous episode thinking that there was something I missed. But there was nothing. I was very confused as to why she’s even acting like that. It was apparently because she lost her battle in the tournament, but they went way over the top with her drama. The show can’t draw a clear line between comedy and drama. E.g. Showing a character’s breasts in the middle of a “horrifying” battle, Mineta gripping another character’s breasts while another character is on the verge of death, etc… And so when I come upon these overdramatic scenes, I no longer care what happens to the characters, since you can’t take something seriously when it doesn’t even care to take itself seriously to begin with.  
People like to point fingers at other shows like Anohana and Kiznaiver and call them overdramatic. Yet Boku no Hero has as much, if not twice as much overdramatic events — a shounen having more drama than some other slice of life-drama show is very weird. What part of Boku no Hero is overdramatic, exactly? All of it, probably. As I said before, this anime is a comedy; a pure one in that matter. So when the show throws in these overdramatic emotional moments, I laugh off — not considering the possibility that the characters are on the verge of dying.  
Since we’re talking about death, let’s talk about plot armour. I’ve heard many times from many people comparing Boku no Hero with Naruto, calling it superior. Even though Naruto had immense amount of plot armour with its main characters, Boku no Hero goes beyond the limit as to give every single character in the series plot armour. Plot armour is okay as long as it has the right amount of it. 
Naruto is tragic, and had a lot of characters die. Meanwhile, Boku no Hero is a very carefree and a childish series. The kids were beating up the villians in ease. It’s like they’re so experienced in their first try. None of them even had any major injuries. If Naruto was Boku no Hero Academia, then Naruto would’ve become Hokage in episode four.  
I would’ve fallen in love with Boku no Hero Academia had I been an eight year old, because that’s what children want: a fun series about heroes saving the day, which has no development or tragedy; something you watch on Saturday mornings.  
I’ve got nothing against simplistic shows. In fact, I love a lot of shows which are very simplistic, and in some cases, generic. But that’s not how I view Boku no Hero; rather than finding it simplistic, I thought of it as bland and subpar.  
Boku no Hero Academia isn’t generic. It’s actually subpar. This show is praised for having simple characters. But that’s my down point, because they aren’t even simple; they are so much simpler than simple. They are flat cardboard characters that are very hard to connect to. To begin with, one of the most important point of a story is to connect with the characters. Sure, there are shows and stories I’ve enjoyed and loved without liking the characters, but the possibility of that happening could be because of the superb storytelling. Does Boku no Hero Academia have that? No. The story is, at best, average. The world building is underexplored (Using my knowledge upon completing the first two seasons).  
At the very least, I remember the names of about four or five characters from the series. As for other characters, I don’t even remember them in general, let alone their names. As I said before, the characters are dealt with simultaneously; like a chain reaction. Making all of them have the same personality traits and reactions to particular events. They speak, eat, fight, and react in the exact same way. E.g. when everyone in the class talks simultaneously.  
The characters don’t each stand on their own because they aren’t even a fully fleshed out character to begin with. Characters are indeed the weakest part of the series — but the ideology is not only poor, but horrible.  
Back to heroism, I don’t like the way heroes are viewed and treated in Boku no Hero Academia. Some of the most memorable heroes of anime aren’t characters that wear capes and acknowledge their heroicness, they’re rather the complete opposite. Okabe from Steins;Gate is, in my opinion, the most memorable hero of all anime. He went through more than a thousand wordlines, experiencing so much adversity, pain, and death just to save his friends. This is what it truly means to be a hero. (Not shounen, but still profits my point) Never did Okabe say, “This is a story of how I became the greatest hero of all time.” Admitting your own heroicness, no matter how good of a hero you are, defeats your title as a hero.  
I can also say the name of a lot of characters from other series that can absurdly be considered better heroes than the characters of Boku no Hero ever were.  
Put any hero in Boku no Hero in a situation where they have to choose between two options — those options being: Would you rather save humanity from a disaster that could potentially kill billions of people, but be considered evil by everyone, or save a single person, but be considered the greatest hero of all time; being admired all over the world, forever — most, if not all characters would definitely choose the second option. Basically, it’s Boku no Pride Academia, not Boku no Hero.  
Now ideology aside, the underlying issue of this series is that, I don’t see this anime going anywhere. I don’t see any meaning for its existence. At the beginning, Deku says, “This is a story of how I became the greatest hero.” I, and many other people, know that the main character is going to be the best; prevailing over any other character in the series. But we still have a feeling of uncertainty at times. Deku confessing the future on screen, in the very beginning frame of the first episode, just removes the whole point of this show. At the very least, I wanted to experience the journey that Deku went through without knowing what’s to come in the future. There’s no point in watching this series anymore because I’ve basically watched the whole show now. And the problems of Deku’s character, as I talked about before, removes the potential of me caring for his journey. 
I despise this show in all of its being. There’s a barricade wall between me and the characters; distancing us from each other and preventing any further connection other than merely knowing two bland personality traits of each character. Additionally, the thought of having my emotions toyed with by cheap tricks makes me feel disgust, combined with the fact that the second season was two-cour even though there wasn’t any strong necessity; not to mention how the dullness of the show made it feel like a sixty-four episode series.  
The only thing preventing me from rating it a one out of ten is the superb visuals by Studio Bones. I respect this show as a piece of art, but no more fabric of the show do I admire.  
I’m open to any criticism I’d get upon closing this review off saying this is one of my least favorite show of all time.

This anime is simply amazing, I thought that Your Lie in April would be the best anime I would see but this anime blows it out of the water. (See what I did there?) 
===Story=== 
Now I gave the story a - for the fact that it was not the main driving force (by story I mean the whole sea god being angry and wanting to destroy the surface) while, yes, it was a big part I feel like the characters where a bigger driving force. Now one but I didn't like was how it ended with uncertainty but at the same time that is a positive, I mean, of it ended with a ""they lived happily ever after"" I would've thought that would be worse than how it ended. 
I'm not to bring up YLiA very often but I have one gripe with YLiA which is the lie (don't worry I won't into spoiler territory) which was in my opinion unreasonable, like, I know that lie was the driving force behind the story but I still feel it was unreasonable, but with this anime I only have a semi-gripe (a gripe which was the best way to handle it.) 
===Art=== 
I may never have been to Japan but I can still appreciate how detailed the Art is especially on the backgrounds where the details are breathtaking, it shows little details that you see in real life but nearly never in animation. The character animation is good and they don't stand out from the background, the eyes on the people from the sea (I just realised I never summarised the plot... Ehh it has a summary up above) look a little weird but it does make them stand out from the surface people, if only slightly. 
===Sound=== 
I have never heard/seen an anime where the sound was terrible while I can't judge the Japanese voice actors amd I haven't heard the dub the sound of the sea,cars and basically everything besides the voices is easily a --. 
===Characters=== 
As mentioned in the story section the characters seem to drive the characters to do what they do more then the actual plot, all the characters have their own personality and they feel real, I can imagine this characters as real people and they grow, especially the main character which is probably because he got the most screen time, and the love... Mess, I heard someone say that if you tried to draw a chart showing who loved who there would be too many arrows, which, to me, makes the characters feel real because you may love someone who someone else also loves and it won't be a clear, this person loves this person, in real life it would be a mess, at least I think that's what it would be like, I don't know because I have never experienced a relationship or even love, only childish crushs. For the characters I give this a -- 
===Enjoyment=== 
Overall I enjoyed this anime, and there were a couple of twists I wasn't expecting which made this series really fun to watch, so again this was a -- to me. 
===Overall===  
this kinda ties into Enjoyment because this is a --, and I honestly say check it out, if I gave scores like Glass Reflection I would give this a Certified Frosty. So check it out, I'm sure you'll love it like I did.

OK this is my -st review so it's going to be really short,so let's get started. 
Right so you may have looked at the season anime list this year and saw this particular one and though to yourself 'hey cute girls wearing sexy Armour that's pointless cause almost --% of the body is bare but the sword their holding is awesome' right? So you  wait for the -st to debut. 
So you watch the -st episode and if you can tell a crappy anime by from just watching the -st - minutes like me, you high expectations are dropped really low. Basically what you got is Gundam meet's magical girls....or so you thought. What really get's under my skin about this anime is that not that's it cliche, but the singing while their fighting. SO instead of Gundam meet;s magical girls, you get K-On meet's Infinte Stratos with a dash of Mega Man Starforce -. 
Story--- Aliens or some mystical being's called noise (rip off from Mega Man Star force) randomly kill people for no reason and the only way to defend yourself against these monsters is sing, have faith and armor will randomly manifest from your body -.o. 
Art--- as always the seasonl anime art is very good and i was impressed :).  BUT! that's the only thing good about this anime and that's not even much. 
Sound--- sounds like wanting to shove a fork through my eardrums. The singing while fighting is probably the reason why i dropped this (no seriously the have to sing to power up....) 
Character--- cliche female protagonist, nothing special, not even bothering. 
Enjoyment--- pathetic, i tried my best to enjoy this piece of crap but couldn't. 
So yeah, this anime at the very least is not what your going to expect period. Whether if ou expected to be good or bad. But when you try to mix moe and action, will singing and fighting you get a epic fail. Dont watch this.... unless your horny.

Story: 
Honestly, a lot better than I expected. While it totally wasn't my thing, at first, I enjoyed the transition into a more serious story. It becomes a little too serious for itself in the end, but still, I was attentive and that's all that matters. 
The narrative is strictly about Aoki and Rin as the two are definitely the more fleshed out characters. It dabbles a little into Reiji's history (who is Rin's older brother) but it still remains primarily about the strange relationship that Aoki and Rin have. 
While aggressive and offensive, the story finds a good balance between unnecessary fanservice and compelling storytelling. Aoki's stress over being a young teacher while also having to deal with very confused students, Rin and her posse, makes for a relatable story arc of someone who is new to their job and at risk of losing it. Of course, the show takes liberties to use this for fanservice, but it still balances a way to make it a very serious risk and something that isn't necessarily glorified. 
Rin's arc is also quite interesting as we get to watch someone who at first seems unrealistically sexually frustrated but is merely misplacing the love she feels for a parental figure with the sort of intimate love you show one's partner. While it's definitely abused for the sake of fanservice, I found it to be a very interesting watch despite that fact. 
Since the show is mostly episodic, the narrative finds itself to be boring and stunted. Like most shows like this, the last - or so episodes find themselves following their own closed arc. That's when things get a little ridiculous, and the tone changes to one that probably would have made the story much more believable and compelling. The error is that these two tones - the one from the beginning and the one from the end - do not compliment each other. It's like watching two different stories unfold. 
Art: 
Everyone looks like they are a stage back on the evolutionary scale. This may be close to the original character designs, but it's stupid and I can't help but laugh every time I become conscious of it. 
The show mostly takes place in a school. At this point, I shouldn't have to explain why this is a negative. It's boring, uninspiring, and there's very little you can do when setting up decent scenes when everything under the sun has been used in a school setting at this point. 
When there are scenes not in the school, they're devoid of life and of little interest. Completely forgettable. 
Sound: 
Some of the songs were okay (NOTE: Okay is rated below 'kinda good'). I don't remember anything specific, but I do believe there was one song that I found quite good. Only one, and it wasn't used much. 
VA work is good. That's to be expected from an industry that pays their VA's higher than anyone else. I wasn't wowed by anyone's performance, and there isn't anything unique within this work that demands VA's go above and beyond, so it feels like this is the kind of show where the Voice Actor's (and sound coordinators) merely jumped on the project because they needed pocket change and everything else was booked. 
Character: 
Again, while unfortunately cluttered by unnecessary fanservice, a weak soundtrack, and bare-minimum VA work, I felt the arcs that Aoki and Rin had, both separately and in unison, were very good. Had the show limited itself to them, or even limited itself to less than - episodes, or even gone so far as to release as a -- minute OVA, then the story could have omitted all of the useless stuff beyond their character arcs and have been much better. 
Enjoyment: 
It's unfortunate that I restrict myself from suggesting this anime solely because of the unnecessary fanservice. ""Well why did you watch it if not for the fanservice?"" you may ask. I watched it because of morbid curiosity. It's the sort of thing where you curiously look at a car accident knowing that you may see a dead body but you do it anyway because you've never actually SEEN a dead body. The difference here is that this anime is a car wreck, sure, but everyone lived and the only losses are material. It's an event that you wish didn't happen, but something good still came from it. 
((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!))

This OVA is an absolute masterpiece. I usually don't write reviews of series, but I just had to recommend it to somebody. It is also a land of many ""firsts"". It's the first Gundam series not directed by Tomino. It's the first Gundam OVA. It's also the first extended view we have of what life in the colonies is like as well as the first story from the perspective of civilians. It absolutely nails everything it's trying to be 
The story is outstanding, both from a critic's perspective and the way it fits in with the rest of the Universal Century timeline. It makes the world of Gundam feel ""real"" more so than -- episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam or -- of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam ever did. 
The art and animation are beautiful, as is expected from an OVA of a popular series like Gundam. There's not really much to write about beyond the attention to detail. The cigarettes are realistically animated and so are the liquids. The best part of this OVA's artwork has to be the portions set in space. They are absolutely beautiful, and even better than Zeta Gundam's backgrounds. 
The soundtrack is pretty good, but it's nothing to write home about. The main theme is really the best part. It captures the sad atmosphere of this OVA really well. 
The characters are amazing. I really like the character of Chris and wish we could see more of her. The tragedy of the OVA is really well-driven 
I really enjoyed this OVA. To quote Zeta Gundam ""You will see the tears of time""

I don't have much to say about this short series one way or another. This isn't due to a lack of trying, I just have a hard time pinning down how much I enjoyed the show. The characters are very simple, and the ""plot"" is straightforward. The protagonist is self-conscious about her drinking, thus she only drinks around her husband at home who is a former bartender. 
The main couple were the only ones with any real development, but each episode seemed to mostly boil down to the drink served for a particular mood the protagonist was feeling. The show was admittedly pretty cute, however I kept wondering for what reason I was going forward. There wasn't anything poor about the animation, art, or sounds, however the series doesn't have a lot of depth. The first episodes feel largely the same as the last, and when I compare that to something like Akkun no Kanojo (currently airing as of this review), I can't help but feeling I wanted more out of the show. 
Regardless, if you're looking for a show you can knock out in an afternoon with some cute characters, interesting drinks, and you don't mind a bit of mediocrity: it can fill your spot of extra anime you've been meaning to get to.

I watched the series nearly a year ago after reading rave reviews. This was my first P.A. Works anime, and I came in with high-ish expectations that were crushed both quickly and dismally. 
Some spoilers ahead. 
Story / World-building (-/--): 
By and large, the biggest disappointment. Let's start with the world-building: the concept of Nagi no Asukara was definitely intriguing; an underwater community directly adjacent but socially barred from mainland community. Naturally, this opens an opportunity for great world-building and a chance to see a unique take on unfamiliar territory. 
Unfortunately, nothing is really unfamiliar. The underwater community of Shioshishio almost has no difference with the land world. It is literally a regular human town - just underwater. The residents have no fishy traits and look like normal land people - just underwater. After a while, it really seems that the only other marker constantly reminding you that Shioshishio is ""different"" is the constant narrated callback to imposed social barriers.  
Next, the plot. The chosen heroes are young children from both Shioshishio and land world. Their fates are tied to the ancient origins of their homes. Normally, this can make for a compelling plot, but the way the series inputted typical slice-of-life with homespun myth and magic just...wasn't satisfying. If anything, I found it melodramatic and at times senseless. The ""impending doom"" scenario loses its edge. The twists and turns in the plot are presented in a predictable manner; at times, they even seem overly convenient (the end of the first arc and the beginning of second arc was particularly unappealing, even a little confusing). How things ""work out"" is even more lackluster. 
Another major downfall was the **heavy** emphasis on the romantic notions all throughout the series. Never mind the fact that these are children in puberty - the series' take on romance is, in a word, absolutely infuriating. The standard average of the love triangle takes on more dimensions as it turns out everyone in the hero-group has feelings for, you guessed it, the person that doesn't seem romantically interested in him/her. As you observe how the ""romantic gestures"" are carried out, you might, like me, become angrier at how incredibly shallow, hackneyed, or annoying many of them are. This will be explained more in the ""character"" section. 
All in all, story had great potential, but was not carried out in a way that shows the same level of promise as its concept. 
Art (-/--): 
The visuals are wonderful. The landscapes and environments glitter and glow. Character visuals are fine and animation is great. P.A. Works seems to have a trend in producing fantastic art.  
Sound (-/--): 
Fantastic; the soundtrack is my favorite part of the series and its variety is wonderful. You should definitely give the OST a listen even if you choose not to watch the series. 
Character (---/--): 
Whew, okay. This is where most of my upset with the series comes from. Usually, when I watch any anime, there is at least **one** character that I genuinely like or can at least empathize with. Unfortunately, I did not find myself feeling this connection with ANY character in Nagi-Asu.  
Each of the protagonists just has some deep flaw that seriously mess with how they interact with each other. Hikari loves Manaka but is in crucial need of anger management classes along with an ego-relief. Manaka is clumsy, silly, frail - another damsel in distress type with nothing much to offer. Kaname is kind and keeps his feelings to himself, which apparently gives him the boot in terms of romantic pursuit. Chisaki is annoying and desperate and her priorities are not well-placed. Tsumugu is a silent and stoic rock which automatically means he must catch the feelings of some foolish girl. 
I supported no one in their romances because of how the set romantic pairs interacted with each other. The depths of their innocent friendship is bludgeoned by the frantic pressure of hormonal interests and consistent indecision - while this may be acceptable in some romance anime, it was plainly frustrating to see it played out by the Nagi-Asu characters. Yes, feelings can be confusing, but my goodness they do not have to be as complicated as they appear in Nagi-Asu.  
Miuna and Sayu are no different. They first showed up as younger, bitter brats and, by stroke of narrative magic, are shown in the -nd season at the same age as their respective romantic interests. How wonderfully convenient that time worked in their favor - by progressing for the two girls, and stopping for their boy crushes. Their antics in the -nd season are unremarkable. Miuna especially felt like a wrench thrown into the love polygon; I disliked her the most because she received so much emphasis as a ""side-liner"" that you're supposed to sympathize with. I did not at all. 
All in all, characters felt one-dimensional and none of them had appealing personalities. No character was really fleshed out in a way that made me appreciate them on a real level. For the most part, their unwavering annoying behavior was all that I saw in them. 
Enjoyment (-/--): 
I watched the whole series out of both a sense of duty and deep frustration. I just wanted things to play out okay, and was hoping that with each episode SOMETHING will change my opinion of anything. Well, nothing like that really happened. 
I did not feel good watching throughout, and did not feel satisfied at the end.  
Last comments: 
Overall, I can sum up my experience with Nagi-Asu in two words: exhausting and frustrating. The melodrama was painful. The romance was awful. The story was disappointing. Only the art and sound gets points from me, which is sad, because I don't want to contain my positive opinions of any anime to just these two aspects. I believe the biggest issue is with the characters that are chosen to be the bearers of the story. I felt the same way with another PA Works anime, Hanasaku Iroha - beautiful art, but characters lack appeal.  
But, this is just my personal take. Perhaps you will more things enjoyable and delightful in Nagi-Asu that I either ignored or couldn't see in my blind rage.

This anime is perfect. 
A young man who understands the world around him too well due to the horrors that he's seen and the torture he's endured, is faced with what he's used to. Criminal minds, criminal plans and criminal mysteries. Despite how unique he is, it's always possible to see yourself in him. When he does the wrong thing for the right reason, and doesn't explain why to anyone, choosing instead to let them hate him. 
When he can't decide where his heart belongs, or whether he should live the life he wants or the one he feels he deserves. Ash, a brilliantly skilled, unpredictable misfit who knows everything but who he is, is faced with the one thing he could never have: innocence. 
To watch his character develop is like watching a leopard grow: acts on instinct, fights to survive. Ash isn't a villain, despite what he does. He just chooses to do the right thing only when he decides he wants to, which you would think is selfish, but in reality, it's what all of us are like. Ash just does it with less hesitation, choosing to do now and fix later. 
Ash's relationship with Eiji Okumura is the purest form of love you'll ever see. A broken soul is conflicted with another that wants to repair it. 
Don't be fooled by the playful name. 'Banana Fish' is a war zone where even you won't survive. 
I could easily say this is the greatest show I have ever seen. It will be for some time. A beautiful selection of memorable and emotional music, animation that pleases the eye, voices that speak into your soul, a plot with perfect pacing and an array of characters who will connect with you however they can. 
Banana Fish is a masterpiece.

The series has a calm and kind atmosphere about it. Even in dangerous situations it feels mostly calm somehow. Also I find that it flows well and mostly isn't predictable which makes it very interesting to watch. 
Art 
Beautiful art style. Fits well with the story. 
Sound 
The music and sound/s are awesome. The character voices fit well. 
The opening and ending are beautiful and fit the series very well. 
Character 
The characters are lovely. Maybe it's unrealistic that they're all so kind and reasonable (and if they're shown unkind and later turn out kind in their core) but I love them. 
Enjoyment 
I love it. 
Overall 
There are few situations that seem unrealistic but overall it's an awesome series/season!

This is the best anime I have watched in a while! It was inspiring to the point where I started doing university work at - at night and I think of rewatching it from time to time just to remind myself of the feeling it gave me! The story is simple but yet amazing and very relatable (although not to the extremes show in it). It made me feel for the characters, holding my breath every time they were facing a difficulty and at the same time made me laugh outloud when they were having a good time! As you have probably guessed, it has its ecchi moments but they are not much and become gradually less and less as the anime progresses. I am not going to do any deeper explanations on why I like the anime because in my opinion those extensive reviews ruin the fun of the anime, not to mention that most of them are written by people far too crittical for their own good.

I really despise this movie. Not because of anything about the movie itself, as it would have been perfectly enjoyable in a vacuum. The problem with Laputa is its utter lack of originality. Every single thing about this movie is Future Boy Conan. Its about -- hours shorter and paced to account for the difference, but there is not a single thing about the content of this movie that is not directly copied from that show. Aside from the significantly more impressive visuals and soundtrack expected with the name Ghibli, nothing feels remotely unique to Laputa as anything more than a clone of Conan with a different Miyazaki filter applied to it. The difference between the two is little more than the difference between two bullshit isekai with fans parading a minute twist as a totally original show. As soon as it became evident that the film would have nothing more to offer, the only possible enjoyment for me was matching up every single plot point and occasionally even scene to one I had already seen. Without a doubt this is the superior form of the story, but having seen the other Laputa offers absolutely nothing to a viewer aside from looking stunning.

It's not often I find a Anime that I can enjoy so much without finding any flaws in it. Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is possibly one of the best Anime I have ever watched. I have only one complaint about this anime, and that is Okonoge's (English dub) voice being that shrill, girly voice that tends to grate on one's nerves. That aside, the rest of the anime is amazing. 
It's funny, has an excellent story that keeps you interested every step of the way and most of the characters actually have likable traits. Unfortunately, this anime is rather short. Thankfully though, while it is short, it does provide you with the sense that it doesn't really need any more episodes once you've seen the last episode. 
I give this anime a -- in all departments even though I found Okonogi to be a rather annoying character. The music for this anime is just amazing. I loved the opening and closing songs. They were among the best I've heard and I rarely even bother listening to them more than once. So, I highly recommend watching this anime if you haven't seen it yet.

So reading the tags of this anime (action, sci-fi) you may think (like i did): ""Cool! Custom cute robots fighting!""; well that was true, but not the only truth. Most of the anime will lack a TRUE background plot and the fighting scenes are not...really the top... 
Let me explain in the deep: 
Plot - - (i am being good here) 
Basically it's a slice of life anime without a defined plot. After the first episode you could see the ep -, then the - and you will notice NOTHING. The only exception to this are some minor arcs of two episodes but that's all; you can see the last two episodes after the first one and all will looks just fine. Not a single evolution of events in the whole anime, boring. 
Characters - - 
Standards characters: a blond and a blue airheads, the tsundere and the heroine. The master is a totally bland character so they are just ""mediocre"" 
Enjoyment - - (that's my personal opinion) 
I hate it. The first episode was promising with Ann (the heroine) almost defeating in a fight one of the champion of the tournament but that's all: no tournament, no serious battle. A lot of girls fighting to be pat by their master, looks like an harem -_-' 
Overall - - 
Are you ok with a casual plot? Are you ok with characters without any kind of ""soul""? Well if you are give a shot. If you are looking for some real action with cool characters click back or close your browser and run away from here.

A total disappointment of expectations 
I was so eager to see Enoshima Junko in action, using the weakness of the characters to manipulate and bring them to the vision of a world sunk in despair. 
But nothing happened as expected, instead of the characters slowly falling into despair, the first episodes were a tedious slice of life that could not even create sympathy for the characters (almost no one would connect to any of them except those who played Danganronpa -) and nearly to the end, Junko uses literally BRAIN WASHING in the characters, instead of the influence and the gab that I expected from the character that I devised as a genius of manipulation. 
Chiaki's presence in the anime was just a fan service and destroyed the essence of the character in the game. 
When this anime is analyzed individually (regardless of the game), it gets even worse. The only really interesting parts are those created especially for anime, but those who came from the second game has lost their essence completely.

Okay, I do not understand what this 'episode -' is about. Skip this episode and go directly to watch episodes ----, because this one has nothing to do with the actual anime; it's just some try-to-be for the REAL anime. Believe me, this episode is not worth watching. PLUS it makes you think the following episodes will be all like that, when it isn't like that at all.  
This first episode is boring, the music, the expressions, it's all boring. Unlike the following episodes, which are all amazing and perfectly well-done and I couldn't stop laughing with all of them. It's as if this had been directed by some completely different person than who directed the rest of the episodes. I sincerely can't understand how this is so bad, being one of the biggest Nichijou (specially Yukko) fans that exist. 
So in my recommendation, skip this episode/OVA or whatever it is and go directly to watch episodes ---- which are the real Nichijou anime.

*Spoilers~ 
Have you ever wondered what it would be like it living with a bunch of middle aged hipsters turned freedom fighters as a young teenager with Stockholm syndrome? Wonder no more.  
Eureka Seven is the age old of tale of reckless youth, expectations, and truly finding ones self. Renton, a wayward youth bored of his simple life, is lured into the glamorous world of lifting when the Gekkostate comes to his small town. With promises of fast hover boards and faster women Renton is quick to trade his old mundane life for a promising new one. However, all is not as it seems and Renton quickly discovers the Gekkostate hides many dark secrets. Holland, the leader of the Gekkostate, uses hallucinogenic drugs, violence, and extortion to control the rest of the crew in a cult-like manner and it is reveal the Gekkostate is really an anti-government terrorist cell. Trapped with no way out, Renton finds himself the victim of constant abuse with his only escape being when he is able to confide in Eureka, another young member on the Gekkostate who he develops feelings for. Renton is forced to make the difficult choice of trying to escape his new found prison or fight to save the girl he loves. At least, that is my headcanon.  
In the future terrorism has a new face. No longer is it exclusive to extremist, unless you include the extremely rad, terrorism is now done by the trendy and hip. Bombings are traded in for sick hover board tricks and beheading videos are traded in for pop culture magazines made to inspire the youth to rise up and join the cause. This premise is stupid and I hate it. However, since I am also stupid and hate myself I decided to watch Eureka Seven anyways, and it ended up being not the worst thing in the world. One of my favorite aspects of Eureka Seven is just how bizarre it can be. There are mecha that ride hover boards and transform into race cars and sometimes jets. There are aliens that look like balloon animals that eat people. There are even plants that look like cute girls. Truly there is some wacky shit going on in this universe.  
Unfortunately Eureka Seven does a poor job of balancing its many themes and ideas. Instead of taking the time to focus on any one of its more interesting concepts, the story tends to introduce them just so they can be promptly ignored for the sometimes cute but generally tedious relationship drama between the two main characters Renton and Eureka. This seems to be a product of simply too many things shoved into one story which isn't helped by the uneven pacing that can make the interesting aspects of the series seem underdeveloped while making the less interesting aspects more of a slog to get through. I really would have preferred to learn more about certain characters and plot threads rather than sitting through more sappy romantic dialogue. 
Another issue brought about by the many conflicting story elements in Eureka Seven is the inconsistent tone. Switching between slice of life, romance, and war drama makes for some jarring transitions. One episode will have Renton and Eureka go through a minor relationship problem while the next episode will have people's arms getting ripped off. Characters sometimes even lose all internal logic and consistency in the same dialogue interaction going from ""This is a serious operation!"" to ""WoAh loOK aT tHat WavE bRo, LEt'S LIft!"". I truly believe the series would be vastly better had it focused on just one angle.   
The characters of Eureka Seven are a complicated thing, as I think they are potentially the best and worst thing about the series. Renton, the protagonist of the series, is a likeable guy. After seeing Eureka he falls in love with her for anime reasons and decides to throw everything  
away and join the Gekkostate just to be with her. Despite Renton's questionable reasoning abilities, which plagues him throughout the series, he is hard working, driven, and always tries his best regardless of how poorly he is treated. Being a teenager and a mecha protagonist however Renton still has his mandatory angst arc, but it's not as annoying as say, Amuro from Mobile Suit Gundam or Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion as Renton actually has some legitimate reasons to be upset. Eureka is the token dandere of the series and is, as mention before, the main love interest. Though she doesn't stand out much the story explanation for her dandere personality traits are well written and believable enough.  
The rest of the Gekkostate are, for the most part, giant cunts. Imagine the most obnoxious hipster stereotypes you can and then turn them into anti-government terrorists because that is essentially the crew of the Gekkostate. First off, most of these degenerates are far too old to be acting the way they do and they come off as those creepy forty year olds that hang out parties with teenagers. Needless to say I wouldn't trust any of them around small children, especially Hap and Stoner. Second, they are just mean spirited people as they treat Renton like garbage despite his best efforts to be useful to them. They constantly haze him, use him for bitchwork, and use him as scapegoat when it suits them and all for no reason other than he is the new guy I guess. This can be difficult to watch considering Renton appears to be the hardest working and most decent member among an otherwise unorganized, unmotivated, and unprofessional hippie cult turned anti-government terrorists.  
The biggest offender however has to be the Gekkostate's leader, Holland. Holland is an ex-military man who deserts after some psychic homeless man tells him to rethink his life. It turns out that the homeless man is the leader of some plant cult and impressed by his telekinesis Holland forms the Gekkostate and becomes a raging asshole who is unable to accept any responsibility for anything. Instead, Holland takes his anger out by abusing Renton either physically or mentally while other members of the Gekko just stand by and watch. Holland eventually becomes slightly less psychopathic in some poor attempt at a character arc as we learn the reason he is so cunty is because of his jealously of Renton being chosen by Eureka instead of himself. To say the justifications for any of these characters' actions towards Renton fall short is an understatement as they all just come off as disgustingly selfish. I guess I should applaud the show for it's realistic portrayal of how bad a bunch of radical hipsters would be at anything useful, but really I was just expecting Renton to say ""Don't go to Gekkostate tomorrow, some of you are cool people..."".    
Standing in stark contrast of the Gekkostate are the freelance mercenaries Ray and Charles who are arguably the best characters in the entire series. Both use to belong to the same special forces group that Holland did and it is implied through flashbacks that they all share a rich history together but yet again it just doesn't get much focus. However, what is important is Charles, the disco king, is manly as fuck and equally benevolent. Together the both of them take in a disillusioned Renton when he abandons the Gekkostate about midway through the series. In that time, Renton discovers what family is as Ray and Charles treat him with the gentle and loving kindness that the Gekkostate never did. And here is one my biggest points of contention with the series, Renton decides to go back to the Gekkostate seemingly forgetting all of their transgressions or just accepting it because writing is hard. It would be one thing if he was just going back for Eureka as is initially implied but he ends up staying with them for rest of the series as if nothing had ever happened.  
Luckily most of the remaining characters are fairly logical and well reasoned individuals as the story also follows the military as they chase down the Gekkostate. The main two being Dominic and Anemone who are foils to Renton and Eureka albeit with a slightly healthier or unhealthier relationship depending on how you look at it. Dominic acts as the unstable Anemone's handler and he oversees her battles. It is clear that there is a bond despite how one sided it may be and it is a shame their relationship didn't get more of the spotlight so it could develop naturally rather than them just turning into the perfect couple at the last minute. Regardless, it is still pretty cute I guess and they are enjoyable characters. A special shout out to Jurgens who plays the role of the stern captain with the golden heart. It is endearing watching him as he puts up with all these hormonal teenagers and their bullshit. He is a surprisingly sympathetic and relatable character despite his short screen time. Lastly, there is the main antagonist of the series Dewey, who should be noted for his spectacular ability to be a threatening antagonist despite being named Dewey. He also has some pretty sick burns when pretenders try to step up to him. Beyond that Dewey is probably the most complex character in the show and has a good mixture of mystery, sense of duty, and scheming that is compelling to watch as it all unfolds. 
While it is arguable whether there are more hits or more misses when it comes to the characters of Eureka Seven, the show certainly focuses on the misses a lot more. As the story tries to paint the Gekkostate as the good guys the disparity of their actions paints the opposite, thus making the time spent on them seem pointless. Meanwhile the military seems like pretty chill guys to have beers with. Again, more focus on these characters would have been great but they are still entertaining for what we do get. Ultimately the show ends up in this weird position where the characters are both what keep you invested but also makes you want to turn away.  
Production value wise Eureka Seven is pretty impressive and Bones does a admirable job. The art for the most part is pretty unique taking influence from Japanese LSD culture and the bizarre visuals support that. They manage to make giant balloon animal demons terrifying which speaks for itself. Interestingly enough I found the weakest part of the art to be the mecha design despite the novelty of them being able to turn into race cars and planes and ride hover boards. I was also pleasantly surprised by the English dub being quite good so that's worth mentioning.  
Eureka Seven is a giant mess of ideas woven into a ridiculous story that is entirely clueless when it comes to putting it all together. Despite that, it also has a direction and vision that is far from uninspired or generic which is very commendable. And though I still can't tell if it's secretly genius or just retarded I was able to find enjoyment in all of the absurd madness the show had to offer and it was a fascinating ride in the end. That said, I hope the Japanese learned their lesson and never take LSD again.

The Devil is a Part-Timer had an outstanding story at the beginning and middle, but as the anime reached the end of the season, things were anticlimactic considering it was a finale. I would also like Ente Isla to be more expansive and add to the story more than it did. However, it was a super funny show and a great slice of life, but the action/different world/devil part was a little lacking. The last episode did not even end on a cliffhanger for the following season (which may not even happen). More plot twists and more things happening would have been good for the story to meet its full potential. The art was good but nothing special, while the soundtrack added intensity and emotion. Despite the slightly lacking story, I really enjoyed this anime and it was funny and I would recommend it IF a second season would come. Or just read the manga.

Where to begin. Pretentious. Plain and simple. 
This anime is awful. In all the anime I have seen I believe an overwhelming majority of them had something to say and left the viewer with at least one thought at its conclusion. This does not do that in the slightest. That is not without it trying to do so.  
Story: Garbage confusing and says nothing. IN the end it left me feeling and asking for what reason was this made.  
Art: The art was very impressive and fluid. I will without a doubt mention that merit which it indeed deserves. The action scenes are very well choreographed and in full attention as well as the character designs which were absolutely inspired... EXCEPT the annoying blushed cheeks on Lily which I hate to a point of rage but the annoyance of the cheeks is minor compared to my hatred of Lily as a character which ill discuss further down. 
Sound: The sound was good i guess I don't really pay attention to that. I could probably watch any anime on sub on mute no issue. But the English voice actors were good fit the characters well again I don't really care much about the sound. 
Characters: Lily.. Lily... Lily... Oh Lily another Nami-Sakura character. by that i mean loud aggressive overbearing piece of anime rubbish. In all honestly she did not do one single thing in the entire series of importance or added to the plot whatsoever. NOT ONE SINGLE THING. As i am typing this i feel so upset but i can say calmly i just want the people making anime to stop making characters ]like this. I know there supposed to be loud and scream at the protagonist in a loving jovial way that is supposed to be light-hearted but please STOP. Characters like this are the most annoying worthless upsetting part if the anime. Looking at the tone of this anime this character does not belong. even in a comedy anime. And I am not saying there shouldn't be lighthearted and funny moments but don't make everytime a character like this come on screen in ruins the whole atmosphere. And I want to make something clear I love over the top loud characters examples being Kamina from Gurren Lagann.  But there is a point where it goes overboard./ I mean look at the way Lily talks to her superiors at work. SHe is a cop have some respect. Im gonna stop because I could do an essay on Nami-Sakura characters and i want to stop.  
Otherwise the other characters were okay there was no development in characters at all.  If you examine all the characters from beginning to end you notice that nothing changes AT ALL. Yes things happen there was a beginning middle and end in a story and characters received more information and did things as the story progressed. NOTHING CHANGES IN THE STORY AT ALL development wise.  
Overall: I didn't like it. I want to say I DIDN""T LIKE IT AT ALL but i would be lying at the sole fact that I enjoyed the first fight on the train and the characters looked great apart from LIly's cheeks.  
But i would be remiss if I didn't recommend an alternative to this waste of time so I will say that if you watched this for the same reason I did which is it looked cool and the trailers showed good action and an amazing story of mystery. You should and I say you should again. Make sure you watch Monster and Hunter X Hunter. Give monster - episode and I promise you will love it. and i dont really have to mention why you should watch HXH ask anybody who have seen it. 
excuse grammer and punctuation mistakes just wanted to get my opions off directly and accurately while ignoring spelling and such

every once in a while comes an anime so bad that should really be stopped before the season ends. Maou-sama, Retry is definitely this one. 
if you ask me what anime is this similar to then i'll say Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku. 
because of the Generic story and cliche settings. 
also reminds me of an Overlord rip-off but not in a good way, more like a ""cheap chinese product i bought in -$ in the internet"" kind of way. 
*I don't think i can make spoilers to such a cliche story but be warned anyway* 
the most annoying thing about this anime is the music and sounds. it has unrelated music through all of the episode and really bad sound effects. I heard worse dubbing so this one is OK but the annoying music that plays in the background seriously make it unbearable. Some one needs to tell them it's OK not to play music! In the -th episode they put a flut that sounds too much like shittyflut (if you don't know it search youtube), Overall reminds me more of a Maplestory soundtrack than an anime. 
the story isn't better as its as cliche as it can get and we are expose to a tiny bit of this new world mainly revolving around on-surface, unimportant interaction between main character and some others, everyone else could be ""random dummy"" as they don't seem to have characteristics of their own or other motives (even the design is like a mass production) . 
the animation is decent but the action scenes are really pathetic, no movement can be seen which makes it looks like they got lazy doing the hard part of what makes a good fight scene.  
by the -rd episode it was clear that no action scene from this will be even decent. 
overall DON'T WATCH IT!

""Quod Subigo Farinam"" - Terry Pratchett (Feet of Clay, ----) 
Once upon a time Sega were a powerhouse of the videogames world, but these days they appear to have lost much of their former glory - mainly because their most visible releases are little more than revisions of Sonic the Hedgehog. Fortunately the blue rodent isn't the only weapon in Sega's arsenal, and the company have a plethora of titles just waiting to be rereleased or resurrected (Phantasy Star, Rolling Thunder, Kid Chameleon, Strider, Afterburner, Space Harrier, Daytona, Panzer Dragoon, Sakura Taisen, Wonder Boy, Alex Kidd, and many others). There are even a few rare ones that fans would love to see completed (Dear Sega, Please finish Shenmue. Thanking you in advance). 
In addition to their massive back catalogue of games, Sega also own a role-playing franchise that is quite possibly the largest and most diverse in the genre - the Shining series (and before all the fans have a collective apoplexy, according to Nintendo there are only eighteen official Zelda titles). 
The first game - Shining in the Darkness - was a straightforward dungeon crawler that appeared on the Megadrive/Genesis back in ----. Subsequent additions to the franchise ventured into the realms of turn-based strategy, tactical role-playing, third-person action/adventure, and even first-person RPG - and repeatedly demonstrated Sega's desire to experiment with the fantasy genre. Since that time the series has proven to be extremely popular in various parts of the world, and the release of the --th title - Shining Blade on the Playstation Portable - only serves to highlight the strength of the franchise. 
With such a history behind it, what could possibly go wrong with an anime adaptation of the --th game - Shining Hearts: Shiawase no Pan. 
Set on the quaint little island of Wyndaria, the story follows the deeds of Rick - a handsome amnesiac castaway who now works at the island's bakery alongside the three young ladies who appear to own the business - Airy Ardet, Neris Filiam and Amil Manaflare. Everything is peaceful as Rick learns how to heroically knead the dough in order to bake loaves of manliness, croissants of courage, baguettes of bravery, and other such things on his journey to make the titular ""Bread of Happiness"". 
Unfortunately the arrival of another castaway called Kaguya throws his world into the mixing bowl and forgets to add any sort of raising agent. 
There are many varieties of bread in the world, and some of them are quite tasty in their own right. Shining Hearts is, unfortunately, nothing more than a mass-produced white loaf that's in dire need of a little bit of cheese or some kind of filling in order to make it palatable. The formulaic plot is made up of basic storytelling ingredients that appear to have been added using a shovel as a measuring cup, and the resulting narrative tends to fall apart - even though the writers have struggled to mix everything together before getting baked. 
The first half of the series is little more than a glorified meet-and-greet as Rick and his female companions find themselves in the middle of several rather placid adventures that all seem to be resolved using bread - and no, they don't hit each other with baguettes (more's the pity). The storyline does show some improvements during the latter half of the show, but by that point there's simply not enough broadcast time to offer the answers to some important questions (i.e. Who is Rick? What is the Island of Wyndaria? Why am I watching a fantasy adventure about bread? etc). This results in a string of important storyline events occurring one after another as the show tries to cram as much as possible into the narrative in order to tie up various loose ends. 
Shining Hearts is filled with all manner of quaint buildings and pastoral scenes that highlight the rural nature of the island, but while everything looks pleasant enough, there's a distinct lack of imagination on display. The problem lies in the fact that this is an adaptation of a fantasy JRPG - and in many cases these games will feature towns and villages that have a certain ... continental flavour to them. No-one seems to fully understand why, but for some reason there's a tendency amongst developers to assume that all fantasy adventure games take place somewhere in Europe (e.g. Sword Art Online, Tears to Tiara, .Hack//, Ragnarok, Druaga no Tou, etc). 
When it comes to animation things are a little more muddled as there's a surprising blandness that permeates a number of scenes - even though the quality is generally pretty decent for the majority of the show. Part of the reason for this is the character animation and the tendency to rely on stereotypical behaviour patterns in order to make specific female roles more appealing to a certain audience. This mentality lies at the heart of the character design as well, and aside from a few minor modifications, everyone looks much the same as they do in the game - but that's nothing to be proud of as pointy chins and almond-shaped faces are the order of the day. 
Which brings up an interesting point about the aims of the producers - but more on that in a bit. 
The opening sequence features a track called ""Jisei-kai ~Toki Sekai~"" sung by Aizawa Mai (Neris), Itou Kanae (Amil), and Mikami Shiori (Airy) - alongside some tourist-friendly images of Wyndaria and the seas around it, scenes where the lead characters run in a group or gaze heroically off into the distance, birds flying, and the obligatory bread shots. It's a fairly typical beginning that ticks many of the boxes in the ""How to Make an Anime OP"" handbook, and the ending is no better. The closing sequence features lots of background bread in different shapes and sizes, and the three lead actresses perform ""Fuwafuwa no Mahou"" while their respective characters pose and dance in a manner that is designed to pander to fans with a tendency to shout ""kawaii!"" and ""moe!"" at anything female, humanoid and vaguely attractive. 
Shining Hearts features some diverse and well-crafted audio effects, but their usage is hampered by repeated issues with timing, choreography and intensity. The background music - a mixture of light-hearted fluff pieces, medieval-inspired ditties and dramatic/serious melodies - is more subtle than one might expect, but several scenes can have an odd feeling to them because of the style and composition of the tracks on offer. In addition to this the script is fairly bland and doesn't appear to have taxed any of the voice actors - which has resulted in the dialogue being delivered in a rather banal style that is typical of many shounen anime where action scenes involve lots of shouting and pouting. 
Sadly this workaday attitude extends to the characters themselves - many of whom are little more than eye-candy that moves around and does ... stuff. The reason for this is the lack of any real conviction where relationships are concerned - which is basically what happens when someone decides to remove a major familial bond without thinking it through or replacing it with something equally important. In addition to this the speed of the narrative appears to have caused the producers to ignore or forget the purpose of supporting characters, and because of this the lead roles are severely under-developed for a show of this type. 
Which brings us back to the aims of the producers - a factor that is closely tied into the design of the characters. 
In a very real sense any visual media is similar to food in that the first bite is with the eye, and many people will make a snap-judgement about something based solely on how it looks. This is the reason why games developers are often quick to capitalise on popular trends - especially those that are rooted in otaku or geek culture - and the most common is to utilise the talents of well-known artists - some of whom have made their names in hentai or eroge. Unfortunately this approach does not guarantee success as titles that rely on the marketability of the lead designer are often aimed at specific audiences - and even though there may be lucrative merchandising opportunities, the lack of publicity will severely affect the popularity of a game. 
In the case of Sega's primary RPG franchise, Shining Hearts is the third of four titles that feature the talents of popular eroge artist Tony Taka - and therein lies the problem with the anime. 
Like many adaptations the producers have simply regurgitated the character designs from the source material, but in this case that means that the lead female roles consist of a buxom tavern maid, a busty milk maid and a sexy nun - all of whom apparently work as bakers. Add to that a supporting cast of female characters who are little more than walking merchandising opportunities and it becomes obvious that this is simply an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of the franchise, and to a lesser degree the artist. 
The sad thing is that even though the story that lacked the depth of other food-based shows (Yakitate Japan! for example - and that's saying something), Shining Hearts still had potential if the adaptation had run for longer and been more true to the game. Unfortunately the titular ""Bread of Happiness is nowhere to be found, and viewers are left with nothing but a bitter selection of inane details that would be right at home in any middle-class anime fan's conversation book. 
Bread isn't famous for its peacemaking abilities. Cake would have been an understandable alternative (unless the story is about the French Revolution). 
Or Parfait. Everybody loves parfait.

I could start this review off with some philosphical statement. You know, one of the many you saw in this show, but instead I'll take this time to welcome myself to reviewing anime. This will be my first review, and if you have any coments on it, please hit my profile up and I'll be glad to help you with anything. 
Now, I don't judge anime on any pretext other than my own enjoyment and own opinions. So please bare with me :). 
Now, the story although not episodic has an episodic feel. Almost as if the stories broken up a bit, but that's all character developement and emotion. I believe, the beging of this anime is as important as the end. There's quite a few plot twists; all of witch you don't expect. There are a few episodes that again although aren't fillers  feel as if they have no meaning aside from portraying certain emotions or to help develope characters. Overall the story is absolutely amazing, no questions asked. I'd personally give it a -/--(It'd be --/-- if it had an ending that gave off a difinitive ending). 
The artwork was quite dark. You didn't get to see much of the ""Happy go lucky"" parades.(Although, there was that one episode ;-) ). I found everything well drawn, it wasn't an over used animation style(Moe?) but it didn't bring anything new to the table. I'd give it a -/--. 
The music in this anime, is very subjective. Now, it doesen't have anything you'll remember the rest of your life, nothing just jaw dropping but every song every sound from voices to footsteps all fit into the show perfectly. I'd give it a subtle --/-- for doing everything sound is meant to do. 
How likable a character is, will always be debatable. It will always be an opinion however something you can't argue, is the developement. We saw multiple characters develope and change in this story, and it really was something amazing to watch. Mix that and the fact you won't forget about these characters, and they earn a very solid --/-- in my books. 
Enjoyment, this is what I like to look at and say ""Oh cool someone gets to just BS their way through a review section"". Now, don't get me wrong, this was my favourite anime of all time. But I can't tell you if you will enjoy it. There's plot twists, amazing characters great sound, and an over-the-top-in-a-good-way-story. It's a --/-- for me, but fill this in with your own rating afterwards. 
Overall, this anime is something you will never forget. The converversy in the ending, the amazing fight scenes throughout(Not really ""Fighting"") mixed with drama and amazing..Everything leads to one of my favourite animes of all time. It's an overall -- from me.

You'll probably read a lot of reviews, good and bad, about Naruto Shippuden. Personally, I was glad that the old Naruto ended and we had a time skip to when they are teenagers (not that I didn't enjoy some aspects of the old one but that's a whole other review). 
Story: I like that they all have grown up a bit. You can tell some thought has been put into their characters now. Even Sakura (cringe) has developed characteristically some. Naruto isn't *totally* a blubbering idiot. After awhile it just gets annoying to see everyone whining and acting like the elementary kids they are modeled to be. The story has some darkness to it now. The Akatsuki are rampaging across the Ninja Lands. Everyone is forced to fight. I mean, it's becoming a more adult(ish) anime while still preserving funny parts. Of course, we'd love to skip the fillers if we could, but truthfully, a lot of my favorite episodes have been fillers. I think most of them (not all) are beneficial to developing the characters and, let's face it, it's just that many more episodes to look back on after Naruto is over for good. 
Art: I rated this a - because they can really change from awesome to... (well see certain scenes of the Pain arc). It just seems sometimes the ""good"" artists took a sick day or something when some episodes are being done. 
Sound: I love just about all of the opening and closing songs. They are usually fitting choices with the feel they seem to be going for at the time. Also, their sounds effects are average enough to not seem to noticeably out of place. The songs they use in the episodes are okay, it's just that they've used most of the same ones since the beginning of Naruto and, frankly, I'm getting tired of the recycling. I think the fans are worth looking up a few more pieces of music... Also, sometimes they play their ""epic"" song (I don't know these names I just know that they play this when Naruto starts to get hyped up about something) at random times. It usually causes a good laugh. 
Character: As I said before, I really like that things seem to be growing up more than before. It's hard to describe without spoilers, but it just seems to mature which is great. 
Enjoyment: I eagerly sign on every Thursday to check out the newest episode and watch it on the spot whether its a filler or not. I enjoy the show and I'll probably be following to the very end. 
Overall it's an - for me. It would be higher, but for the sheer mass of fillers, random sound issues, and sloppy artwork from time to time. I would like to add one last thing, though: I can deal with the fillers, but the thing that makes me want to punch my computer screen is the flashbacks. Flashbacks every four seconds usually. There was one recent episode (at the Summit) that was one giant flashback recapping ALL of the episodes including the original Naruto. My. God. I understand that we need some from time to time to refresh our memories, but it got to the point that I could start reciting parts of scenes because of the flashbacks. Biggest downside: flashbacks. 
Anyways, I'd still recommend this anime to anyone who asked. I think it's dumb not to give it a try just because it's popular. It's just as stupid to NOT do something because it's popular than to do it because it is.

There is not much more to say about this other than that it is THE masterpiece. This anime is perfect in all ways. The variety of characters and personalities developed throughout the characters are what put this show on the top. The light-hearted humorous scenes were well balanced with dark, vicious scenes to create an anime that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire anime. The plot behind the anime is superb along with the detailed fight scenes and lessons that characters learned as a result. Not to mention this anime also has a killer soundtrack and animation to go along with it. The only bad thing about the anime is that all other anime you watch after this will not even compare...

It's going to be tough reviewing this, since I didn't exactly love the show, nor did I hate it. The reason why I'm saying that is because each episode felt pretty long, meaning it lost my interest multiple times. Oddly enough, even though each episode dragged on and felt boring I couldn't help but to click on the next episode. That being said I didn't drop the show, I didn't hate it nor did I love it. Before I get into the breakdown of the show I want to say that this show might be a hit or miss, and I feel like this show might be for a younger audience. I'm not saying it's a kid show, but for the mystery genre, the 'cases' they solve might seem uninteresting to someone who has seen better mystery shows. 
Story: 
The show takes place at school, where one student is told by his sister to continue the spirit of a dying club. After excepting the role of being the potential only member of the club he meets a girl who changes the way he lives his daily school life. As a few more members join the club together they solve mysteries ranging from school events to rumors.  
So the show is basically about a group of friends who get together to solve mysteries mainly involving their school. There are a few episodes where they do things out of school, but other than that it's mainly school related. So if you're a fan of anime that usually don't go outside the realm of school this might be a cool show for you. 
Characters: 
My main issue with this is that the characters were there, the characters were fun, but they didn't do anything that interesting.  
The main character Oreki has this outlook on life that he absolutely needs to be lazy, anything involving work is a hassle to him. Although he is lazy he is actually pretty clever and can solve most mysteries easily. solving the mysteries contradicts his outlook of being absolutely lazy, so sometimes his character is a bit witty and fun. 
The other main character Chitanda is the one who motivates Oreki to solve cases. She's not much other than that in the show, I mean she helps with the cases as much as the other two characters. 
Like I said earlier, the characters were fun and interesting, I would have really liked to see them solving other cases besides pointless school cases. 
Other than the main characters there are side characters who you actually see appear from time to time, which is something that I really like. It was a nice touch having characters who go to the same school making reappearances because you know, they do go to the same school after all. 
Art: 
This one is odd, cause some shots in the show are very artistic with things like a beautiful sunset, then there are other scenes where they just look like a normal show. Then the art gets a little too crazy when they start to talk about there mysteries. When they talk about their cases the show goes to a completely different style of art. These little scenes are nice, I like them a lot. Also the music was good, they reused songs too much but they weren't bad songs. 
Overall: 
Not the greatest mystery show, yet it wasn't exactly a waste of time. I do want to say though the second half of the show was a lot better than the first half. So if you decide to watch this one just keep in mind that it does get more interesting. 
Pros: Fun characters 
Cons: Boring at times

I accidentally came upon this anime and the description I read (and a spoiler-y review) convinced me to watch it. 
After the first episode I was instantly charmed by the artwork which reminded me strongly of K-ON, animation, soundtrack and the story line. It's a slow paced anime so I hoped that the exposition will take time and it will end in a bang. My theory of course was incorrect because the anime was segmented into three main story-lines that were not of equal footing. Personally I thought that if the anime ended after the first ten episodes it would have still remained a good anime.  
The first story was so good that anything following it just seemed to fall flat and the character development was very slow. I suppose it's possible to read into it but I expected something more on the character level of the anime.  
However what really got me into this anime was the feeling I got while watching this anime. A strong sense of strangeness and other-ness wrapped around the existing world, something similar to xxxHolic and Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei, even -- Club manga, where you have a feeling you will fall on your head any moment. I enjoyed the intelligence of the main character and his interaction with his best friend. How the anime was set up, I expected something more sinister however, something we don't get even with the abundance of jealousy and loneliness present.  
The ending is in the same level of disappointment. It's anti-climatic and completely unrelated to the main-plot of the anime, the mystery, as if it was forgotten in favor of the subplot. I can't say that I don't like how love is presented in this anime, rather normally considering other anime with a few exceptions, but exactly because of that it should not have been the main focus. Truly a disappointment to the anime that started very good then kept falling and dragging out until I had to fast-forward a couple of times just to see something happen. 
Overall, I enjoyed many separate aspects of the anime, however nothing can compensate for me being bored by it especially considering it's supposed to be a mystery anime.

Why. 
Whyyyyyyyyyyyy. 
Season - didn’t need to exist. Season - without a doubt also didn’t need to exist. My faith in anime ends once Season - is announced. 
OneRoom S- continues the trend of creepy Point of View storytelling with awkward camera angles that don’t make any sense as a POV anime. POV isn’t my cup of tea, but at the very least the anime can commit to it. It sacrifices its POV shtick for creepy camera shots of these characters. All it does is make you feel uncomfortable, overly awkward, and a douche as an insert character. OneRoom really wants it’s viewers to imagine themselves as the main character. This works in things like RPGs where you make your own character and all, but not something like this where the camera (Where you as a character are looking at) keeps jumping all over the damn place. It’s inconsistent and breaks whatever immersion you somehow manage to have while watching it (Which ---% of the time is usually none whatsoever.) If the characters weren’t always designed to look like FBI bait, it’d be easier to sit through. I do *kinda* like the fact that the first arc focused on a girl from the previous season though, as it presented a chance for actual plot development. However, it was just more of the same. The other arcs were also uneventful, vague in what it wanted to do as a story, and ultimately felt like a waste of time. You won’t care about who any of these girls are and will forget them basically after each episode. The animation certainly looked good, but that’s really the only thing worth praising. After thinking about it, it might be worse than Season - purely due to the fact that it’s not as fun to make fun of. It was too dull and boring to really talk shit about. Like season one, OneRoom S- doesn’t work as a romance, doesn’t work as a slice of life, doesn’t work as a POV production, and doesn’t work in general. Keep this series dead. Let it die. Let it fade into obscurity. It’s for the best. No one will miss it.

Presumably the most expected anime of the ----/---- Winter season, and the new year Death Note conveys story components and an intelligent honesty that is all the more generally seen in your collegeate scholarly classics than your ordinary Shounen Jump title.  
The story is about the uprightness of mortal equity guy who successively esteemed in a general sense imperfect by corrupt, limited limit of man and their profoundly ruooted feeling of pride and grandiosity. The lead character Light is the incarnation of this talk, a once apparently immaculate character determined to fixation on the idea of getting to be similar to a divine being. Right away his plans are conventional -attackers, kid molesters, serial executioners -should bite the dust and die, correct? The world would be better without them, correct? Putting such power under the control of a mortal- -as immaculate as Light may be- -debases, as history demonstrates over and over.  
Going with the Death Note is its unique holder, the Shinigami Ryuk. Instead of being ethically bound to Light or serving as an inner voice or aide, Ryuk sticks around just to be an onlooker -declaring people to be ""fascinating.""  
While this itself makes for a fascinating plot, what truly makes Death Note a top bore arrangement are the characters who cause an obstacle to Light's main goal. Topping the cast is the fan-most loved L, whose character is simply past portrayal. A shady, puzzling, however sort of capricious virtuoso, L is likely the main personality that could match the conspiring Light. The feline and-mouse strategic maneuver between the two youngsters is tempting and arresting, making you giggle (not for comic drama's purpose) and keeps you settled on every casing, absorbing all the subtle elements and envisioning the following move. The delightful, yet grievous Misa is an alternate holder of a Death Note, and gets to be woefully captivated by Light and loyally does his offering, while in the meantime debilitating his invulnerability to the team following him down.  
This is just inside the initial ten scenes or thereabouts. This arrangement is basic enough for anybody to see, however in the meantime profound enough and cunning enough for those searching for something truly substantial to sink their teeth into. Moreover, this arrangement offers something that relatively few different arrangement do- -an ethical problem. Consider the possibility that we had a Death Note. Would we utilize it? How would we utilize it? Is it true that it is conceivable to utilize it without transforming into what Light gets to be?  
Its creation qualities abandon me with nothing to grumble about. A top-offering arrangement like Death Note, in the same way as Nana and other well known manga titles, have a commitment to its fans to provide for them something that is quality work. The activity is smooth, the character plans are steadfast and truly bring life to the characters. The music is awesome, and some of anime's top seiyuu are among the cast. You truly can't have a better arrangement. What's more this is originating from a Christian- -I am not in any way annoyed by this arrangement, it is a phenomenal philosophical and religious situation.  
What about taking a gander at this arrangement as social analysis? Any side of the political range or anybody with any sort of religious connection can discover interesting issue issues that make for phenomenal discourse. This is an arrangement that will make you think. It's more than simply latent diversion, however it is simply what you make it. That is the magnificence of Death Note. What's more luckily, it sparkles splendidly through the offensiveness that is without a doubt to go to its characters. Enjoyment has to be --/-- for me and I would recommend anybody to watch this.

Like the top review says, the summary is extremely misleading. 
That being covered, below are my thoughts after painfully going through the entire series. Also, I have only watched the show and not played the game.  
I was extremely confused by the ending since it made no logical sense and the storyline was basically crammed in the last few episodes. The girl stops the bad guy from being selfish....just to be equally selfish! It was mind-baffling since her selfishness wasn't for a greater cause.  
I also hated the ending for multiple reasons:  
-. The ending events occur because she falls in love with a person she has only known for a brief period of time >.> NO DEVELOPMENT = NO SYMPATHY from me 
-. The girl is stupid (has like the IQ of a bird, though the birds in this show are smarter than her), has no substantial thoughts and doesn't think for herself or for the world, makes no logical decisions, only acts based on other's commands or suggestions, and mainly acts based on how she's ""feeling"" or ""what her heart tells her."" 
Now for my rant - WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! 
I'm so confused as to why Resetting one last time was a bad idea. They should have just done it - like who cares, it just your useless life for mankind's survival. You're not that important!  
Also, you don't want to Reset because you're afraid of a life without a guy you literally met at most a month ago?!  
-. You're going to forget him so it's not like it matters.  
-. You're used to being alone and I bet you killed your family with your power so it shouldn't be a big deal for you to start over with knowing no one or if you died.  
-. If you never had substantial thoughts in your head before the Reset, keep it that way and don't think that your thoughts are important. 
Stupid, stupid girl! How in the hell did you survive by yourself for all those years?! Ugh, the mc is so frustrating! Do you not understand everyone is going to die one day anyway?! Why does it matter when you die, if it's going to happen? So what if you die before your time? It's not like you have company in death - everyone is going to die by themselves.  
This is why I hate people who think with their hearts only and think that they'll find their one true love aka the reason behind their reason to live. People like you are the reason why history repeats itself and humans don't progress philosophically.

(Review is spoiler-free.) 
The agonizing wait for a good vanilla yuri anime has ended. Asagao to Kase-san brilliantly delivers a finely crafted lesbian love story, with romance and drama blended in perfect proportion. 
Vanilla yuri fans have had a rough time when it comes to original anime or adaptations. Although there have been tons of series with undertones of lesbian relationships, outright and/or serious lesbian romance hasn't really graced anime since Sasameki Koto and Aoi Hana (----) or Sakura Trick (----). With the recent advent of adaptations of derivative yuri series Netsuzou Trap and Citrus, I had hoped that this would herald a revival in good old vanilla yuri romance. 
And it did with this fantastic OVA. Let's talk about it. 
The story in itself isn't anything special or new. Two girls fall in love with each other - one is more experienced, the other incredibly naive - and they go through the highs and the lows of their relationship. The first couple of scenes establish their relationship very quickly (thank goodness), so the rest of the anime focuses on the nuances of an already established romance. It is wonderfully paced, giving the viewer balanced proportions of sweet fluff and substantial drama and conflict in turns. The conflicts come up very organically and feel very natural in the course of the characters' relationship, and they're interspersed with sweet scenes that paint the relationship with further detail. The climax of the story is nothing new, but it was built up and executed well. As a result, the anime is a very tidy hour-long package, smoothly summarizing multiple volumes of the manga in a well-paced and well-executed manner. 
The OVA is finely crafted, with excellent art style, music, and voice acting. The characters look and sound incredible, and animation is excellent - you can feel the emotions displayed by the characters from the screen. Music comes up appropriately and with impact, further tempering the mood being expressed in the scenes. Such great execution was very critical to enjoying the story being presented in this OVA. 
I actually do not share the complaints of this OVA being too short or not covering enough material. It covered very pertinent strains of the manga and stands alone very well as a fantastic summary of the series. In fact, I had not read the manga before watching this and had a very effortless viewing experience despite my lack of prior knowledge. 
If Asagao to Kase-san is any indication of what the future holds for vanilla yuri romance, I am incredibly excited. What the OVA lacks in novelty it more than makes up with solid execution of a high-quality vanilla yuri plot, making for a highly enjoyable romantic anime.

I really enjoyed this anime, I thought the plot is really good, I was hooked from episode one and would happily watch it all over again. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes Comedy, Fantasy, Romance and Historical anime. I think this anime should have more confidence. The music and sounds are very interesting as they have traditional Japanese instruments, which I really like. The shows main female character(Shuurei) is very strong with a real sense of girl power which very different from most anime I have seen. The rest of the main of the characters all had very good background stories. Overall I really loved this anime and I hope other people will enjoy it as much I as I did.

Ok before i start this is my -st review 
Firstly here is a brief summary of Re:zero 
Re:zero is about male protagonist Natsuki Subaru (voiced by Kobayashi, Yuusuke) who is an -- year old NEET who gets transported in to another world, (quite a common setting in a majority of anime however with a unique twist) after a visit to the convenience store, he is later saved by a beautiful silver haired elf after being mugged by a group of street thugs, he gets to know his savior who names herself Satella for a bit until they are both killed. However unknowingly Subaru has the ability ""Return by Death"" to go back in time and change the future event from ever happening. 
Story(-): Now the story is mainly focused on Subaru attempting to save his savior(Emilia) from dieing and later on helping her achieve her goal however she doesn't really show much gratitude as Subaru is still a kind of stranger to her who she helped when he was in need, nothing more, nothing less, there is isn't a lot of sceentine for Emilia however she us seen quite a bit early on and definitely near the end. 
WARNING! 
There are many waifu's so be prepared for the MAL salt. 
Art(-): The scenary in this anime is amazing in my opinion, every scene is appealing to the eyes and the art is overall spectacular though a few parts may look a bit low near the end due to saving budget for specific scenes but are still not really anything to be salty about. 
Sound(--): This is one of my favorites, the music in this especially the OSTS are amazing, they all fit the moment and are perfectly used, the OPs and EDs are catchy and the anime has many soundtracks made just for a moment in the episode and are one of my favorites. 
Characters(--): The character development is done very well and you can tell how much the MC, main and quite a few supporting characters grow, this anime focuses quite a bit on the supporting cast which is what i love, especially Whilhem Van Astrea, Felis and Crusch, the voice actors do a magnificent job especially in those emotional scenes, you can really feel the character's pain and suffering, Betelgeuse is the best VA of the year no doubt about that. 
Enjoyment(--): I loved this series from start to finish, it did not feel rushed what so ever and i have already rewatched this series - times and counting. I would definitely reccomend this anime especially to those who love a dark fantasy thriller setting. 
(According to LN readers this is only the prologue -----% of the story) 
So expect a second season in a few years time. 
Overall(--): Personally this have been one of my favorite anime's of all time, everything is done so well and im really impressed at how well the VAs have done, definitely in my top - anime of all time. 
THIS IS NOT SAME AS SAO WHAT SO EVER! 
For the people who relate this masterpiece to trash, i don't know what is the same or how it even feels the same, everything you here about this being a a generic harem with plain characters is all bs from the haters, i recommend ignoring them and for you to personally enjoy it, if you don't fair enough but don't be a troll like the others. 
Thanks for reading, let me know if you enjoyed my first review, id be happy to do more.

Working’!! is exactly like Working!! but with an added apostrophe to confuse you. It has the same thirteen episode set up with the same characters, same restaurant, and same jokes. What I’m trying to get at is the fact that this review will be fairly tiny because there’s really not a lot that can be said about this second season of the series that I did not say in my previous review of Working!!. 
The story is the same as before with Souta helping to cure Mahiru’s androphobia while working at a family restaurant operated by a big group of misfits. It runs in a somewhat episodic way, with some overflow into the future episodes. That said, that’s about all I need to say. There is not a lot of story being dished out, or anything too complex anyway. Each episode ranges from fun and entertaining to boring and slow. These are especially prevalent around the points with Mahiru, who I complained about previously, and I shall complain about again. While I must commend the series for not making her the focal point and showcasing the others a lot more, she was still really prevalent and out of all the characters she is one of the worst. Thankfully, my prayers were answered and the cute romance between Jun and Yachiyo gets a lot more screen time and, while not going anywhere (just like every romance and major plot point of the series), still gives the characters added depth and a much more realistic feel than any of the others. The biggest plot aside from the androphobia concerns a guy looking for his sister. He’s not a particularly interesting or funny character, and this plot goes nowhere. Which is the problem with the series is that it just doesn’t develop. And there is a reason for this, that being Working!! is based on a comic strip which is the reason they use the same gags again and again and the characters never develop. So I guess I can be somewhat lenient based on that fact, but at the same time I feel that somebody should have taken the initiative and said something about tying up the romances or plots and at least ending the series with a bit of a bow on top. Instead it ends like any other episode and hopes I’ll return. Does this mean I can expect a season three called Working’,!! or is it just a tease like most anime endings? Time will tell I guess. 
The animation is once again pretty unsubstantial. It’s good, but it’s not anything that will make you say “wow”. Character designs aren’t that fantastic and memorable. 
The sound is okay. The theme song for this season is not as catchy as the previous one, and the ending isn’t as great either. The sound during the show fits perfectly fine. 
For more on characters, please refer to my previous review. Which makes me sound lazy, but I’d feel lazier if I copy and pasted the exact words about each of the characters in this spot. Everyone is the same. There are no differences and no character development so you don’t have to worry about me saying anything. Once again, Maya Matsumoto, the self-proclaimed “Normal girl” returns with lines during the last episode, but remains a mute throughout, though can be seen in the background. She actually works with the crew in the last episode and seems to have some sort of relationship with all of them, but yet she is never used throughout to instill a sense of normality in the show. It doesn’t feel right for a character who has been there to magically have lines the last episode and become part of the plot. It’s like someone forgot about her up to that point and then quickly wrote her into the script. 
Yeah, this review is very short by my standards, but it’s the best I can really do without copy and pasting my review of the previous season. If you liked Working!!, you’ll love this season. It’s not really an improvement, though the shift of focus from androphobia is a big part of what makes this season slightly better, but it is a good addition to the franchise. Will there be more episodes? Who knows. Will I welcome them? Sure I will, but I don’t know how willingly. While I enjoy the occasional comedy/slice of life adventure, there has to be some development and growth and Working’!! doesn’t provide either. As it progresses, it grows staler with the same brand of comedy and the same pointless romances that go in circles. It started off fun and felt like it may go somewhere and continue to entertain, but the problem is it starts to flatline. With the occasional good episode and the typical average ones, it never seems to find its stride and only occasionally makes a joke that is laugh-worthy, because all the others we have heard previously. 
Overall, Working’!! is a step in the right direction, but the entity taking that step is growing old and tired and needs to be rested before it can go any further. If there were to be a third season, there would have to be a sense of freshness that this anime rarely provides.

Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it.  
Story:  
Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It's powerful. It's grabbing. It does everything an introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story's credibility at times.  
Art: 
Art is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone's own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is ""good"" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland.  
Sound: 
Finally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series's soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime.  
Characters:  
The main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character's obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don't like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa's obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist.  
Enjoyment: 
Now we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you're looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you're looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime.  
With a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a -/-- in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.

I like Takagi I like the embarrassed expression Nishikata I like everything. When you imagine if it happens in every day, I can only smile to myself :u have a nosy girlfriend with wide forehead xD 
Ohh I hope I do not get to my own imagination :- 
If you ask the scene I love the most in this anime is when Takagi blusshed, yeah I really like the innocence of Nishikata who do not understand at all about it. 
You know, if Nishikata had pretty much defeated Takagi, it's just that he did not realize it. 
To the point this anime is very very cool.

Not even artwork in the case of Dungeon ni Deai can be a savior fact, as I've already seen animes of ---- or even less with better artwork. Everything in this anime is simply terrible. The characters' development are mediocre, and you can't even enjoy the series quite well as everything inside it sucks. Perhaps the only good thing is this anime was Bell fighting the minotaur... Nothing else. 
By watching Sword Oratoria, I tend to think even more than I already thought before, that Ais Wallestein shoulda been the main protagonist. Seriously, I don't read the manga or stuffs like these to see if Bell Crannel's story can actually be far interesting, but if it's, it was poorly adapted. I think the company would have earned more if they started the anime with Wallestein's story, as it is way more explained, and far more developed than this sorryful excuse of anime. I had dropped it long time ago, and I regret myself cotinuing it. I'm sorry if I'm being too harsh, but perhaps even Yosuga no Sora has more story than this, and I'm not even kidding. 
If you want to watch something interesting related to this, go watch Dungeon ni Deai: Sword Oratoria. It is supposed to be a side story, showing what was happening to Ais whilst she wasn't near Bell Crannel. But it's far, far more interesting, and the story is way more developed and explained. I never thought I'd been writing about an anime saying it's original content is surpassed by a side story, but in the case of Dungeon ni Deai, it is. Enjoy yourself with it, and not this sorry excuse of anime we have here. 
PS: However, even so, Sword Oratoria has some flaws as well. Firstly some unnecessaries yuri scenes, and secondly, it develops well only from episode -- onwards. But even so, give it a shot! I bet you won't regret.

Usagi drop is an incredibly heartwarming story of a man loving a young girl as if he were her daughter. Raising a kid alone is hard! But Daikichi loves Rin enough to take her in and love her like she is his own child. 
STORY: 
The background story of Daikichi's grandfather having an illegitimate child is interesting. Since this show is a slice of life there is not much plot to the show, but what I can say is that following Daikichi and Rin going about their lives is so much fun to watch. 
CHARACTERS: 
There is little development of characters but that's what I expect from a slice of life. Rin and Daikichi's relationship is so sweet and heartwarming. Rin is literally the cutest! She cares for Daikichi and others which I love about her. 
ART: 
Great art and animation! 
SOUNDS: 
Good voice acting. I loved the OP and ED songs!! The OP song is now one of my favorite anime OPs! 
FINAL THOUGHTS: 
This is the kind of show that gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside when you watch it. You can see how much Daikichi and Rin love and care for each other which is amazing. This show has rightfully earned it's place as on of my favorite animes. --/-- for me!

Akira has been lamented as a work of pure genius and one of the most important works in the medium. It has also been criticized for its supposedly overly complex plot and gratuitous violence. It has been called revolutionary. It has been called disgusting. It has been called beautiful. It has been called overrated. I am just one man, so I can't give you all the answers, but I can tell you one thing. 
I really fucking love this movie. 
I've seen it, in total, three times. Each time brings a new level of understanding to the film. The plot is very complex and will probably take you at least two viewings to truly grasp what transpired over it's two hour runtime.  
It's set in Tokyo, after a catastrophic event leveled the city thirty one years earlier. It's been rebuilt into a dystopia ran by corrupt politicians. The streets are a war zone, as terrorists and protesters launch attacks daily. The city is destroying itself from the inside out. Not only that, but the government has been conducting experiments in an attempt to control extremely powerful psychic beings, who caused the damn destruction of the city in the first place. All of this, mixed in with a group of teenagers in the wrong place at the wrong time, creates a very complex and multi-faceted plot. 
I've heard the manga is very long and a lot of it had to be condensed into one film, and you can see a bit of strain here and there. Some plot lines aren't as fleshed out as others, some characters who seem to hold importance only make brief appearances. Despite all of this, the film really excels with its philosophical and intellectual themes and at its core, a story of two friends torn apart by the circumstances that be. 
There are quite a bit of characters in the film, from the military Colonel who only wants to save his city, to the mad scientist intent on learning the ""secrets of the universe"". Due to the limited running time, a lot of characters are only thing archetypes and don't get much development. This is a shame, but it doesn't really detract from the overall experience. 
Besides the Colonel (who is a very awesome character, if you ask me), only two other characters really have depth. That would be Kaneda and Tetsuo, two life-long friends who are forced to turn against each other. Tetsuo in particular, as his character is morphed into something completely different from when the film starts.  It's intriguing to watch as their relationship changes over the course of the film. 
Artistically, Akira is a marvel, especially for its time. The sheer detail in the sprawling, mangled cityscapes is particularly beautiful. Every shot has exquisite detail; it's crazy thinking about how much work went into this film. The film's look matches the dystopian setting perfectly. While the art is great, it's the animation that really excels. Every motion is extremely fluid and blends together realistically. The lip movements are perfectly synced to the voices as well (which is kind of rare, in my experience).  
The only detractors are the rather bland character designs. Several of the characters (especially the teenagers) have similar looking faces and it can sometimes be hard to tell them apart. It's a small problem, but I felt like it was worth mentioning nonetheless. 
The soundtrack is a booming behemoth of a creature. Industrial beats and ravaged, breathy chants blend together well, complementing the grotesque mood of the film. The sound effects are good as well, it captures the whirring of the motorcycles and the explosive action sequences well.  
The first two times I watched the film, I selected the English audio track. For the most recent viewing, I decided to use the Japanese audio track. While the English was pretty good overall, the film benefits from its native language. I felt like I understood the film better with the subtitles, honestly. Hey, though, it's up to you on which audio track you want to listen to. 
As for my personal enjoyment, I find this film to be incredibly entertaining. I hear the word ""boring"" getting thrown around a lot with this film, and I completely disagree. It has visually stunning actions sequences, a complex plot with many themes, good character interaction, and an ending that is still being interpreted to this day. Is it perfect? No, of course not. The plot can seem a little strained at times, and some characters are underdeveloped. You know what though? I honestly do not care. The film enraptured me from start to finish.  
And you've gotta admit, Kaneda's bike is badass.

The Positive Side: It isn’t difficult to see why Hellsing Ultimate is popular.  The artwork and action are superb, with loads of stylish characters duking it out with unique magical weapons and powers.  As a horror series, Hellsing isn’t shy about pouring on the gore, and the gruesome deaths and gleefully sadistic villains—not to mention the monstrous protagonist, Alucard, himself—are sure to haunt your dreams and make your flesh creep. 
You’d be forgiven for brushing the show off as simply a blood-soaked thriller, but Hellsing is quite a bit smarter than it looks.  As the show transitions from an action-horror to a war story, more vulnerable, mortal characters begin to take the stage, and we get a glimpse into the nature of honor and morality in times of war. 
The show tends to shift art-styles during comedic moments, which can be a bit disruptive, but the jokes have a way of catching you off-guard that makes the humor much more effective. 
Hellsing is sometimes accused of lacking a sophisticated plot, but personally, I’ve never felt these accusations ring true.  There’s a lot of political tension between Hellsing and Escariot, the rival undead-hunting organizations, and there’s a delight in the creativity and thoughtfulness the main villain exhibits in his plot to slay the seemingly unslayable Alucard. 
The exciting visuals and inventive fight scenes are supplemented by a solid soundtrack utilizing both classical music and heavy metal.  The show also uses authentic Nazi marches during a gruesome attack on London, to chilling effect.  In the visual and auditory departments, there is no doubt that Hellsing is a success. 
The Negative Side: While Hellsing certainly has its virtues, there is a lot wrong with this anime. 
The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever heard or read, with nearly every character spouting melodramatic diatribes and incoherent mixed metaphors at the drop of hat.  It’s bad enough that the eccentric Nazi leader talks this way, but why the hell do a bunch of ill-mannered mercenaries sound like they’re cribbing lines from a ---year-old girl’s poetry book?  Not only is everyone’s dialogue painfully corny and pompous, but nobody in this show is capable of shutting the fuck up.  Once a character starts talking, you can expect them to keep going for the next ten minutes, repeating themselves in every way imaginable, making vague statements and stalling for time until the director is confident the episode will reach its required fifty minute length.  I ended up hating the Major more for his tendency to monologue than for the fact that he was a Nazi. 
The protagonist, Alucard, spends half the series stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and the sad part is that this half of the show is vastly better than the half where he’s actually on-screen.  When your protagonist is so overpowered that you can’t create dramatic tension without side-lining him, something has gone horribly wrong. 
While the artwork on its own is great, the camera has an annoying tendency to flash between perspectives, abruptly focusing on weapons or facial expressions before jumping back to the original shot.  It feels like this was supposed to seem cool and dramatic, but it doesn’t accomplish anything other than giving the audience a headache. 
Hellsing is a decent show if you like horror or action series, and despite its horrendous dialogue, it has more than a few emotionally powerful moments.  It’s definitely worth a look, but don’t expect it to live up to its reputation.

First off I must say, Hotarubi no Mori e had me bawling like a baby lol. That is all I will say on that note because I do not want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it. Now keep in mind, this review is just my opinion of this anime. Also, this is my first review, so please keep this in mind lol. 
Hotarubi no Mori e is one of the most beautiful animes I have ever seen. It is absolutely breathtaking. 
Regarding the Art: 
This anime has some of the most amazing art I have seen in an anime. The colors are very intense, but not too overwhelming. I love the body styles of the characters. I am not personally fond of artwork such as in xxxHolic. I do not like thin, lanky characters. However, I realize this is just my opinion. But I find the characters beautiful in Hotarubi no Mori e. Although Gin's face is not often shown, he is a very attractive character (is that strange to say? lol). 
Regarding the Sound: 
I am not sure if there is a dubbed version of this anime or not, but I personally generally watched subbed versions of all the anime I watch. In Hotarubi no Mori, I think they chose wonderful voice actors. They have very soothing voices, which goes well with the mood of this movie. 
Regarding the Characters: 
The character development is brilliant, especially considering that this movie is only around forty five minutes long. I grew extremely attached to the characters. I personally even loved seeing the other spirits in the forest. Of course, my favorite thing about the characters was the interaction between Hotaru and Gin. It is very unique to watch a love story unfold where one starts out as a child and eventually catches up to the other in age. It was precious to see how Gin treated her, especially as a child. And watching them eventually fall in love was wonderful to see. I had a smile on my face for the majority of this anime. 
Overall: 
Overall, this anime was absolutely brilliantly created. The creators did a beautiful job. This is definitely an anime that I will re-watch (which I normally don't do). Although I personally wish it ended differently (that is all I will say), I still greatly appreciate the beauty of it. The plot, character development, artwork, and sound were all incredible. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that likes anime. I also feel that this anime would be a good idea to show to someone that has never seen anime before. 
It has an average score of -.- for a reason. It greatly deserves a -/--. If you haven't watched it yet, drop everything right now and go watch it immediately!

The plot of this anime begins very solid. I was convinced it would quickly become a favourite, despite White getting on my nerves from time to time. Had I gotten to know the characters better, I probably could have continued to feel for them. However, the plot quickly goes from being clever and direct, to warped about an hour or so in. For those who enjoy violent anime, I'm sure there are better ones, but for me this was pretty high-strung. I will saw this for the characters though, but the second half you REALLY feel their anger (thus showing the strength of their voice actors as well as their animators).  
Being a fairly sensitive person, that began to wear on me, but for many who are of a thicker skin, you will likely find the reasons behind the violence somewhat touching and/or heroic. 
The second aspect to draw me in was the incredible art style of the anime. The creators made a really colourful, interesting world of Treasure Town (the clocktower in the most obvious that comes to mind), to the point that you begin to want to visit it. That kind of unique tangibility can really make an anime, and this one managed to do so exceedingly well. 
The characters are strong, only in that they feed so well off one another. However, as I have said before, I didn't tend to feel much for the characters, which hindered my ability to worry much about them. The fundamentals are there, but it's a pretty noisy film, with a lot of drama to keep up with - even without the surrealistic aspects of the latter half - which takes away from my interest in the characters. I did find myself interested in the blind &quot;seer&quot; homeless man who has befriended Black &amp; White, as well as the Inspector and Suzuki.  
This music is what first drew me into the film (I was already a large fan of theirs), and it continued to be the guiding light for this feature. The voice acting is another prize. The only reason I think I feel anything for the characters was due to how they sound. Even the English cast wasn't bad - a rarity for most anime, except perhaps those of an early Viz Video fair. I'd say the sound and art is what truly made this film stand out from others, especially its peers. 
While I enjoyed the film, I felt there wasn't enough of it explained, even by anime standards. However, the art is incredible, the story is good and you grow interested in the characters fairly quickly. This should definitely fall in the &quot;Mind trip&quot; category with films like Mind Walk, Paprika, Lain and the like. It is slightly disorienting at times, but the overall message manages to get through. Good re-watchability value, because I suspect more will become clearer that way. I recommend the original source be read beforehand in order to gain some insight into the storyline.

How can anyone say that Mars of destruction is the worst anime ever if we have THIS on the site??? 
It was such a wast of time watching this ""anime"" that I'm at a loss for words, I don't even know what else to say... 
I don't even know why this is ""horror"", I only felt that it was bad while watching it, it got me thinking: ""wth am I doing watching this?"" 
I can't even begin to understand how something so short can be such a waste of time. 
The only thing I can do is say: 
If you read this: Don't watch this 
Or watch, wathever 
But it will be a waste of time

So I jumped in to this anime with neutral opinions and hoping for a show with at least a sub par plot with decent char development. 
Yeah... Turns out you get that with - minute out of a --+ per episode. Then followed up by more ""Nii-san no baaakaa!"" 
The plot is intriguing at start, and char was a mystery and something to make me wonder and want to know more about them. But by ep- thing's get stale as the plot is as common as sand is in the Caribbean. And the characters just gradually gets stale along with their development for me to personally care or want to know. I can't say more about it as I do not want to proceed with the next episode wasting my weekend of trying to finish this series.  
Though we do get good songs out of it by Claris. And praises to A- pictures with their beautiful artstyle is a given so kudos for the sound and art. 
Truth be told, I was warned about this anime. I was warned.

I started watching this anime because it sounded more or less interesting. 
I hoped for a good plot, but most importantly for hot, sexy, young vampires. 
I was glad that I got at least something, and that is my friends the second part. 
The plot is.. I mean.. very disappointing. I really expected something more.  
Frankly, I personally like to see anime well done, I like to see characters well made, so as plot, it doesn't have to be good, at least fairly done. 
Here, in diabolik lovers all you have is blood sucking and hot vampires lying around.I didn't enjoy it. It is  watchable, but only once.  
I wouldn't recommend this  to any of my friends to watch, because I was not impressed in any way.  
Of course, that's my opinion, perhaps someone else sees something that I don't in this anime, perhaps someone enjoyed watching it, etc.  
But I can only say that if you don't care about the story that much and you like vampires, blood, violence and hot hot anime boys.. this is the right anime  :)

Probably the most boring main protagonist i've ever seen in an anime. The girl with the Japanese themed clothes has an obnoxious habit of saying gozaru on her last sentences every single time, which is really annoying. The fight scene are bland and generic, didn't really like the art either. The story is just as boring as the main protagonist, some scenes just doesn't make any sense like for example in the first episode in the alley, why would the twin sisters go to a dark alley just to do a simple item transaction, are they selling crack too as a side job? Because that's where a crack dealer would probably sell their stuff.

Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is an interesting anime giving you a new perspective on the OP main character trope. 
The anime spends very little time establishing the strength of koro-sensei and instead focuses on character development.  
We see kids who seem to have lost all hope in E class and we see their development through interactions with koro-sensei. 
My one and only gripe with the anime is the lack of character development for some of the characters. It's to the point where I am going 'oh yeah I forgot about him/her'. I know I shouldn't be annoyed but it ruins the entire feel of E class all coming together if you only know half of them.

Oh my, I cannot say enough good things about this anime. 
I actually watched the anime first before reading the manga; I watched it, fell in love, and had to find out if there was more so went a-searching (lucky for you all, the manga is continuing... I am desperately waiting for a second season but until then, I read on!). 
First and foremost, this falls under the horror category, and it is spectacular in that aspect. It is one of the only anime (that I could find) that focuses on paranormal research in the aspect that you might see on TV (Ghost Hunters, Destination Truth, etc (think Ghostbusters!)) but with a true horror, chill-down-your-spine feeling to it. 
The anime, like the manga, is split into a few episodes that span over specific cases the company encounters. And let me tell you, there were two cases in particular that did NOT let me sleep well at night.  
The story is case-based, meaning, the anime focuses on the cases that come through to the Shibuya Psychic Research Company. Only near the end of the anime do you begin to learn more of the main characters' background story. 
Normally, I would like more character development but what is special in this anime is that the cases are so interesting, you get wrapped up in each episode. There are also moments of light, comedic moments that make you laugh but the chill factor with the episodic villains (the paranormal ghoulies) temper that comedy perfectly. You finish an episode and want to turn on the light (that tells you, you have a good horror story in your hands). I also like that we learn about the characters through their interactions with each other than back-flashes to the past or something like that. 
The art is great and lets face it, there are many bishies in this one (Kazuya FTW). The music though is one of my favorites. The opening theme was so good, I have the OST now. Both the opening and ending themes give you a perfect creep factor that lingers after any episode. Also, the sound effects for those scare moments really get to you. If you get the doll or Urado episode, good luck. Scared me out of my damn mind (every time I watch it!). 
I love a good horror story. And this is actually my hands down favorite horror animes. I love that it's different from all the others. For this anime, it's not a gore factor that makes it scary, it's the thought behind it, the story behind the horror, and that makes me love it all the more. 
Watch it. You'll love it. And you'll stalk the manga while waiting for an announcement for a hopeful second season (we really need more manga for that, really....).

Following the events of Marineford, Luffy is in the midst of training with Rayleigh when a pirate by the name of Burndy World arises after escaping from Impel Down. With the intent of kidnapping one of the seven warlords, World ends up taking Boa Hancock's sisters as hostage. Luffy and Hancock team up to take down Burndy World and save Hancock's sisters.  
Story: - 
From the original synopsis, I was under the impression that this would be a movie depicting Boa as a damsel in distress for Luffy to come and rescue from the hands of an evil pirate. I was so pleased that this was not the case. In fact, quite contrarily, Luffy and Boa made a great team going up against the bad guys.  
If I am completely honest, the beginning of this movie did not sit well with me. The first fifteen minutes are almost entirely of flashbacks, and while I understand that it is necessary to show the events that occurred prior to this film, it was both rushed and simultaneously felt too slow. Going through Ace's death felt like I was fast-fowarding through a tape, because it was very quick scene after scene with not much transition between them. Then we go through a sequence of showing each of the Straw Hat Pirates that ultimately took up more time than I would have liked.  
Following this, the build up to the actual events felt slow and altogether boring to me. I was thinking that this was going to be a flop of a movie, but about midway through the plot begans to pick up. And WOW did it pick up. The entire film went from being so-so to straight up amazing.  
It's better that I don't talk about the plot any more so as not to give away spoilers. There is a lot that happens and it's well worth watching for yourself.   
Art: - 
It's not uncommon for One Piece movies to try different art styles. This one reminded me a bit of the -th One Piece “Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island” movie, but not quite as flat. In this, there was great detail when needed, and even dabbled a bit with -D and computer looking effects. It took me a few minutes to adjust to the new style, but once I became familiar with it I was able to sit back and enjoy it for what it was.  
The movement in this movie was phenomenal. It always felt like there was something going on, even when characters were merely talking to each other. Anywhere from hair to clothes to their bodies in mid-fight, it was great to see the effort put into making the simple lines on a screen come to life.  
Sound: - 
All of the voice actors did a great job and played their roles perfectly. As always, I can count on the cast to act their hearts out and bring powerful emotion to the characters. And in this movie, which actually dealt quite a bit with deeper emotions, the voice actors really impressed me.  
The reason why I give sound a -, however, is because the music used within the movie was not new and did not give much to the scene in the ways that I would want. The music, especially during a final battle, should not just be background noise, it should amplify and add a whole new layer to the scene. The music sort of faded into the background, and, I noticed, was just the same music that we have heard a hundred times in the show before. I would have loved to hear entire new compositions made for this movie, but sadly I was not given that.  
Character: -- 
Here's where the movie truly did an outstanding job.  
We all know Luffy's character; we know he is a goof and sometimes an idiot, but we also know that he is loyal to his friends and he cares about others. In the show, we never did see the events that took place right after Ace's death or see how that might affect him. This film touched on that aspect in several instances, and it's evident that Ace's death is a burden that still weighs him down. I liked seeing that because it is not something we often see in his character. It is a main impact in Luffy's life to know that despite his efforts he was unable to save his brother. However, we don't really see that impact upon him because the show skipped over - years entirely, during which we can assume Luffy was given the time to accept, or at the least come to terms with, his brother's passing. In this film, Ace's death is still fresh in his mind, and Luffy is struggling with it periodically for the duration of the movie, especially when it is brought up by others. This point of the plot didn't overtake the rest of the events, but I really enjoyed seeing how it was an addition to the story and an addition to Luffy's character.  
Boa Hancock is as wonderful as ever. She practically has a split personality, just like in the show, where she is either the pirate empress who uses her beauty and strength to kill her foes, or she is a lovesick puppy who is obsessed with Luffy. She was an enjoyable addition to the movie and I loved seeing her.  
Those were the two main characters of the movie, but we had a myriad of others, and surprisingly all of whom I really enjoyed.  
The main villains of this movie were Burndy World and his companions. I never thought I would be so invested in the back-stories of these villains, but I truly was. Their history was compelling and interesting and the character development seen between them is fascinating. I cared more about the villains than I ever thought I would. Of all the bad guys we've seen throughout the One Piece movies, I would say these are the most interesting ones, or at the very least, the ones I cared the most about.  
Enjoyment: - 
There was so much to love about this movie. So many characters showed up that added new layers to an already well written film. The fighting was exciting, I was on the edge of my seat for the duration of each battle. There was a great build up to each fight, a great build up with each character, and much more.  
There were flaws of course, no movie is perfect. And like I mentioned before, the first half was a bit of a let down for me, but the second half made up for it and practically made me forget any doubts I had to begin with.  
Overall: - 
Next to Strong World, I would say this is one of the best One Piece movies we've had. Absolutely worth watching. If you enjoyed the Marineford arc, watch this movie. And if you didn't enjoy the Marineford arc, you would probably still like this movie if nothing else than just to watch Luffy and Boa kick ass and take down some bad guys.

You may already know that Dangan Ronpa is the anime adaption of a video game by the same name. 
You should also know it is the worse anime adaption of a game that was ever made. 
Despite having a great story, it is impossible to realize how good it is or even enjoy it in the anime because the pacing is absolutely horrible. Everything happens too fast and nothing is explained, especially during investigations. A lot of important information is lost. 
There is no character development, apart from things that are very important for the story. The lack of free times makes the characters bland. 
The animation is a disaster, not even still images have good art. For something called ""Dangan Ronpa: THE ANIMATION"" there sure very few of it. 
The only good thing about this adaption is the music. Why? Well the OST is the same one from the game (surprise!), and they actually did a good job with the ending. However I am not a fan of the changes they made to the opening song. 
I am still watching this anime for the sole reason that I have already played the whole game beforehand, so I know the story. I'm using the anime as ""extra footage"" to watch some situations from the game ""animated"" (altough there's not much animation in this anyway). 
Conclusion: Don't watch the anime, play the game. If you really want to watch it, do it after you've played the whole game. Please don't let the anime ruin a great story for you.

Grave of the Fire Flies is a dark, beautiful, and haunting film that will stick in your memory long after you finish watching it. 
The film has a lot to say about morality, family, responsibility, and much more. This is a film that shows off the worst aspects humans can sometimes have, and the humans that portray these aspects are not the ones you think they are going to be. What impressed me the most about this film is how war is portrayed. The word Americans, United States, USA, etc. are hardly ever, if at all, mentioned. This is a film that is more survival story than world war - film. There is a constant stream of bombs being dropped on our characters' home town, but I feel this film would be just as effective if our main characters were hit by a flood,  earthquake, or other natural disaster. 
Our main characters are constantly being presented with impossible choices, and though they don't always make the one that best ensure their survival, you can still understand and sympathize with every decision they make. 
Grave of the Fire Flies is a dark, depressing, and moving story that defies many of the more common story elements found in both survival stories and war films. An easy recommendation for anyone looking for a mature and well written story of survival.

Art: Fine. Character design is decent, faces are shaded (at least in close ups), objects and backgrounds are well drawn as well so no complaints here. A big annoyance is when Chiba's face is sometimes drawn with no shading other than under the nose and lower lip making her face look completely flat other than the aforementioned areas.  
Animation: Mostly double or triple framed with minimal single-framing that you probably can't even notice unless you went through it frame-by-frame like I did. Intense action scenes like the tentacle scene could really have done with single framing but I guess the budget couldn't allow for that. Overall the animation is not noticeably choppy so it's acceptable I guess.  
Choreography: What choreography lol. There are no fight scenes in this movie which is the biggest disappointment for me. Actually the dream sequences really let me down because I was expecting more lurid sequences and fight scenes but there were none. The only action consisted of Paprika running around to escape tentacles or whatever. Pretty boring.  
Conclusion: Not as good as I had been expecting. Dream sequences could have been more lurid, no fighting, very little violence. A shit ton of movie references for seemingly no reason other than ""the police guy didn't finish a movie that he was making with a friend"". Makes no sense. I didn't like Paprika, she seemed too artificial and forced. Chiba acted like a bitch. The fat genius guy also seemed too stereotyped. None of the characters were convincing at all. What's the theme of this story, really? Is it a beauty and the beast, as in, the fat genius as the beast, and Paprika as the beauty? Why is every male character in the movie madly in love with Paprika? The dream rape scene felt weird and out of place. In the novel Chiba actually does get raped, physically. That's pretty edgy dude. Thought this was supposed to be fun and not serious and adult. Oh well. That's what you get for thinking that popular = good.

Story - The anime has a rather simple story that is Ginko a mushi-shi travels to various parts helping people who have problems with creatures called mushi which are somewhat of a combination of plant/nature/animal. Each episode is a different story about Ginko helping people and there is no real ongoing plot. The main problem I had with the story is that they get very repetitive and about half way through the anime I had to take a break because I felt I was just rewatching the same episodes over again. A large portion of the episodes are about a woman and a man and one of them has disease or problem and tries to tie in a love into the problem which gets tiring after a while. This being said I did think the last five to six episodes were good. If you can stand repetitive plot lines then this should not bother you much. 
Art &ndash; There are two parts to the art here. First is the nature and drawings of the mushi. This was well done and fit into the series and was one of the better parts as well. The major flaw in the art style is that the minor characters look all very similar I honestly could not tell much difference between them. I though that they just got lazy, and only changed the hair style of the characters to make distinctions between the minor characters. All in all the art style was alright. 
Sound &ndash; There was nothing really outstanding about the sound that comes to mind. There were no real problems with the sound either. Over all the sound was pretty good and there is not much to talk about. 
Character &ndash; As I have said before I found it hard to distinguish the characters from each other. As for the character of the anime I did enjoy the fact that it was willing to take a different view for anime. The problem was that they could not make it different enough for me to get too into the anime. 
Enjoyment &ndash; If you could not figure it out yet I did not enjoy this anime. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that all the comments had said it was great or amazing and I was sadly disappointed. Another main reason was that I felt the lack of the anime making you want to see the next episode. Mushi-shi did not present much as to one wandering what will be next as most of the episodes ended similarly. I will say that if you are looking for something different and have not seen any anime about the relationship between people and nature that you would enjoy this anime.  
Overall &ndash; Overall I have seen better anime but I have also seen worse anime. I gave Mushi-shi a six only because of the lack of enjoyment and I felt I was suffering through watching it. I did how ever enjoy several of the last episodes as it attempted to recapture my interest. My last words if you are looking for something different in anime this might be worth checking out.

So for my first review EVER I decided to talk about Kiznaiver! It's a bit of a particular show, as it made me go from ""wow this show is so awesome!"" to ""oh god this is cringy and horribly written"" really quickly. This is why I decided to give it an average score. 
Story: -/-- 
There is not really any real plot to Kiznaiver, and that's why it is the weakest part of the show. There is one mini arc in the middle of the series that felt kind of satisfying, and the long overarching story which, quite frankly, makes no sense. Tons of things are left unexplained, and the ending, which could have tied up many loose ends, ended up rushed and nonsensical. When I finished this show, I couldn't really tell what it was about apart from badly written teenage drama.  
The story played around with many edgy and deep themes but failed to deliver it remarkably. Everything felt forced, from the awful dialogues which repeated the same things over and over again about ""pain"", ""feelings"", ""friends"" to the deus ex machina and the totally unrealistic science kiznaiver bullcrap (I know it's Trigger, but still). What started as a light hearted and kind of fun comedy evolved into an awful melodrama that got worse after each episode. I couldn't feel anything for the characters, because their problems just seemed so unimportant. ""Oh my god he/she doesn't love me let's make a scene"" <--- This happened maybe - times in the course of the last - episodes. I actually wondered if some of the scenes at the end were not written by --/-- years olds edgy teenagers with too many hormones, because this felt like it. 
Basically, ok start and middle, and a terrible ending. 
Art: --/-- 
I freaking love studio Trigger and its art. Can't find anything bad to say about the gorgeous palette of colours and the wonderful, natural flowing animations. The character designs were fun and remarkable. The visuals for the opening blew my mind the first time I watched it, and it was definitely the best visuals for an opening this season. 
Sound: -/-- 
I also loved the soundtrack. Wasn't really memorable (maybe because I only watched one episode a week), but amazing. The opening and ending were both incredible (the opening reminds me of the song Take On Me by a-ha, which I love.) 
Characters: -/-- 
This one is tricky to rate. At first, I was interested in all the characters. They were cliché, but well done. I was very curious about Hisomu, which was quite the enigmatic one and I loved Tenga and Chidori. 
Sadly, as the plot worsened, so did the characters. Tenga and Chidori became the two most annoying characters in this show, to the point where I couldn't even comprehend their tought process. Kacchon and Sonozaki, which were both mysterious, were developed the most, but with the way the dialogues were made I had trouble understanding what they felt. Hisomu, sadly, stayed as a comic relief character with a couple good scenes, and never got much depth to him. Nico, which I found a tad annoying at first, became the best character in the show for me. All in all, the characters had their good and bad moments. Most of the time, their reactions were not very realistic and felt forced. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
I really wanted to enjoy this show. The great soundtrack and pretty visuals helped me forget a bit about the convoluted plot and dialogues, but not enough. Some episodes were a drag, while others were really fun. The finale was  
Overall: -/-- 
This is not an horrible show per se, as it has a lot of redeeming features. If you are able to turn our brain off for a bit, or are into melodrama (I hate using that word that people use to diss actual good animes, but this is really what Kiznaiver is), then this show is for you.

English Subtitled 
Censored 
Story 
Slow but at the same time random. I am guessing it was a symbolical introduction. Illustrating the struggle for fitting in. 
Plot simple and short. Not original. 
Some of the wording along with art/animation was comical. 
Ending was romantic.  
Sound 
-Had a nice romantic song to go with at the time an alleged romance. 
- Illustrated voices from a distance well with echo distortion.  
Art 
Somewhat cheap in backgrounds for in introduction. Art there also seemed completely random.  As soon as the viewer could settle in something about the picture sometimes minor to major would up and go. 
Some of the characters were similar to another which made knowing what was happening slightly confusing. 
Overall one might come to the same conclusion as I. Artwork of characters demonstrate possible poor quality of production. For there is no by Japanese slang terminology cuteness. But I think the director was smart. If you read into plot you find story takes place for certain characters in far past. Beauty as we know today wouldn’t have existed back then. For little by little like everything we know such as strawberries has been broken down from things of dislike and expanded on areas of interest. Main complaint I had was the minor helper character. To me character should have made sense with a character of past by not being seen as a character of future. Although, when one lives for such a long period of time one with either adapt to current events or risk missing out on deadlines. In that sense I can understand.

I will not lie after I watched the movie  I was really shocked when I saw it has this high of  a score in MAL. This movie proved and reminded me of how people can think,like,and see different side of things. 
As you can tell I did't like the movie very much,but first I will talk about what I did like 
positives: 
--the first few part of the story I liked really much especially the opening seen. 
--the sound track was really good , nothing memorable but it gave you a good atmosphere. 
--the design of the main heroine was good,i find her really cute. She is also one of the only good characters in this movie in my opinion, more on that later.  
--the art of was really really good. 
--the relationship between the two main character was really amazing.  
Negatives: 
I have a lot of negative things to say and I will try my best not to spoil any thing. 
--this movie has two major plots ,one about the relationship between the main two characters and one about the kingdom and the king and what ever ,i think both of those ideas  should've been their own movie , I don't think the two ideas go will together. 
--the main male character is really stupid and I don't think he make sense at all. 
--the story goes in a really strange way ,it starts slow then some action happen then it return to the slow bass.(this point was not so much of a negative but it was kinda annoying ) 
--and finally my biggest problem with this movie, the final arc.i will just say this arc ruined the movie for me,there is a lot of things to say about the final arc but I will not talk about it to avoid spoiling the movie.

Death parade is an excellent adaptation of the project Death Billiards, 
It has an amazing story and each character has their own personality. 
I love the opening (even though it might be a little too happy) 
The writers leave a lot to the imagination of the viewers and with this anime, that works really well. 
You uncover little pieces of the story yourself while watching. 
Some of the characters stay a big mystery but the main characters go through a lot and you will see them evolve throughout the story. 
If you aren't good with sad anime then this anime is probably a little too much. 
I hope they will make a second season of this!

I finished the entire season in order to give the show a chance but it's just not good.  
The Story: 
It's about a shit ton of girls trying to become an idol. There's really not much to go on except for that.  
The Characters: 
Probably the majority of the reason why I didn't like the show was because of the poor characters. Seriously, a big cast like that and all of them are very one dimensional. These girls had poor personality, unmemorable and over all not relatable. The problem with a ---episode show with a huge cast is that not everyone will be developed by the end of the season. I mean what are their motivations? They want to become an idol but why? And why is Rin so fucking emo? 
The Music: 
The music was okay. Like the characters, it wasn't memorable but it was decent none the less.  
Finally, this was being compared to Love Live? Yeah I don't think so. Not even close to Love Live. (Don't get me wrong. Im not part of the fandom. I'm just observing and being honest. )

Metropolis is a movie doing everything wrong. And I am not talking about the production values, which are great by the way. I am referring to the aesthetics, a complete mess of ideas and sceneries that strike a chord in all the wrong places and moments. It could definitely be a fine title, if it was aware of the way it presented itself. It could be great if it was: 
-) a series instead of a movie. It has a very heavy on themes story yet only movie-worth of duration to show them. This obviously takes away a lot from what it could have been if more time was invested in each of its numerous aspects. 
-) a lot more character-centric instead of story-centric. You are not made to believe that any one of its characters has the tiniest control over their actions. They are more like being pulled through events set in stone they can’t do anything about. There is also very little time invested one each one of them to feel like they are at least trying to do something significant in general. This tends to make the cast unsympathetic and even useless. 
-) closer to the expectations of the era it came out. Its art-style is way too retro to appeal to the modern audience. Its themes have also been analyzed much better in older shows and movies to appeal to an older audience. 
-) not feeling like a loose remake of the famous homonymous movie from ----. Those who have seen it will most likely hate how they turned a live action to an animated feature with blobby characters. 
So, why they made this movie then? I suspect just for the nostalgia factor. It is based on a manga by the late Osamu Tezuka (inspired by but not based on the homonymous movie classic), so it would feel nice to the people who grew up with his works. It is also a retro-styled movie which will appeal to all those who grew up with cartoons and anime from the --’s. So as you can tell, it aims at a very narrowed audience, since most of them would by now be either dead or not interested in cartoons for decades. As for the rest who would really sit down to watch it for old times sake, I am not sure they would appreciate how it combined the old style with modern computer generated images. 
Thus not even nostalgia will work. You get this obsolete-looking (in style) movie, showing a hundred events, each one not lasting more than a few minutes, and everything feeling like a dried up patchwork of sci-fi ideas you have already seen and analyzed much better elsewhere. How could it possibly work compared to Ghost in the Shell, or Blade Runner? How can these blobs of characters possibly make you feel anything? 
And skip all that; let’s just suppose we are to criticize the events of the movie based on context and not proper duration or presentation, and without comparing them to any earlier works of fiction. They still suck in reasoning. Here, let me tell you why. 
-) Workers take up arms to drive away the robots who steal their jobs. It’s as if the robots are to blame for everything when in reality it was man himself who created them to be so damn loyal and efficient. So instead of attacking the root of the problem (the people creating them or making money from them) they just randomly attack the symptoms (poor robots just doing what they were told). And even if that is supposed to be showing the folly of man, as he directs his frustration towards the wrong issues, it still makes no sense as these workers end up being eliminated by said robots. This renders all this aspect of the movie as completely useless, since not only they attacked the wrong people (or in this case, robots), they also didn’t manage to accomplish anything. 
-) A detective and his nephew come to the city to investigate a case. Trust me when I say they didn’t do much of an investigation, as the robot girl was found by complete accident and the man responsible simply revealed himself. Another useless part of the film. 
-) The big boss of the city wants to create a robot that will apathetically control all other machines of the world, and for that he asks to resemble a dead girl with feelings? This makes no sense. 
-) What would the bib boss’ son would gain by sabotaging the whole project? He would definitely not make his father to like him more. Thus not even he makes any sense. 
-) What is the detective boy’s role in the film? To look all cute and innocent next to the robot girl? He didn’t offer anything other than being dragged from one scene to another. 
-) Why would we consider the robot girl to be a tragic character? It is a robot that hardly does anything in the whole film. 
-) Why did everything go to hell in the end anyway? It is never explained. 
So no, it is not a good film. Not by miles. 
And now for some excused scorings.

I call this anime: watchable garbage. And by this I mean, even though its utter trash, its so much easier to sit through than its appallingly bad manga. I mean you're watching one of those typical text-book pornos, but minus the sex and non-con and other weird stuff. Yes, its bad, but at least not terrible. Maybe watch it when you just have nothing better to do.  
Story: -/-- 
What they basically did to Dakaretai Otoko was turn an obscene manga into something more TV appropriate (and I use this term very, very loosely). The premise is, well, cliche. A tsundere lead with a almost scarily pushy love interest, very typical BL (or any romance anime) formula. Tsundere hates their love interest, pushes them away, gets upset when they distance themselves, gets crazy jealous about things and so on. I'm not gonna lie though, I was lowkey into the whole acting plot. If this was an anime about a young man (who happens to be gay) and his endeavors towards becoming a great actor, this would be an extremely fun watch. The one thing I actually did appreciate, however, was how they got rid of the non-con scenes (even though this anime is still borderline dub-con, its honestly something).  
Art: -/-- 
It's just...mediocre, BL art. The proportions are sometimes conveniently ""yaoi-sized"", but besides that, nothing too terrible. The character design is nothing special either, but its alright. The animation is also slightly choppy, but I do see some potential in it as a whole. They somehow make it work, I guess.  
Sound: -/-- 
Both opening and ending songs are pretty good, soundtrack is decent. And I definitely can't complain about the voice-acting because its just subpar. Plus bonus points for Hiroki Takahashi's voice, its just so amazingly flexible!  
Character: -/-- 
Where do I even begin. Its honestly just a mess. I don't understand why they try so hard to force this ""angel"" persona on Junta when he's this weird, manipulative and possessive person. Takato, on the other hand, probably has more potential to be interesting, but its just overshadowed by his strange on and off tsundere behavior. I'm even more disappointed because it's not even good tsundere, like...at least do it right. The two characters individually probably aren't THAT bad but god, their chemistry is just...way off. The only thing I did enjoy was probably the age difference. That's it.  
Enjoyment: -/-- 
This rating is super strange because most of the elements are pretty underwhelming. But like I said earlier, this anime is watchable, entertaining garbage. Its just so strange and appalling that it just ends up being funny, and so, its a pretty enjoyable(???) watch in my opinion. Its really fun watching all the pointless conflicts unfold, and the way they try to censor out the s*x scenes is just hilarious (but maybe I'm just strange like that?) 
Overall: -/-- 
TLDR: You'll probably only like this anime unironically if you're someone underaged who just discovered yaoi on the internet or something. The cliche plot and characters makes this a bit frustrating to watch, especially with the fact that the characters refuse to remain consistent throughout the series. I honestly still wonder why they chose this specific to turn into an anime adaptation when its so...below average. Nevertheless, you don't really have to hate yourself to give this a watch.

Connect is a really good opening.  This is an uglier version of it. 
Mahou Shoujo Sonico★Magica is an April Fool’s joke where Sonico replaces Madoka during the opening of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica.  Except it’s animated in flash or something and sickens me.  All the other characters in the thingy show up for maybe a fraction of a second.   
On one hand, this thing weirds the hell out of me.  The animation is bizarre as hell and I find it uncomfortable.  But on the other hand, it’s an amusing spoof of an opening I love.  But everything is all jiggly and weird.  That’s not in reference to Sonico being fat.  Watch as an excuse to add another completed to your list and listen to the best thing ClariS has ever done.

Re:zero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu is a kind of show that tries to be as simple as it simply brings the protagonist Subaru into another world,while at the same time tries to pull out a story that filled with many twists.Its a brave try,yet it works successfully. 
Story:(--/--)(--%) 
Unique and original story setting.We have ""respawn"",we have different kinds of species of creatures in the another world,all of that are all well drawn and described. 
Some people may think the story is too simple but I felt in the opposite way,as the story filled with a lot of twists and climax.Once Subaru was arrived into the unknown world,he met a lot of events which causes him die a lot of times and all the events are all unpredictable,which makes me felt Incredibly excited and thrilled. 
Also, Subaru made changes after each of the 'time travel',which made the story continue to move on.Meanwhile,as the story goes on,it introduces different personalities of each character.I think this not only make depths on the characters but also keep the audience stay tuned,which make me felt in love with this anime,make the whole content feels rich. 
The story is well-connected with all of the other characters.All of the storyline is based on characters personalities and characteristics.For example,Subaru have desire on become more strong and willing to protect others.But on the other hand,he is over confident about himself,he feels like he is just an otaku in an fantasy world.The fact is Subaru actually has no idea or knowledge about how things actually works in the world,which cause him so many troubles through the story.He is also very unlucky due to many unforunate things bring to him and nearby characters. 
Character:(--/--)(--%) 
People may think Subaru is dumb and weak,which cause this anime a disaster.However,I think this is actually the highlight of the character development,as when weak people feel he is weak,that person will definitely make improvements.Also Subaru have positive attitude on  
protecting others and caring others.For example,when he first enters the world,he actually not  
afraid yet the first thing he do is to help others. 
For other characters,such as rem,ram and Emilia,they all show their point of view when Subaru is tried hard on protecting them.For example,Emilia is first ignores Subaru,then have good impressions on him but then afterwards she was annoyed by Subaru's movement on which Subaru doesn't respect on others.They even being introduced on their back stories on their childhood life,which explains why Rem felt Subaru untrustworthy at first but felt trustworthy with Subaru when Subaru make changes after his death. 
All of the above shows that the anime did a great job on describing each characters and able to make the characters individual. 
However,since they focus too much on Ram and Subaru,Emilia seems to be forgotten from the show.All I know is Subaru is lovesick with Emilia but only because she is adorable and he wants to protect her but that's it,there's somehow no further explanation on that and the interactions between them is shallow,which the anime could be improved. 
Though overall it's still really nice,so --/-- 
Sound(includes music):(--/--)(--%) 
Sadly,due to the length of the story,the opening or ending music is always being cut off,feel some kind of enjoyment being ripped off,singing in op sounds is a bit unappealing,but it done well on the sound effects,background music and voice acting during the fighting scenes,really could add emotional feelings to the audience.Even during conversions,there's some soundtrack playing on the back,which can fits the story efficiently. 
Art:(--/--)(--%) 
Outstanding,definitely meet my expectations.:D 
The whole animation art looks realistic and the fighting scenes are absolutely exciting,feels like I'm in that world. 
Even in the fighting scenes,there are many magic skills,movements and combat with strategy ,which I feels it is extremely rich and exciting. 
Enjoyment:(--/--)(--%) 
Full of unpredictable climax,plot twists,realistic animation art and nice sound effects and voice acting must kept you remain on seats. 
The only problem is that episode - is way too long,although episode - is able to introduce the whole story background and some of the events occurred in that episode might affect Subaru's decision,the anime should shorten the length of episode in order to make it simple. 
But since the good sides overcome the bad sides,it achieves a --/-- for me.

The concept of time in the universe of Gintama is by far its most fascinating meta subject. For as much as the show likes to mock itself for its seemingly unchanging sitcom status quo, the fact is that Edo has never been frozen in time. The world has evolved with the show, with new characters, new relationships, old relationships developing and deepening, new playing fields of possibility being opened, and an increasingly changing understanding of the foundation fabric of the story itself., whether in massive game-changing arcs or the nuances of the ever-evolving sitcom antics themselves. Like its central character, Gintama is a show that is constantly looking forward, constantly running towards the future that waits just beyond its grasp. It’s what’s made it such an exhilarating watch for me, the excitement of wanting to find out just how far this world and my relationship with it would grow and evolve over time. It’s an incredible strength in a show full of incredible strengths. 
I bring this up because this is the only time in Gintama’s history where it has, quite literally, decided to stop looking forward and turn back the clock. The Slip Arc is composed of lighter segments and arcs from the manga that were never adapted before, the one-off stories the anime skipped over on its journey to its explosive climax with the Shogun Assassination and Farewell Shinsengumi arcs. Which means that not only are we taking a breather before rushing into what still appears to be the true goddamn finale, we’re taking a breather in the past, in that stretch of easy-going time before Shigeshige's death firmly closed the book on Gintama ever going back to the show it was before. Characters who had died are still around, characters who went through development haven’t had that development yet, and the stakes-raising intensity that followed the Pinky Promise arc is completely absent. This is nostalgic Gintama, complete with the closest thing to a “standard format” OP we’ve gotten since Day by Day, It’s a trip down memory lane, remembering the fun times we used to share before finally taking on the final boss in the next chamber. 
And you know what? I’m completely okay with that. 
Yes, it is, for lack of a more descriptive term, weird to see Umibozu running around still being an over-protective, smothering father after turning over a new leaf following the Battle at Rakuyo. It’s weird to see the Shinsengumi still hanging around, and Sasaki still alive. It’s weird to suddenly be returning focus to the street level we abandoned so long ago, to hang out with characters like Ikamatsu the ramen lady and Hasegawa, the former of whom we haven’t even seen since Katsura first busted up her shop almost --- episodes ago. But you know what? I liked Hasegawa. I liked Ikamatsu. I liked when I could just stretch my arms and relax with this show, when not every arc needed to be the biggest, most world-ending thing ever. We have had -- straight episodes of the most awe-inspiring action of the show’s history, the biggest upheavals and reversals and explosions ever. It’s been a LOT. It’s been a lot of good, but it’s been a lot. So if the impetus here is to relax and take a load off, to remember why we fell in love with this show in the first place before bidding it farewell, then I see no reason not to enjoy it for all it's worth. 
And I say this as someone who has absolutely fucking loved this new era of GIntama; seeing the story enter its final stretch has been so rewarding on so many levels, a masterpiece of payoff that has left me reeling from the impact over and over again. But while Gintama may shine in these big moments, its heart still lies in the small. Yoshiwara in Flames, Battle at Rakuyo, Farewell Shinsengumi, none of these arcs would be as meaningful without the weight of the countess hours we’ve spent just living with these idiots, experiencing life with them in all its stupidity and brilliance. The slowly expansive sitcom formula that defined this show for so long is the soul of Gintama, and it only makes sense to return to it one last time before the grand finale. Whether or not this was planned is an entirely different question all together, but if there’s one thing watching anime for so long has taught me, it’s that something doesn’t need to be planned to matter. 
So yes, I quite enjoyed the Slip Arc and everything it represented. This is Gintama, back in its original form for one last hurrah, full of fun memories and stupid larks and more poop jokes than I know what to do with. This is why I fell in love with you in the first place, show, this wild, uninhibited stream of consciousness, full of humor and heart in equal measure. And I see no reason to complain about that.

Iron-Blooded Orphans (IBO) is the most recent installment in the Mobile Suit Gundam Universe, but avoids the tired and stale aspects of the more recent predecessors. IBO paints the disturbing reality that child soldiers face in a war torn era - it is a provocative yet grief-stricken series that highlights everything wrong with placing a gun in a child's hands. While the story itself is a highlight of the series, IBO's most glaring problem is in character development where it is hard to support the convictions on many of the characters due to incomplete background knowledge of their circumstances. 
{Story} - IBO's story is most certainly its strongest point. There is never a dull episode and the pacing is consistent and engaging throughout the -- episode series. The heart-wrenching stories of child soldiers fighting for what they believe is the only way they can live will keep you rooting for characters beyond the main characters and the overarching story is fulfilling. 
{Art} - As with nearly all Gundam series, the art is very good. With that said, there is nothing in IBO that makes it stand-out from the rest of the Gundam universe. 
{Sound} - Similarly to IBO's art, the sound in IBO is very good and on par with most Gundam series. The opening and ending songs are all very catchy and will likely find their way onto your anime playlist (if you're into that sort of thing). 
{Character} - Character development in IBO is where I found the series to fall flat. I really never understood or believed the rationality behind some of the main characters motivations - particularly Mikazuki. While there is an announced season - on its way where their background may be expanded upon - until then I found their lack of backstory to be a glaring issue as I never felt connected to anyone except for Orga. 
{Enjoyment} - As I mentioned earlier, the series never had a dull moment. Even the slower paced episodes had interesting and important elements that kept the story flowing and keeping the viewers interest. As long as you're into the mecha genre, you'll be entertained the whole way. 
{Overall} - Overall I gave IBO an -/--. The overarching story and subject matter was excellent and would have earned a solid -/-- if not for a severe lack of character development and background information. Hopefully this will be remedied in the upcoming season - in the Fall of ----! The series is definitely worth watching and my favorite Gundam series since Seed.

-Spoiler free review- 
I wouldn't usually feel the need to write a review, but the helpful reviews (at the time of writing this) are around the -/- mark. This OVA is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. I will start off by saying I've never read the manga, and the fully adapted anime is to be released shortly. Even with no prior reading I believe this show stands by itself fantastically, portraying a beautiful story with an almost Ghibli vibe. 
Story(-/--) 
What a beautiful story is was, endearing from start to finish. The premise of the story was very easy to grasp, and there was no need for any prior knowledge to understand what was happening in the mc's (Chise's) life. The pacing is slow, but perfectly suited for the OVAs content. This pacing allows the viewer to fully absorb the beautiful world created infront of you, and it gives the viewer time to become emotionally invested in the characters. This emotional attatchment stems from the themes covered by the OVA, with themes such as loneliness, family and loss being hugely relatable to me on a personal level and Im sure many of you can relate to these themes. The story does touch on some overused classic ""sob stories"" to set up Chise's past, however, the portrayal of the influence these events on Chise have are beyond any anime Ive ever seen and the execution of these scenes are done perfectly. 
Art(--/--) 
It can easily be seen just how much time has been invested into making this one of the most visually stunning OVAs/animes I have ever seen. From the very first scene the art sets the standards high, and only improves from then on. This can especially be seen in particular highlight moments in episodes -/-, where the art style compliments the story beautifully, bringing the whole OVA together as one. 
Sound(-/--) 
Personally, I found the sound track to compliment the OVA almost perfectly. I noticed almost every piece of music when it started, and I would say it managed to bring many scenes together beautifully. The soundtrack itself is not there to act as the centre of attention, it is there to reinforce the beautiful story and art and give a nice emotional touch (that might even tear you up) in many pivotal scenes.  
Character(-/--) 
The characters are fantastically made, with a deep intruiging backstory for Chise. The librarian's character is also incredibly well done, with his mentality and struggles being portrayed perfectly. There are, however, some virtually untouched characters due to the short length of the OVA. The only one of these I found to be an issue was the dog, with the skull-guy and the pink-girly being incredibly well introduced considering how little they feature. The dog, however, was not well done- so perhaps the anime (or manga) needs to be watched/read to do this character justice. 
Overall (--/--) 
This anime is a masterpiece, it will play with your emotions at many points throughout, and will leave you wanting more from this beautiful world. And good news! More is coming! I can only hope that the anime will do the OVA justice- especially in the art department- as it has set the bar high. If you were looking for a Ghibli-esque fantasy world and an emotional journey, youve found the right OVA!

(This review takes into account the final - episodes as well.) 
To start off, I am a sucker for shows that deal with swapping bodies.  This series was no exception.  Without giving away anything too much, I also liked how they changed to different phenomenon other than body swapping.  
The characters I really liked as well.  While some of them seem to exude a lot of the cookie-cutter anime tropes that get old quick, they managed to pull the audience in with more depth to their dilemmas (especially in the case of Irori.)  The usage of numerous phenomena to reveal backstory and character traits, I thought was a very clever way of introducing the audience to the characters.   
My favorite aspect of this show was Inaba.  Even if there were times when I thought the series used tired tropes from slice-of-life anime, I could always expect that they'd use this character to pretty much speak my thoughts and be the voice of reason when the other characters were being too irrational and stereotypical of this genre of anime.  When I first started watching this series, I was just thinking the whole time ""oh my goodness, Inaba is basically who I'd be if I was a cute anime girl."" 
I thought the main villain was also handled very well.  He appears at random moments inhabiting peoples bodies whenever he feels like it, and it always comes across as being super creepy and weird because you don't know what he is or why he's causing so much havoc with these characters. 
If there's anything I think they could've changed, I think maybe they could've set up the characters in a less rushed fashion at the beginning and then had them swap bodies.  From my experience watching American cartoons all my life, I can easily say the body swapping trope only works great if you've already firmly established the characters regardless of what kind of show you're watching. 
Overall, I'd say this show was very good.  Not perfect by any means, but still very enjoyable if you like slice-of-life anime with a bit of a creative spin to it. 
(Also, the music in this was top notch.  Probably the first anime I've seen where the music really stuck out to me.)

The main character of the story is Kuronuma Sawako, you follow her through her high school days. She is in no way normal, from the beginning its quite humorous and you do feel pity for her because of her morbid appearance she gives off and most people think something horrid will happen if you make eye contact for a certain amount of time. 
Kuronuma is in love with Kazehaya a boy who has helped her overcome her boundaries of being an outcast, he also happens to be the most popular kid in the school.  
But the purpose of the anime in my opinion is somewhat a becoming of age story, with help from new found friends this girl will go through struggles of being in love, making and trying to make friends happy, being taken advantage of, and most importantly growing out of her shell to be more outgoing and lovable as a character. 
With the help of her friends the sweet pure hearted Kuronuma Sawako should bring us on a journey we will enjoy.

Kingdom could really be described as one of those Anime’s that nearly reached perfection but lacked an element or two un-allowing it to do so. I absolutely loved everything about Kingdom; however you do have to make it past the first -- episodes or so to get to the real action. Note: I don’t know anything about China’s history so I won’t be talking about the history element of this Anime in the review. 
Criteria  
Story: -.- 
The story of Kingdom Season - continues off from season in the sense that both Xin’s and Zheng’s dreams are the same, except this time Xin’s dreams stray somewhat onto the path of Zheng’s. Zheng’s dream as we all know form those who watched season - wants to unite all of China something that has never been done before, and Xin’s dreams is to become The Greatest General Under the Heavens. However in season - there is a lot more politics of war with both ‘wars’ going on inside the castle and on the battlefield. Be prepared for a lot of drama in this season as well because --% of the time I was on the edge of my seat. 
Ending: - 
The ending for season - however although good didn’t quite do it for me, as events don’t wrap up as soon as the great war is over, they seem to just drag on for another --- episodes all which could have been wrapped up in - max -. Although the ending was somewhat happy and suspenseful and it also leaves me hoping for a season -.  
Solid Plot: -.- 
The plot for season - was somewhat easier to maintain than season - due to the fact that season - only contained - war and politics whereas season - contained a near - wars with politics. Therefor the plot was fluid easily understandable and rarely strayed off path.  
Moral: -- 
Basically elaborates the already set moral of season - further by simply stating how we don’t bring up the sacrifices our comrades made we simply honor them and remember them and we do not cry over them. Also goes further to state that no matter the position of a person on the battlefield the all carry the same weight on the shoulders and it is this weight that makes them strong.  
“[We carry the dreams and feeling of our fallen nakama on our shoulders which makes us strong]” A simple yet also touching moral to this story filled with sacrifice and death. Our nakama did not die for any reason, they sacrificed themselves so that we may carry out their wishes, their dreams, their feeling, just because they are dead does not mean we should forget these things, these things that they stood for, because when we truly forget these things is when they truly are dead.  
Sense: - 
Even though in season - it didn’t really bother me, the lack of blood in the anime when someone is cut really did start to annoy me in season -, due to the simple fact that people would just die after being cut yet have no wounds or signs of a cut. However overall when it comes down to politics, war tactics and everything else in general, it does make sense. 
Music: - 
The BGM in season -, to me, was a lot more noticeable than that of season -; I found that the was a lot more emphasis on the BGM and it played at perfect times, die to this sad scenes would seem sadder and exciting scenes would get the audience more excited. 
Art: - 
The same general art style of that from season - except some obvious changes to character design due to their being a time skip. That same sense of realism with the art is also kept so we don’t have to adapt our eyes to a new art style. The only thing that really annoyed where some characters eyes, not how they were drawn more how they acted; for example there are some characters who have their eyes closed --% of time and some who have them open --% of the time, by this I mean the rarely ever open or close their eyes…in essence there wasn’t enough blinking… 
Characters: - 
The same characters you know and love from season - are obviously in season - except stronger, taller and ready for all the new challenges. The one major thing I like about Kingdoms characters in terms of character developments and progression is that both of those factors increase with the characters title and with other characters respect to the said character; for example in season - Xing’s character development and progression are noticed by his rank going from a simple servant to a ----man general which is incredibly impressive. Other developments include the strong relationships he build and how much these characters respect and value Xin, which is demonstrated through how they are always there to pick him up after a big fight, or even put themselves in the line of fire for him to survive, this shows the audience how much faith, trust and respect all these characters have for Xin…Xin who was once a mere servant. 
Boredom/Captivation Scale: -.- 
With the added drama element to season - I found myself enjoying season - a lot more than I had season - and found more self quite literally at times on the edge of my seat. “Is he gonna die?” “Is she gonna die?” Is hi gonna kill him?” “Is he gonna let him live?” All these questions and a lot more you find yourself asking yourself whilst watching season - of Kingdom. 
Personal Score: -.- 
I really would have liked to give this season a perfect -- and I probably would have it had as much gore as it did in the manga, and I’m talking about peoples head getting chopped off, peoples guts flying out their stomachs and head literally getting crushed to oblivion; after all this was rated as an R--+ anime yet it didn’t have as much R--+ as I’d hoped it would have (In the manga they literally take R--+ to the next level)  
Genres 
Action: - 
Enough action packed fighting scenes in Kingdom to be shared among --- different Anime shows, so yer I’d say kingdom is pretty action packed. However one down side is that some fight scenes are repetitive with the cannon fodder battling cannon fodder but the strategic point of those scenes makes up for it.  
Drama/Suspense: - 
When there not fighting, or plotting to take the throne, or unite China then it’s filled with drama and enough drama to pull at your hair. Also the suspenseful scenes that entwine with the drama support the series nicely  
Military: --   
Everything from politics of war to the combat of war is done very well in Kingdom, so well infarct that I think I’ve learned a thing or two about war and how it’s actually done both on the lines and behind the lines 
P.S sorry for any grammatical errors…this was not proof read….

Overview: 
Are you tired of action shonen series with a fighting tournament every - story arcs? Want to see something different? Anime has many different genres from which to choose: psychological drama, slice of life, echii comedy, sports, etc. How about something REALLY different? An anime centered around trading that mainly teaches the viewer principals of economics like inflation, buying on margin, and short selling stock? Spice and Wolf is a show so uniquely odd that I had a hard time convincing my friends that it actually exists. This is an anime so dialogue heavy and business oriented that it would likely get better ratings on Bloomberg than on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Spice and Wolf also has some well written romance and great characters, so even if you aren't into economics, there is still a chance you will like it. 
Story --/-- 
The story of Spice and Wolf seems simple, but it is very well written and can actually teach the viewer something. It would be an understatement to say that Spice and Wolf is much better at teaching economics principals than Hetalia is at teaching history. For an anime to have such a daringly unique and unconventional story in today's consumer driven media is extraordinary. The setting in medieval Europe reminds me of the famous economic author Ludwig Von Mises and his tendency to use Robinson Crusoe to simplify and better explain complex fiscal theories. 
The story begins when a travelling merchant discovers an unusual girl with dog ears and a tail lying naked in the pile of wheat he is transporting. Lawrence is obviously shocked by this, but the mysterious girl Holo claims to be a Goddess that controls the harvest and now wishes to leave this village because the farmers no longer believe in her. Lawrence is skeptical, but Holo offers to prove that she is a wolf goddess by transforming in front of him and causing him to faint from sheer terror. Later that night, Holo appears before Lawrence again and convinces him to take her along with him since she needs to travel with wheat as a harvest deity. This is sort of like Dracula and his need to travel with his coffin and soil of Romania. Holo offers her wise advice she has gained from centuries of living to help Lawrence in the world of trading, and Lawrence in turn will eventually take her back to her birthplace in the far north country of Yoitsu. 
Characters: --/-- 
The two main characters are Kraft Lawrence and the wolf goddess, Holo. Kraft Lawrence is a very believable and realistic protagonist. He is a medieval merchant that at first mostly cares about profit and seems to have a Randian Objectivist outlook. However, as the series goes on we see that he does have a heart and he grows as a character. Lawrence doesn't conform to the stereotypes of anime romance leads. He isn't a pushover that lets a harem of girls beat him up all the time. He isn't a secret pervert that gets nosebleeds at the slightest provocation. He isn't a musclebound hero that rescues random damsels in distress. What he is, is a well rounded character that seems like a real person. Since this is tagged as a Romance title, it is not a spoiler that Lawrence eventually begins to develop some feelings for Holo. However, he is reserved with his feelings and doesn't rush head first into a relationship. Lawrence is calm and calculating as one would expect from a medieval broker. The other character is Holo, who calls herself the ""Wise Wolf"". Holo is centuries old deity that can help crops grow and bring bountiful harvests. However, as mentioned above, she has been abandoned for a new God, which is sort of the Spice and Wolf universe's version of Christianity. This new monotheism denounces the old Gods despite the viewer knowing for a fact that they exist and believes only in - God, which the viewer never sees any evidence exists. However, Holo doesn't take revenge because she is not a ""jealous God"" as God Himself said in the Old Testament. Holo is a very bored god that lives in the field of wheat and longs to return to the place she was born. How Gods are born in this series has yet to be explained as of the end of season -, but it isn't particularly important. The important thing is that she wishes to return to the land of Yoitsu in the far north. Yoitsu is a very vast land with lots of snow, lots of wolves, and few people. If Holo is an accurate representative of the population, the people of Yoitsu seem to have hair trigger tempers and a propensity to get sauced. I honestly wonder why the English dub didn't just give her a Russian accent and be done with it. Holo is in fact quite wise and knows the ways of the world through her centuries of life. However, she can often act immaturely and has a very sharp tongue. It is shown quite often that Holo is very cautious about developing feelings for a mortal, because she knows that she will be alive for centuries after her love has died. Like Lawrence, Holo is a well rounded and believable character that doesn't just fit into an established mold like ""tsundere"" or ""yandere"". A point of criticism from some viewers revolves around Holo's lack of shyness in regards to nudity. The nudity in Spice and Wolf though is very mild and avoids showing nipples or any detailed bits feminine anatomy. It is far more artistic than erotic and realistically displays the attitude that a God would have around mere humans. 
Sound Track: -/-- 
From the absolutely beautiful opening theme to the sickeningly sweet ending theme, Spice and Wolf has a solid OST. The soundtrack is heavy on flute pieces and seems to fit the environment of an alternate Medieval Europe. My only criticism is that some tracks sound a little too silly like the track ""Kenshi to Yopparai"" which bares a striking resemblance to the famous Torgo theme from ""Manos"". 
Art:  -/-- 
The character drawings are fine, but art isn't really the strong point of this series. The animation is normally OK, but there are scenes that are so poorly animated that it causes unintentional hilarity. Just type: ""Spice and Wolf horse"" into youtube and see what I mean. Those scenes with horrendous animation are few and far between, but they are in fact there and stick out like a sore thumb. 
Enjoyment -/-- 
I will say that this is a very dialogue heavy anime. There is little action and that alone may throw off many viewers. Parts of the series can get confusing, so if you can't quite wrap your head around an economic concept or a certain sub-plot, don't be afraid to rewind and watch again. This is especially true if you are watching the subbed version and aren't a very fast reader. Spice and Wolf is not an anime for everyone like Cowboy Bebop or Attack on Titan. It doesn't go for a calculated line drive when it can go all out and swing for the fences. As a result, Spice and Wolf will either be a strikeout or an out of the park home run depending on the viewer. 
Overall --/-- 
Spice and Wolf is the kind of anime that only comes around once in a long while. It is a daring and unique series that everyone should at least try. If you watch the first - episodes and absolutely hate it (like most of my friends), that is OK. You don't need to torture yourself and finish the whole thing. However, if you have the desire to keep watching, it is a series that won't disappoint.

After watching this for a third time in the last eight years, I can still say that this is my favorite anime. The themes are very real to me and if you let yourself be immersed by the characters, culture, and plot, you will walk away with a heavy heart and a full mind.  
Like most ABe anime, this is not for everyone.  
If you are looking for constant action or laughs, I would chose something else.  
The first five episodes are quite slow, but it lets you take in the details. It helps you focus on the characters and realize they were all part of different walks in their previous life. It more importantly sets up the culture and setting, helping you to form your own theories about who the haibane are meant to be.  
The sixth episode is where the darker underlying theme start. This series tackles ideas of loss, attachment, depression and suicide. I admit for anyone who has not felt the sense of pure helplessness or bundling emotions until they burst can not fully understand the weight of the internal conflicts both Rakka and Reki face.  
I personally view this series with a spiritual mind rather than a religious one. Though haibane resemble angels, they are born again due to some past sin that they committed or couldn't overcome. Their wings are useless, they do not have a connection to a higher being, and they are almost seen as mystical creatures by the residing humans, often described as a cheerful presence that can give good luck. The haibane are instructed not to use anything that wasn't first used by a human, leading me to believe it is a hint for both discrimination and to cut off ties of the material nature of man. Their whole existence is to make peace within themselves so they can escape the walls on their Day of Flight.  
This anime teaches you that salvation can not come from yourself. You need to trust others and express your emotions or you will find yourself in the endless, vicious, self-loathing cycle. 
""To recognize one's sin is to have no sin. So are you a sinner?"" 
""But if I believe have no sin I become a sinner."" 
""This is the cycle of sin. Think about it. To spin in the same circle, looking for where the sin lies, and at some point losing sight of the way out. To find the answer is to find redemption."" 
If you are someone who has trouble breaking the sinner's paradox, you will forever be sin bound. You need to realize your sin and know that you will sin again, but to learn from your mistakes and help others forgive you. In turn, they will aide you to break the cycle.  
Both Rakka and Reki exemplify consuming sin, which is shown by their wings turning a spotty black. Rakka had help from a crow (who was someone she knew in her previous life), which showed that although someone cared for her, after she presumably committed suicide, they still forgave her and wanted to send a message that she was not alone. After overcoming the feelings of wanting to disappear, Rakka uses her strength to help Reki, who was even more hopeless in finding salvation.  
The ending is bittersweet, but truly outstanding. This series is haunting yet charming, unique and touching. The musical score is enchanting and although the art may not always be the best, it makes up for it in every other aspect. For someone who constantly struggles with depression, it gives you hope and a reason to trust others, even when you don't believe in yourself.

this got really bad. 
the torturted animista can only suspect who actually were the culprits pressed the studio in this way to deliver a sequel, but do in no way anything like the first run. whoever it seems it was someone pritty fat and humourless but with a lot of influence to actually insist in the second season, for contract reasons only of course (!), but could force the makers to iron the whole thing flat. as flat they just could get it. really flat i mean.  
they removed all elements which created not a spectacular but still entertaining anime in season one, as the sense of humour, the artwork and flawless animation suited the topic, and replace them with more of the dreadful ""ganbanakya, ganbanakya"" singing of morally indisputable, rather square looking crybabies. Was surprised they actually could swim. 
holy bukatsu! Now this will propably give president putin some well deserved tears of moral enjoyment.  
maa ii, - points because it had some colour and sound! thats quite generous.

Keita Suminoe is a fifteen year old middle school student who only wants one thing...  To pass his finals, and make it into the same high school as his older twin sisters, Ako and Riko.  But he has two obstacles standing in his way.  The first is that he’s far more athletic than scholarly, which makes studying and taking tests difficult for him to manage.  And the second is that both of his sisters are madly in love with him, providing him with endless distractions as he tries to do the simplest things like eat, sleep, and of course, study.  And it’s not just them, either...  One of his teachers, a fellow student that he accidentally groped, and a short loli-like girl from his school are all starving for a taste of his knob.  What can poor Keita do when these women have so much love to give to him, and he only has about six inches to give to them? 
KissXSis was allegedly animated by a small time company called Feel.  Why do I say allegedly?  Because it looks nowhere near as good as one of their other anime, So I Can’t Play H, whose incredible production values was it’s only redeeming factor.  In fact, the difference in quality between these shows that were made only two years apart is so vast that I almost want to call BS on wikipedia for telling it to me.  I guess it’s possible that feel didn’t feel the need to put as much money into this project as they’d later wind up pouring into H, and if that’s the case, I suppose I understand. 
That’s not to say the animation is awful, though.  It’s not great, but I’ve seen plenty of shows that looked a lot worse than this.  The artwork is crisp and clean, and a few of the character designs are inspired, although most of them look generic, and the weird little shiny marks on the girls’ skin can get pretty distracting.  The bare bones budget is actually managed fairly well.   There are several moments when the moneysaving animation techniques are blatantly obvious, but for the most part, the series sticks to slow, limited movements that suit it best, saving it’s money for the few...  Um...  *cough* action scenes that need it more.  What bothered me was more WHAT they were animating than how they were animating it, I guess.  The music isn't bad either, just generic and forgettable. 
So, I’m going to go into new territory here.  Over my years of reviews, I’ve made a habit out of talking about the animation of any given series as well as the company that produced them, but never before have I talked about the TV station that they aired on.  Since this show doesn’t have an English dub for me to discuss, and I don’t really feel up to discussing the sub, I’m going to go ahead and tell you all about a Japanese TV station called AT-X, or Anime Theater X.   
AT-X is a Japanese premium channel...  In other words, a pay-per-view station... that, by the very nature of those words, is allowed to show most of their programs uncensored, kind of like HBO.  They’ve aired many TV-MA titles since they were established in ----, including Elfen Lied, Mahoromatic, Highschool of the Dead, Dance in the Vampire Bund, and the Japanese dub of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic(Wrap your head around that one).  Being a pay-per-view station, they have the right to show their programming with nudity, excessive violence, groping, and all that fun adults-only stuff to it’s mainly adult crowd should they choose to do so, with streaming sites like Funimation.com and Crunchyroll.com opting to air censored versions anyway. 
This turned out to be the perfect place for KissXSis to air, as it’s filled to the brim with adult imagery.  Not only is there underwear shots and bare bottoms galore, this show goes all out with french kissing, lines of drool falling afterwards as a result of said kissing, frequent groping, girls peeing(from many different angles), the outline of the main character’s erect penis through his clothes as his sisters very explicitly fondle it...  And yet, in the very rare moments of actual nudity, the girls in the series were given nondescript Barbie doll bodies.  Considering just how little of a fuck this series gives in regards to it’s content, that’s a hilariously bizarre omission to make.  Because, yeah, as far as this show is willing to go, nipples are the line they don’t want to cross.  It’s especially strange when you take into account that their brother, Keita, very clearly has nipples in the scene when Ako and Riko are teaming up to lick them.  I guess it makes sense that since he’s not blood related to them, he wouldn’t share the same physical deformity that they have.  At least that’s the explanation that I’m sticking with. 
My first attempt to watch this show was back in the fall of ----.  I’d heard some stuff about it from both sides of the fence, so I felt some morbid curiosity as to just how bad it could really be.  I wound up quitting after two episodes, already calling it the worst anime I’d ever seen.  To be clear, it’s not the incest that turned me off...  I’m not as offended by that topic as a lot of people are.  But in order to make the topic of incest appeal to a broader audience than just the people who want to jerk off to it, you HAVE to play the societal stigma card to make the material relatable.  The related couple has to face judgement from the people around them.  I mentioned as much in my review of Oreimo, and I even used what little I’d seen of KissXSis as a reference tool.   
What had me running away from KissXSis as fast as I possibly could was, ultimately, the way it’s world was reacting to our three blood crossed lovers.  At school, the entire male student body was obsessed with Ako and Riko, to the point that they would ostracize and bully Keita for living with them, and form an unruly mob to chase the two girls whenever they wandered onto the school’s campus.  The only character who showed any repulsion to the idea was some big boobed glasses girl who you could immediately tell was just going to fall in love with Keita, effectively turning what could have been moral outrage into jealousy.  As I would later learn from the appearance of his teacher, that’s exactly what the writers were going for.  Keep in mind, at no point in the story are we given any insight into why such bland looking characters would be sexually deified to such extreme levels. 
And to make matters worse, their parents weren’t just okay with this debauchery between their children...  They were encouraging it.  Right at the end of episode -, they start hounding Keita to excavate the gold mine of forbidden pussy that lived a few rooms down from him.  They also drop the bomb on us that Keita and his sisters aren’t really related by blood...  Keita is his son, and the twins are the mom’s daughters, so they’re actually just step siblings, and the anime constantly shoves the fact that they’re blood relatives down our throats to remind us that what’s going on between them is perfectly A-ok.  Which, as I’ve mentioned in the past, it’s not.  Children who grow up from a young age together as siblings and go through puberty in closed together become sexually desensitized to each other, and I swear i’m not making that up.  Whether or not they’re actually related by blood is a non-issue, that’s just how it works.  It’s legally okay, but only the sleaziest perverts ever call upon legal loopholes to excuse their tastes. 
After confirming with the second episode that this show was not going to get any better, I decided I’d had enough, and stayed away from it for a year and a half.  That was until my long awaited two week vacation from work, when I let my two best friends each pick an anime for me to watch in my free time, and one of them challenged me to finish the series once and for all.  The only reason I’m not going to punch him in the face is because he said I don’t have to watch the OVAs. 
Upon my second attempt to watch KissXSis, I’ve noticed that not only does the series never get any better, but it takes every possible opportunity to get worse.  And I’m not just talking about the depraved sexual content, which any viewer will either be able to take or leave.  There is nothing in this series that’s even remotely suggestive of any kind of story-telling.  The only plot is whether or not Keita will wind up sleeping with one of his sisters, but he’s so willing to fool around with them at the slightest provocation that it winds up not really mattering whether they cross the line or not.  The only conflict is over which sister he winds up with, but he never really shows any preference, and will happily switch between them as though they were Coke and Pepsi.   
There’s no story either, as the entire series is just an endless string of moments between Keita and his sisters, with no stakes, no surprises, no revelations, just interaction after interaction, competition after competition.  It can’t get old, though, because unless you were on the edge of your seat waiting for something graphic to happen, it was never interesting in the first place.  It’s portrayal of women is insanely ignorant and misogynistic, but...  Well...  It’s hard to be mad at it about that, because at no point does it ever seem to concern itself with what women are really like.  Granted, I ranted and raved about that when I originally rage-quit the series, but upon a fresh look, and a surprisingly boring viewing experience that was occasionally interrupted by random bouts of “You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” I think I’ve finally nailed what this anime is, and why it feels like a nonentity to me at this point, as well as why I can’t bring myself to be angry over how brain-smashingly reprehensible the content is. 
KissXSis is, at it’s core, a sexless hentai.  Now, I’ve seen several anime that I could throw that same label at before, but this is the first one I’ve ever seen that was actually aired on TV.  There is nothing more pointless than a safe-for-TV porno.  You can not realistically expect a porno to have realistic female characters, because it’s a porno.  It’s a jerk-off fantasy.  The only real reason someone could possibly watch this all the way through is to jerk off to it(watching it for reviewing purposes is not a real reason...  I’m insane, and a horrible person, so don’t do what I did).  Everything that happens in this show is just build-up to sex scenes that never happen, leaving it only palatable for the most desperate viewers who are looking for a good incest romp and somehow don’t realize that there are actual hentai out there.   
The only other type of audience I can imagine this series having would be people who either A: Have siblings they wish they could screw or B:  Wish they had siblings they could screw, and in either case, they’re droolingly eager to find some sort of escapist self-insert jerk-off fantasy where they have a pair of willing and able sisters that aren’t technically related to them, in a world where only the jealous haters have anything negative to say about it.  That would be the life, wouldn’t it?  Only no, it wouldn’t.  Grow up, and stop kidding yourselves. 
KissXSis has never been released stateside, and no self-respecting legal streaming service would ever touch it with a sixty foot pole.  It’s available on illegal streaming sites, and while I’d normally never recommend such a tactic, I honestly don’t care one way or another whether or not this title makes any money.  You can also find the Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay for dirt cheap, as it’s only about thirteen dollars for the TV version of the series, and around the same cost for the OVA series of equal length that came out a few years prior. 
If KissXSis had been released as an actual legitimate hentai title, with at least the majority of it’s story arcs ending in sexual pay-offs, it would easily be one of the best titles in it’s genre, and no, I’m not exaggerating that.  The characters are well developed and complex...  By hentai standards.  The story is intelligent and well thought out...  By hentai standards.  The animation and music are very well produced...  By hentai standards.  With actual pay-offs instead of blue-ball teasing, the pacing would have been outstanding...  By hentai standards.  But this series wasn’t released straight to DVD in the adults only section of your local DVD store.  It was released on TV, in a much harsher and stricter medium.  As a legitimate TV anime, this show is just flat out pathetic, tasteless trash that only the most desperate and depraved audiences will find any sort of satisfaction with.  Since I am not one of them, I can’t even give this show a zero without feeling like I’m being too lenient with it.  Thus, I give KissXSis a --/--.  Or I would, if MAL would let me.

I'm not sure how helpful this review will be, I'll just say that upfront.  
Toradora! is funny, emotional and kind-hearted all at the same time. I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys the genre and anyone who doesn't. The characters are relatable, likable, complex and dynamic. This show thrives on the characters but the story keeps it all together. 
The story is something that can often ruin an anime but Toradora! keeps everything aligned and interesting for all -- episodes. There is enough spontaneity to keep you guessing and enough predictable to not through you off or create plot holes   
All in all, Toradora! gives you the certain vibe and feeling that is almost indescribable. You get so wrapped up in the story and the characters you feel a better empty after it is over. Fortunately, it's re-watch value is EXTREMELY high.

Ok, i really dont know how people rate this more than -. There are lots of meaningless scenes, %-- of this show is waste of time in my standards. So why does it sucks for me? 
Story: - (Poor) 
Calling this meaningful is the same as calling a coke can meaningful. All characters are paranoid, main character is schizophrenic. The story progresses like this, child goes to school for - minutes, on school teacher writes things to empty board without any ost but ASMR blackboard sounds. Then character gets some kind of dizzy state than somebody says - out of topic word, than she says another meaningless one... you got it. 
Art: - (Good) 
Drawings are good, yet dull. Because they are alone, nothing is strong enough to support art in this anime. So we can say only strong and dominant thing about this anime is art. 
Sound: - (Good) 
Ok, opening song is one of the best opening songs in the world, and sound recordings of this anime is ASMR quality. That being said, there are not interesting BGM's and most of the anime passes in silence. So if there isnt a good opening or good qualitied recording i would be giving it -. 
Character: - (Pathetic) 
Yes throw some paranoid characters. Show characters eyes for literally - minutes per episode, so people can see how well made these characters are. Truly pathetic. 
Enjoyment: - (Pathetic) 
Lets say you are waiting a bus for -- minutes, waiting bus to go to destined location for -- minutes, and walking from there to somewhere for -- minutes in a daily basis. And lets say you dont have that much distraction (like you dont have music player, smart phone and stuff). Would you be able to enjoy this thing? If yes then you can give it a -- because -- minute of an episode is filled with these kind of stuff. 
Overall: - (Poor) 
I really was positive about this anime, and reviewed in a positive way. 
So - is it? Yes, its the best i can give to this anime, really.

This review is a combination of the -st and -nd season. If i can sum up this entire series in one sentence it would be: ""It took them long enough."" 
Story = - - Nothing new, loser girl and popular guy with a lot of misunderstandings and chances to be together. Chibifying the characters during dramatic scenes were kinda dumb, those scene were supposed to make you cry not laugh and smile, but that didn't stop me from crying like a little girl. 
Art = - - the art is good! It is well drawn and animated. 
Sound= - - It's so calming and relaxed, when tension builds, the BGM builds up along with it. 
Character = - 
Sawako Kuronuma - Ai Enma and Sunako Nakahara's long lost sister. The Female Main Character, she looks scary that's why people made rumors about her being able to summon ghosts and monsters but in reality, is kind and loving person. 
Shota Kazehaya - Kazehaya-kun, the Male Main Character, very popular. He is always seen laughing and smiling, he is what Sawako strives to be, a lively and energetic person. 
Ayane-chan - one of Sawako's bffs. She gives Sawako support when she needs it. 
Chizuru-chan - one of Sawako's bffs. She likes Ryu's onii-chan. She's a delinquent but, she is one of the kindest people in the show. She and Ayane are the main jokers of the show. 
Pin-sensei - one word: ""EPIC."" 
Ryu- Kazehaya-kun's best friend, he has feelings for Chizuru. Is seen always asleep. 
Ume Kurumizawa - DIE 
Maru/Pedro Martinez - Cute. 
Enjoyment = - - After -- episodes of blushing, aww moments and misunderstanding, I grew immune to those kinds of animes. What i enjoyed most about the -- episodes of Kimi ni Todoke was Kazehaya-kun and Sawako's aww moments followed by either Chizuru or Ayane or both teasing them. Seeing both Kazehaya-kun and Sawako blush and get embarrass gets me everytime. 
Overall = - - I gave it a - because I'm a sucker for Happy endings. They finally got together! I would've given it a -- but no kiss.

There is a good joke right on start of this anime however this never happen again.  
You kind of watch it hopping that there will be a good joke soon but then you release that you just watched -- episodes of trashy anime and there is no fun jokes, so it is like a trap, they lure you in with that joke on start but anime itself is just so pointles like most harems, but in this case it is also not funny, not even a bit, like probably most unfunny anime i ever seen. 
So basicaly you got that uselesguy and some girls that like him for no reason and that is it. It is like those useless animes about making anime make up with random generated harem and have a baby. 
But its kind of amazing how unfunny this anime is, considering they try all time to make a joke and fail.

*SPOILERS FOR KOUTETSUJOU NO KABANERI aka KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS* 
I'm sure you've heard this question before: What do you prefer? Starting off strong but ending badly, or starting off weak, but ending strongly? Whatever your answer may be, this show falls into the former, like a rooftop jump gone horribly wrong. The first - episodes were this fun run with a few stumbles here and there, episode - was that big leap, and episodes ---- had this random train spawning from the sky to smash our fucked, airborne friend into the concrete below before exploding. I still had a good time all things considered, but there's a reason this earned the nickname ""trainwreck."" 
In the middle of an industrial revolution, an outbreak of armor-clad zombies known as Kabane has spread into a zombie apocalypse, and now it is up to the likes of Ikoma and all members of the Koutetsujou to hopefully out and end to it. Now, this show has some questionable things from the beginning, but with enough decent pseudoscience and explanations, we could've seen a really unorthodox and interesting zombie show. Instead, a lot of the radical moments weren't explained with decent and interesting reasonings, but were handwaved for the sake of plot and maybe time. It seemed like a standard story at first but with clever science, could've made for a really good and interesting steampunk zombie apocalypse, but then, with the lackluster villain, and the ludicrously safe and plot mangling finale, it unfortunately falls short of what it could've been. It definitely has more than its fair share of plot holes as well. I mean, it's a mess! Things like Kabane muscle memory and later, OP Kabaneri steroids don't get explained at all because ""action"" and interesting things like Kabaneri being resistant to heat, Kabane clinging on to each other to make a colony beast with one Kabane used as the heart, or the knowledge on how to halt and slow down the Kabane virus in order to be a badass Kabaneri get the same treatment. That is the sad thing. Plus, the motivations of our true villain Biba, don't add up with his actions, and well, and honestly, the second half was so stupidly and boringly written. 
Ikoma is a slightly more calculated shounen character whose traits I just mentioned flip-flop and clash with each other. Sometimes, it's understandable, like when he loses his best friend in EP -- for the soft and shounen side, and like when he has to kill actual people in the finale as well as Kabane because not every human is an ally, and not every human has shown a reason to be allowed to live when it comes to the harsher and calculating side. He's probably the best character here for being a remotely solid character. Plus, he actually feels real at some points, as well as his best friend, due to some of their reactions and conversations in times like this being what most actual people would do rather than just simple characters, like freaking out when they find out that their project for making a weapon to combat Kabane in episode - actually works as Ikoma kills a Kabane. Mumei, is a badass and jerkass in the first half, and a total child for most of the -nd. She has an interesting bit in episode - where her mouth and grim ideals get her admonished by her already stupidly jumpy and dickish co-passengers, but that's the closest thing to anything she has going for her as a character. Kurusu is just a samurai with a jerkass side, and Ayame, is barely any better, being that type of female authority figure that likes cooperation between enemies rather than needless violence, which only really gets to shine in the last few episodes. The villain Biba, is easily the worst, however. He's shallow, cold and calm, with grim ideals, and a vendetta against his asshole father that should've been fleshed out more so that we can buy into his motivations. His actions are pretty deplorable as is, so, meh. His death scene was the only time we saw any sparks of life in this husk of a character. At least one of his lackeys has some decency despite being kind of a rouge guy. Also, poor Horobi. She never got fleshed out, and she still managed to call her death. 
I do like how the first half of the show focuses on these unlikely allies on the Koutetsujou cooperating to defeat a common enemy despite being at each other's throats all the time, and how betrayal of that begrudging trust by one of the members in episode -- leaves a detriment in one's reputation, even if it turns out he was a spy to get our heroes some benefits later on, courtesy of Ikoma. If only we actually saw this with interesting personalities. 
Some awkward -D CGI in episode - aside, this show looks amazing. The fully detailed and high def look to the realistic art style really gels with everything beautifully, and the action scenes are well done with some incredible bits here and there. The explosions, spark effects for whenever a Kabane or Kabaneri gets stabbed in the heart, and the well done and detailed explosion effects are downright astonishing, even if there are some odd bits here and there with some action scenes. Hell, the art style is an epic update on that --'s OVA shading art style, and has numerous references to --'s art style themes, like Ikoma's cool new haircut in the end of episode -- reflecting they badass punk-looking character type in the --'s. Given that the character designer was Haruhiko Mikimoto, legendary designer behind the characters of Macross, Gundam ---- War in the Pocket, and Gunbuster. His work is legendary and I'm glad to see his stuff again, even if it is for a train wreck. The character designs look amazing, and more anime need this upgraded shading style. This was by far, Studio Wit's best work yet in terms of art. Just, look at how detailed and well done the character models, environmental and explosion effects, and backgrounds are! That's probably the main reason why many people like this show so much. It looks impressive and the action is bombastic and glorious. 
The music in this series has several tracks that are as catchy as they are fitting. This soundtrack was done by Hiroyuki Sawano after all; it's pretty much expected for him to knock it out of the park every time. The songs are definitely good, and the cola tracks are all great, and while they aren't all that memorable on their own, most of them feel like they were tailor-made for this series. Not one song feels out of place at all, and another large part of what makes the action in this show so breathtaking is how each fight has a piece of music that fits perfectly with what is going on, whether that be an action scene or that transformation sequence from Kabaneri Ikoma to Steroids Kabaneri Ikoma. Also, the OP, Kotetsujou no Kabaneri, is done by EGOIST, so of course it sounds catchy and awesome. The ED, done by AIMER sounds really cool too, and I wish there was some cool animation stretched to it. Plus, some of their songs were used in this OST, so good for them. Plus, ""Through My Blood"" (the song that plays during Ikoma's roofed out transformation) by AIMER is an awesome track as well. Also, WarCry (which is sung entirely in English) is pretty damn catchy. 
For the first - episodes, I absolutely loved this show. It was insanely fun, with several exciting action scenes and even a few good bits of banter. Too bad the show tanked after episode - aired. The group consensus for this show is that while it was entertaining and impressive to look at and listen to, it fell short of what it could've been via failure to explain its radical pseudoscience, and inability to give us a worthwhile final act and antagonist. I wholeheartedly agree. It's not nearly as good or satisfying as what it could've been, but it was a pretty entertaining show to watch, even if it turned out to be a total ""Trainwreck"".

We are introduced to the world of Bleach though the experiences of Ichigo Kurosaki, a fifteen-year-old high school student who has great personal spirit energy and happens to be able to see spirits. As a result of what appears to be an accidental encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami or &quot;soul reaper&quot; (literally &quot;death god&quot;), during which she is seriously wounded trying to protect him from a hungry ghost known as a Hollow, Ichigo ends up with her borrowed Soul Reaper powers and her mandate to protect human beings from the Hollows which try to prey on them. In the meantime, Rukia herself is stranded in an artificial human body and joins Ichigo as a student in his class, limited to being a guide for him until her powers return. 
Later in the series, the spirit powers of two other students in Ichigo's school will also awaken as a direct result of personal encounters with the spirit world; while a third is discovered to be a secret warrior in the ongoing battle to protect humanity from the Hollows. 
However, the series takes great care to emphasise that the vast majority of people live their lives without ever realising that this other world exists all around them. While the Soul Reapers have tools which assist this continued lack of awareness, they are rarely needed. Until Rukia takes on her human body, no one except Ichigo is able to see her. Even when Hollows are at their most destructive, most human beings can't see, sometimes even refuse to see: and many, including Ichigo himself, try to come up with rational explanations for what they cannot understand until rationalisation is no longer possible. 
In the central mythos of Bleach, humans souls come to the Soul Society at death, to be reborn years or centuries later into the world of the living in a vast cosmic balance. Even Hollows are not so much killed as freed from their unhealthy attachment to a world of which they should no longer be a part. The purpose and duty of the Soul Reaper is to protect this cosmic balance at any cost. Emotional and other merely &quot;human&quot; considerations have no place in the Soul Reaper's samurai-like focus on duty, a parallel further emphasised by the outfit of the Soul Reaper and by the symbol and focus of the Soul Reaper's power, the spirit-sword, or zanpakuto. 
White, the undyed or bleached lack of all colour, is traditionally a symbol of death and mourning in eastern cultures; but it is also the colour of emptiness and thus of beginnings. In Pure Land Buddhism, white represents the Buddhist interrum paradise where souls are brought to help them achieve enlightenment, and from which a few enlightened souls will return to help other Buddhists arrive at the Pure Land. (Interestingly, later episodes in the series make it clear that Soul Reapers were themselves once human.) In many ways black, its polar opposite, is also its complement: death, yes, but also enlightened awareness sharing its knowledge, wisdom, and power while seeking to learn anew. In English, the words &quot;black&quot; and &quot;bleach&quot; even derive from the same root word. In the black and white world of the Soul Reapers, the orange-haired Ichigo continually inserts a jagged element of awkward humanity into Soul Reaper abstraction. 
Like so many other top-quality anime series, Bleach is adapted from a manga, or graphic story (comic book), which has been running in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine since ----. While many manga-based anime soon run into the problem of getting ahead of the existing manga storyline, Bleach takes its time developing individual character storylines, and thus ends up with some of the best developed personalities in the entire field. Consequently this anime does demand a little more active work than most on the part of the viewer: but it is well worth the effort.

This anime is very unique and after finishing all the episodes I could say that it was ""worth watching"".  It is one of a kind because you can feel that each character is special and they were given a chance to make the story interesting. 
Unfortunately, I don't think there is an anime that is on par with the awesomeness of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu.  This is an exciting anime that you can definitely recommend because of the battle scenes, school stuff, personal life, motivations, ambition and many more. It brings action and school genre into a higher level which could make you say "" Hey, I want to be part of Class E and be  the one to assassinate Koro Kensei"". In addition, if you are looking for the ""best ending"" in all the anime then you better start adding this in your list or start watching it now.

-Spoilers Ahead- 
Here's the obligatory premise of the show for this review because I'm assuming you can't read the Synopsis up there due to allergy or something: Sora and Shiro have tremendous gaming skills and are bored with the regular world. A message arrives for the siblings, and when they open their message, they are stunned to see the scenery around them change to a world they had never encountered before. They've been summoned by Tet to...  
Yes, the premise is pretty much a carbon copy of Mondaiji-tachi. In fact, it's so similar that I had to actually check when the respective light novels were released. They're both about incredibly talented kids getting sucked into a different world because they're too special for boring human world, and they play ""games."" Even the visuals are strikingly similar in that they're both incredibly colorful. But hey, you can't exactly be always original- Technically speaking, every show could be considered a carbon copy of some other show that came before, and being uncreative doesn't really detract from the quality of the show. That's not the problem here. The visuals and music are fine too, although it does overuse that one track a lot when the MC explains his plan.  
But the visuals are the least of its problems- The two main characters, Sora and Shiro, are simply put, Stus. Everyone loves Stus as main characters, so why not? Izayoi from Problem Children was a huge Stu too, beating the shit out of everything with next to no effort, and these two are no different. They're just incredibly talented at everything and their only supposed weakness is that they have to be together at all times. Thankfully this weakness is actually never an issue except when it's relevant, and outside of that, it's played for comedic effects. And even if it ever would pose a serious problem, it's usually resolved by one of the two planning something out before the weakness actually happened in the first place, so it's just a pretend label. It doesn't make them any less of Stus. Unfortunately, many people seem to think this is actually a valid weakness, and therefore, doesn't make them Stus. It really isn't.  
At least they're not Tatsuya, right?  
They're not the only problem, of course. Stephanie Dora is this incredibly obnoxious character who pretty much exists for a comic relief. In fact, literally every episode involves making fun of this character for being stupid, and it never ends. So much that even the fanbase now associates her name with the term ""stupidity."" Making fun of a character for being stupid is funny the first time. Maybe the second and third. Not so much after when it becomes an established fact. ""Ha, the sky is blue! So funny!"" 
And then there's Jibril. Her introduction to the series is just so terribly done that it's almost offensive. There's no foreshadowing whatsoever to her existence, and when it's brought up, it just turns into ""Oh, Steph was stupid. Guess that's why she didn't tell us about this character that didn't exist until this point in plot."" And after she's introduced, she's mostly written as an exposition character that just explains all the world building for the watchers instead of letting the viewers figure things out by themselves. This also serves to mediate Steph's complete uselessness as a character because the author realized it wouldn't be a nice idea to have a recurring side character whose only purpose was to be a comic relief.  
I think simply claiming they're Stus isn't really enough to convince anyone, so I'll be more elaborate. But I can't exactly explain that in detail without explain this other thing. And that other thing is the title's namesake; Games!  
Maybe the series was trying to be clever with its title ""No Game No Life"" because there hardly is anything that can be categorized as an actual ""game"" in this series. The biggest problem with these  so-called games can be summarized like this: ""Oops, I win."" 
Since most of the episodes have games in them, I'll just explain how each was handled-  
First episode doesn't explain how Sora won the game. He just did, and you're supposed to accept it. Third episode is a chess game where the rules don't really exist. It's supposed to technically play like a chess, but there really are no established rules- If you're the main character and give a speech, apparently you're rigged to win. Am I supposed to be impressed yet? Fourth episode doesn't have a game, but it breaks character- Sora and Shiro are supposed to be scared of crowds, but in this episode, they get over it pretty quickly as if that was never a problem in the first place. Then they proceed to give an incredibly cliche speech about how the weak can become strong. A speech that's not even really reflective, since Sora and Shiro were never ""weak"" in terms of their gaming prowess, or inspiring since the speech was practically nothing. The entirety of fifth episode is Steph being called an idiot, and a sequence of games that just follows what the series did with the first episode. Sora just ""wins"" them all, and the few ones that he does explain how he won, is just completely out of some puzzle book. Brilliant.  
Sixth episode is where Jibril is introduced, and it's sadly considered one of the ""better"" episodes in the series. The game here could have been well done, but it's really just a mess. The game's victory hinges on the fact that Jibril does not know about the planet's structure. How could have Sora known this? What if Tet's magic world planet had a different structure from Earth? This is even before Sora had access to Elkia's library, so he wouldn't have known that wasn't common knowledge. Furthermore, Elkia isn't exactly the most knowledgeable nation- He claims that he supposedly figured out in the middle of a game by seeing how she reacted, but she could've been just as easily pretending. But it just so happens that she doesn't know about his win condition. It's a victory that just happened with assumptions and guesses, and apparently this is supposed to make the MC look like a genius. Really? 
Breaking off a bit from this pretend game nonsense, seventh episode manages to be the best episode in the series- Instead of Sora pretending he's smart over something he got completely lucky over, the audience get decently written characterization and not as forced exposition. That about sums up every compliment I had for this show. Everything afterwards just builds up to a very disappointing finale- Though, not before informing the watchers that Shiro is definitely helpless without Sora. Except not really, because Sora is still there, you see. What happens is that Shiro is supposed to play a piece on a board game that she can't see. This board game was being played by Sora and an another character. But apparently since she's a ""genius,"" she can predict where he's going to place the pieces, and know exactly where to put it. Except that, the game wasn't called Solitaire. I'm sorry, but it's logically impossible to exactly predict the game state of Othello from knowing just half of the game. Of course the show doesn't explain how this was done. It's just brushed off as Shiro being a genius and knowing everything about Sora, and that was the key to victory. It's all the more offensive when you realize that the victory of this game is what also later helps Sora to win the final game in the series in a domino effect.  
The finale attempts to make Steph seem relevant by having her pull the final trigger. Too bad she didn't actually do anything. Sora and Shiro planned her to do it! Genius! This last episode's supposed ""moral lesson"" is completely insensible too. It keeps repeating the line ""when was the last time you had fun playing a game?"" If people are putting something big like continents and people's lives at stake, it'd be borderline psychopathic to find fun from playing a game putting that at risk. I don't get the ""moral lesson"" here. Is this show telling me to completely disregard everything except having fun? I guess Russian Roulette was a popular party game too. Possible bullets to the head? YES! GOTY! --/-- IGN. Why aren't you having fun? Are you stupid or something? 
This particular game is also flawed in that their winning strategy also hinges on the fact that the enemy does not notice something that they later claim to be able to notice. Good thing they didn't the first time! Those stupid warbeasts! Even though an entire continent is at stake, they can't even put up that much of a caution! Again, this is not planning. It's luck. Sora gambles, and wins. You can't just win the lottery, make a smug face, and call yourself a genius. But this is what this show does. Every single time. It's not even pretentious in a sense that it's trying to do something remotely clever- Because it's not even fucking remotely clever.  
I also don't understand why Sora/Shiro are separate characters. Shiro is just literally Sora, without the smug attitude, being a fanservice bait, and doesn't have much of a personality outside of being incredibly clingy. The show also plays out their relationship far too much to the point that it's creepy. But then again, that's what these shows seem to do these days: Incest is ok, because they're not actually blood-related siblings. This show also constantly hammers in the point about how ""Blanks can never lose"" and that both siblings make up Blanks to an extent that it's incredibly annoying. Of course they can never lose- They're the fucking MCs and the plot bends itself backwards to LET them win. Furthermore, you pretty much know that Sora and Shiro will win no matter what. They always bet something to the point that if they lose, the series would probably be over, so you know that they can't lose. There is no sense of anticipation or whatsoever. Then after winning through some poorly explained method which this show constantly nudges you about how clever it was being, Sora just makes that same fucking smug grin.   
So yes. The biggest problems with the show supposedly about games is the games themselves, and the characters playing them. The series also constantly teases about how exciting things were before Tet became the absolute God. It's almost like it's self-aware. Lovely.  
This series could've been better if they didn't constantly play these games where cheating is more encouraged than making actual strategies within the game's boundaries. See, games are fun to watch because you want to see what the characters can do within their own boundaries to actually win in a clever manner. It's also fun to watch because you don't really know who will win. But due to the whole retarded ""Cheating is fine as long as it's not caught"" rule in the show, the author is given the freedom to not write anything remotely intelligent. All he needs to do is just say Sora won because he did something that was outside of game's design and that just made him win despite the fact that it would be near impossible in practice. And hopefully it's just as impossible for this show to get a second season.

SKET Dance became my instant favorite the moment I got into it, and it has valid reasons for so. It's one of the very few anime's which execute both the Slice of Life and Comedic elements perfectly well. -- episodes is not a very huge number considering the vast amount of entertainment it provides.  
So the story revolves around the fictional Kaimei High School, with our three members of the 'SKET Club' who aid the people in need of help, whatever their issue maybe. You may think at first the number of episodes for this show is too much, considering that it revolves around the very same concept of the SKET Club supporting the people and getting rid of their troubles, but there's more to it. SKET Dance has an extremely funny and a humorous nature that goes hand in hand with its plotline. With each episode there's a great amount of witty and comical jokes cracked and at times sticks to making parodies of other anime as well although that in comparison is very less than the original humor the show provides. Adding to the uniqueness of SKET Dance.  
Making a show with a school setting but at the same time the genre comedy being its core is not a very easy task to accomplish as it tends to have a lot of clichéd objects but this is where SKET Dance truly shines. While being humorous most of the time, SKET Dance also achieves what its actually about, helping others in need. Whatever their request maybe, with each and every episode our SKET Club manage to complete the task given and end that certain episode on a high note, while also being true and original every time. However if you are thinking that with each episode, no matter how humorous it may be or how good a finish it provides, it's inevitable that with the mixture of comedic situations and solving the problems of those in trouble and sticking with the same concept, it's bound to get boring at some point. But this is where the character development comes in to play. SKET Dance gives a great amount of devotion and concentration to its characters. Each of our three protagonists of the SKET Club, Bossun aka Fujisaki, Himeko aka Onizuka Hime (Also known as the legendary 'Onihime' in her past) and Switch aka Usui Kazuyoshi.  
Talking about characters, these are our trio of the SKET Club who support the ones in need. Bossun is the leader of the club, the one created the club and helped both Himeko and Switch join the club. For starters, Bossun is depicted as quite an unconventional character. He's not your typical cool-guy who overwhelms everyone else on talent on other things, but in fact the exact opposite of it. I don't mean to say that he's no help to the people and the club itself, it's just that he's never taken seriously. Compared to Himeko's brute strength and Switch's power of information, Bossun doesn't have anything you'd call a special talent. Or there's probably one, ""The concentration mode"" as he calls it. With the glasses he doesn't always wear and keeps it at the top of his red hat, when he does use it though it helps to go over the tiniest details and always help him solve them a case. Bossun is always overlooked at, and I don't mean in a bad way but in a funny way. As I said before he's not your typical cool character or some lazy ass guy who them goes on become a hero later in the show. However this does not in any way degrade Bossun's character and I'd say he's one of the most likeable protagonist around.  
Next is Himeko. Once known as the legendary delinquent Onihime, Himeko's past is quite irritating. Always feared by local thugs and students alike, Himeko is unable to make a friend for herself but that's when she encounters Bossun and things began to change for Himeko. Personally I love Himeko's accent, where she speaks in a different dialect than the usual. Himeko is a very crucial member to the club and they always rely on her strength which is her power in the time of need. Switch is our next character and he's a bit weird. He's a guy who likes crappy video games and always hangs around with his Laptop and so much so that he speaks with people using it too. Switch also is a hardcore otaku and has all the information stored about the students and teachers alike from Kaimei in his laptop which is always an helpful accessory to the club. I'd love to talk about Himeko and Switch in detail but I'm afraid I couldn't by giving away some spoilers. A couple of episodes are dedicated to both Himeko and Switch later in the show which tells the backstory of the two and it's very sad which will leave you teary-eyed.  
One of SKET Dance's trademarks is definitely its epic voice acting. Most of the jokes and humor is greatly accompanied by the way our characters react to the scenario, and in that aspect SKET Dance does it better than almost any other. There's a variety of opening and ending themes for SKET Dance both meant to be fun and dramatic varying from episodes to episodes. Many of the special episodes thrown between the show which focuses solely own its character has its own theme as well. The artwork is well synchronized with all the other elements as well giving birth to a highly entertaining and at times sad piece of work.  
SKET Dance does not follow a single pattern and thus is mostly episodic. In other words there are no separate arcs and it simply continues to follow it storyline. From the start till the end SKET Dance does not dissapoint you in any way. With light-hearted humor, sad moments accompanied by shocking plot twists, all play a very pivotal role in this anime. The inclusion of the Student Council Academy and its characters is important too, as they serve as a rival to the SKET Club but in a rather friendly manner. For the ones who are having a thoughts or two considering the length of this anime, I'd advice you to overlook it immediately as the fun it provides makes you forget about how long it is. In fact once I finished it I was left with hopes of watching more episodes. Make no mistake, SKET Dance ends perfectly well and does not leave the viewer any questions unanswered, but just as I finished SKET Dance I was beginning to miss the antics our SKET Club provided us. At the start of this show, I had planned on finishing this quick with atleast finishing three episodes a day. Considering how good this is and the laugh it provides you, I can tell you there are certainly some dull moments in this show when I stopped watching it for a while. Yes, the fact that is -- episodes long does come to light at some point, but that's all the more reason to take this slow and steady as the enjoyment in the coming episodes is endless as is the same for the entire series. 
SKET Dance is an anime that will definitely go down as one of the best within its genre and is highly recommended by me to anyone who likes anime with some fun and humor.

Have you ever seen a Naruto movie before? Yes? Good. 
Do you have the intention of watching this movie thinking it'll be something new? Yes? Alright, I want you to open a new tab and search up in Google, a montage of the ""Best scenes"" from this movie. Said montage will inevitably contain the much-talked about bath scene involving all the AU characters, a few scenes involving Naruto and his parents (perhaps Sakura if the person is a fan of that pairing), and his fight with the movie's big baddy (whom I won't spoil just in case, although if you don't know by now I doubt you actually cared about this movie much). 
Do it, truly, come on. I'll be waiting. 
Done? Congratulations, you do not need to see this movie anymore. 
No, I am not kidding. You've seen all this movie has to offer; You do not need to bother with it anymore. 
I am being as frank as I can be: This is what people for buying into it. No matter what they promise, it's always the same -- Their promise and promotion were bullshit, and ultimately it's another rasengan/shadow clone wank fest. It happened with the second movie when they promised us that Sasuke would be an integral part of it (He was barely there in the end), when they promised us that Minato would play a big role in the fourth movie (He was pointless to the story), it happened with the fifth movie (Or so I'm told, I was not following this one so I am not completely certain what was the case here), and now it happened with this, and will probably happen to the ---- movie too. 
Literally, the movie has no story; It's a holding pattern -- Naruto gets sad then something happens (he goes into the AU with Sakura), they faff about for like an hour, then the movie's bad guy pops in out of nowhere and with no explanation, ending with Naruto using a bunch of Rasengan and Shadow Clone and doing the whole ""believe in myself"" thing (Although, to it's credit, this one didn't end up with Naruto rasenganing the bad guy's ass, but rather with a fist fight, so there's that), even though said bad guy had previously nuked ENTIRE VILLAGES to ashes with a cough and the only reason he didn't vanish him out of existence with another nuke is because the movie didn't wanted him to. 
And, the biggest offender is that this wouldn't even be so bad if the movie wasn't so fucking AFRAID to go out of its comfort zone despite this being virtually an entire new canvas for work -- The much anticipated (and HEAVILY advertised) personality switches mean absolutely NOTHING to the story or plot and the explanations for them are entirely nonexistent, something that also wouldn't all too bad (it certainly wouldn't be good, but yeah), if it wasn't for the fact that they're literally only there for (Legitimately) FIVE MINUTES (ten, max); Naruto and Sakura get in the AU and immediately find Team - (Hinata, who now is mean and bitchy and one of the few characters with clothing switches, and Kiba and Shino who look the same and behave the same except instead being good with dogs and bugs, respectively, they're now bad with them), they runaway and find team -- (Ino, who now is shy and soft spoken, and Chouji and Shikamaru who essentially switched personalities, Chouji now being fit and stoic and Shikamaru being hyper active and dumb, although not fat, funnily enough), then Sasuke (Whom, despite now being a ""playboy"", is also basically the same outside of that, and this is literally pointed out by Naruto himself, plus a completely clothing switch), then that bath scene (No explanation is given for why they go there) where upon the last team shows up in medias res (Team Guy, compossing of Neji, who now is perverted and lacking in discipline, and Lee and Tenten who are the same except Tenten is now clumsy with weapons and Lee is a, well, I won't spoil just because the reveal of that makes for one of the better scenes in the movie), some faffing goes on before Hinata spots his cousin spying on the girls, causing her to get angry and attempt to beat him up until Lee shows up out of nowhere by falling through the ceiling (Much the same way he did in the manga preview, since the scene is essentially a reinacting of that with the personality switches), he runs away, they chase him ending in an actually pretty humorous scene, and then... They're gone. Literally. They just disappear, completely. They're not mentioned or seen ever again, with two exceptions: Shino, for no reason other than to show off his new found disdain for bugs (Him also being the second character to show no signs of change in the previous scene), and Sasuke who shows up two more times, one to give Sakura a flower (Which was in the trailer) and another where upon he flirts with some more girls causing Sakura to realize she's not a special case to him and making her sad. 
The rest is entirely going through the motions; Sad scenes with Naruto's parents (some of which are, admittedly, fairly poignant), who are also exactly the same with the exception of one trait that I won't spoil, a bunch of pretty damn useless fights and missions, and then the ultimate bad guy shows up, destroying the village and ending in a long fight with Naruto, before he goes back to his world because he doesn't want to be there anymore. 
And, I'm saying all of this with a pain, because this movie was one of thing that sparkled back my interest with the Naruto fandom (Where upon I got a lot of friends that I'm quite grateful for, even though I don't quite follow the series anymore those people keep me tangled back to it), and I really did wanted it to be good; I love its concept, I truly loved AU Hinata and the bad guy especially, and for the most part, while the animation is nothing outstanding, it's nice and pretty, a good treat for the eyes, ESPECIALLY on high resolution. But concept can never make up for lacking execution, and what the execution gave us was a reskinning of an already done movie with a more than questionable marketing campaign. Also, contrary to popular belief, the creator of the series, Kishimoto, didn't actually write this whole movie, he just designed the alternative characters and a few touches on the script and plot line, for the most part this was done entirely by the same thing that has brought us the same movies from before and that ""Gold mine"" of filler which makes the anime such a classic. 
Admittedly, this does make it a little less sad considering that if it really was written and done by him and this is all he could do then it would tell you just how much wasted potential this series has had to suffer. 
Still, all in all, what we have here is nothing more than a reskinned retread. There's nothing wrong with retreads, many forms of art have been essentially retreads of old formulas in order to explore new ideas, and, to a small (Literally microscopic) degree, this does explore new ideas. But at the end, we're still watching the same shit we've already seen with some added scenes of silly ""what ifs"" that amount to little more than ""what could've been"". 
I don't believe in scores, but I have to rate this, so I'll just go with - because it's in the middle.

Chibi Devi is a cute show that can be enjoyed if a person is willing to really suspend willing suspense of disbelief. I honestly know that this show is geared towards a younger audience, but did the subject matter really have to be sugar coated as much as it was? I felt the story line touched way too little on the downs of having a baby to take care of and way too much on the ups. I've read picture books geared towards this age group which covers the ups and downs in a better balanced manner.  
This story is really about how cute it is to have the baby and how much fun everybody gets to have. Babies aren't dolls, you have to take care of them the same way you do a pet.  You also can't go asking mom and dad for a baby sister simply because you think it will be a lot of fun, particularly since they'll be doing all the work. Very few problems that come from raising an infant come up in this Anime, and some of the things mentioned are a tad silly, like it is the memories that they make that matters. Last time I checked, babies of this age don't retain their memories from this time period when they get older. 
The characterization is what I expect of most shows for younger age range. It is simple and straight forward, using stereotypes and the characters lack any fatal flaws. Again, this is going to cause a major need to really suspend willing suspense of disbelief. That said, the characters can really grate on a persons nerves, particularly since I honestly don't expect any middle school student to act the way they do in this series. Aka... everything is based off stereotypes. 
The shows strong point happens to be its art work and music. The opening theme song is catchy and memorable. The art work is crisp and fluid, not to mention cute. While the characterization grates on ones nerves, the voices do not. Anyways, pick this series up with caution. It will honestly be a quick watch, forty-five minutes, but not everyone will have the patience to finish.

Hinata more like Can't win HAH (Does this count as a spoiler??? But yeah minor spoilers ahead. Be warned.)  
Story: 
Haikyuu!! is about a very short boy named Hinata Shouyou seeing another very short boy play volleyball and was inspired to play the sport. He gets to play his first match in his last year of middle school, but his team got absolutely smashed by the opposing team. That team had Kageyama Tobio, a volleyball prodigy that's kind of a jerk. Hinata wishes to surpass him in the future, but only to find out that they were in the same high school playing as teammates rather than rivals.  
My opinion: The story is very cliche and has a very textbook kind of narrative that every sports anime has. Practicing, then playing matches, reflecting on the things done wrong, and back to practicing. My main problem with the story was how the matches were kind of tedious and it was like watching Dragon Ball Z and how their fights lasted for so long. Of course that's a stretch, but it does certainly feel like the volleyball matches were a little too long. Mind you, the story isn't bad. Not at all. It's just very mediocre. Haikyuu's strong point is not it's story and that's just fine. It's generic, but it's done really well. 
Art: 
The art is amazing. Beautifully choreographed and very unique. The faces are very distinct and they don't all look copy and pasted into different templates. How the artists managed to draw volleyballs is beyond me (its harder to draw then it looks). The animation feels very smooth and crisp. It's very bright and you can feel the energy. What I like about it most though is how it can really make up for the matches that seem to last forever. The animation makes you feel excited and keeps you interested no matter how boring some parts of the story get. 
Sound: 
The soundtrack has a very mixed variety, which I love. There's a lot of energetic songs that make you just want to jump up and dance, but there's also some sad pieces that are quite heart wrenching. It's great, but some are forgettable. I found out about Haikyuu a few years ago because SPYAIR, a band I love, released their music video on the opening they sang for the first season. I did not want to watch Haikyuu because of the annoying fans in the comment section that were mainly talking about Haikyuu rather than the amazing song that SPYAIR sang for it. I should've picked it up faster, but the anger got to me. Anyways, SPYAIR is an awesome band and if you liked the opening they did for the show, please check out more of their content. 
Characters: 
For this, I'll just talk about the main characters and my favorite side characters. 
Hinata Shouyou- This guy is just really lovable and adorable. Unlike another energetic brightly colored protagonist I know, he's not as annoying as I thought he would be. He has determination, which makes up for his lack of skill and intellect. He's a character I thoroughly enjoy because he has flaws and he compensates for them, but they still shine through. He doesn't let people underestimate him and I'm glad that a protagonist exists where they actually want to make friends with people. It seems like the trend nowadays are brooding characters that aren't very social... 
Tobio Kageyama- I freaking love this guy, no matter how annoying he is. He's so bossy and arrogant that it makes you want to punch him in the face, but when he actually fails, it makes you feel really bad for him. All he really wants, like anybody else in competitive sports, is to win. He's a sensitive and childish twat, but he's quite endearing. I love they dynamic chemistry Hinata and him have because he gets frustrated really easily and seeing him yell at Hinata just brings laughter to me every time.  
Nishinoya Yuu- This guy is my guardian angel. He is the definition of SUPPORTING character, like he's literally supportive. He's fun, he's loyal, and he's fast. He kind of reminds me of Sonic. He and Tanaka are absolutely hilarious together, especially when they become masochists once they see Kiyoko in their sights. I love how he tries to name volleyball techniques like he's making up some Naruto jutsu. It's adorable.   
Tsukishima Kei- This guy. THIS GUY. He reminds me so much of me because we both would try to rile people up just for the laughs. He may seem pretty generic, but I think there's some more to his character than we think. I like to think that he's a class - kuudere. (Give some bromance to your friend Yamaguchi man. I feel so bad because Yamaguchi's best friend is this asshole.) 
The rest of the characters are cool, but some of the other teams seem to have the same personality types as them. I like these four just because they all seem pretty unique to me, but that's only because the two of them are the main characters. Of course they have to be distinct. 
Enjoyment: 
All though there are some flaws, I immensely enjoyed it. I wouldn't consider re watching it though. I'm also not gonna try to read the manga because I want to be surprised for the seasons to come after, no matter how much my friends have already spoiled me. 
Overall: 
I give this anime an -.-/-- but I'll bump it up to - just because. 
I like this show. I wasn't expecting to like it because most sports anime tend to let me down since they usually end up to be more fan-servicey than it is about the sport. This was great though. You can tell that all of the interactions were genuine and that all of the guys are there to play volleyball and win. To close it off, here's my favorite quote from Haikyuu!! 
""The last ones standing are the victors. Only the strongest. If you want to be the last one standing become strong."" -Kageyama Tobio 
Thanks for stating the obvious Kageyama.

It's hard to write a good story about prophecy or time travel. These concepts inherently introduce complicated causality, and a writer must plan carefully and precisely to avoid the degeneration of his story into tangled nonsense. You can't just make up anything you like and hope it will work out. 
I suppose that can't is the wrong word. Mirai Nikki is an eloquent demonstration that you *can* do just that - and that you can make money doing it. But you will doom yourself to the gruesome fate of those who create profitable but inferior works: unending, hellish ridicule from strangers on the internet. 
Communicating the full depth of Mirai Nikki's narrative failures is a daunting task. It almost feels as if it was strategically designed this way: its final episodes introduce so many new concepts so rapidly that it's hard to keep track of them all - and harder yet to accurately assess which ones provide redeeming qualities and which ones make the story even worse. That kind of minute detail-oriented evaluation is inappropriate to a review and would be wasted on Mirai Nikki in any case, so we will have to abandon the endgame mess now, having mentioned for the record's sake that it exists. 
Mirai Nikki is contrived. The characters' personalities and motivations are constantly rewritten by single events, in accordance to what the plot demands. It's rare that the anime portrays a sense of conflict, even when the characters are betraying the very principles that they held all their lives. A dedicated morally upright policeman turns into a pragmatic extremist in an instant due to his son's terminal illness. A shy, self-effacing, weak-willed boy sees his parents die and instantly becomes a capable, merciless killer - and then reverts to his childish self a few episodes later. A four-year old becomes a calculating, murderous sociopath after a few days away from his parents. This is nowhere near comprehensive. The majority of the character progression is on this level. Mirai Nikki has pretensions of being a psychological story, but no one with a shred of capacity for critical thinking can believe that human beings would act like its characters under any circumstances. 
The calling card of the contrivance is that so much of the characterization proceeds from singular causes. Yuno provides the perfect example: her obsession with Yukiteru emerges after a single meeting where they discuss a middle-school assignment. I don't imagine you need me to tell you that's preposterous, but just in case: that is preposterous.  
The dialog explicitly claims that she falls for him because she has nothing else, but it's unbelievable. A person on the edge of the abyss becomes cynical and slow to trust. She does not attach to a stranger so powerfully for so little. The effect doesn't match the cause. Mirai Nikki does this constantly: it communicates its ideas in a brutish, artless manner. Single arbitrarily initiated traumatic events cause massively exaggerated psychological effects. These suddenly-introduced changes erode the supporting characters. They don't have individual identities. The story forces them to become whatever it needs them to be. 
It has to be stressed just how poorly written Yuno's character is. Despite -- episodes worth of constant screen-time, her character never ascends beyond the cliche and the one-dimensional. It's convenient that she possesses no morals or desires outside of Yukiteru, because it makes her easier to write. These things could produce a sense of conflict or a change in the character, which would be more difficult to think through than defaulting to psychotic protectiveness of Yukiteru, the single response she repeats for the whole series. This is a problem because it means that, as far as Yuno's character goes, around -- to -- episodes are a complete waste of time. They don't tell us anything new about her. One might be inclined to forgive her slightly for being such a cardboard cliche, because her character is partially responsible for codifying and popularizing the yandere concept to begin with. It wasn't quite as cliche at the time, but appears so in the present, when we're familiar with all the imitators. But it's a double-edged defense: it means her influence was - and I mean this technically - cancerous. The yandere is a caricature. Narratively speaking, she makes everything in which she is involved worse. 
Near the end, there's an important plot twist surrounding Yuno. It's related to a mystery that was established earlier in the series, but I suspect that Esuno, writing the manga, came up with the mystery long before its resolution. That resolution has a false start with no impact and then a final resolution which lacks anything like foreshadowing. It reveals that Yuno had knowledge, throughout the entire story, which she has never acted as though she possesses. 
Yukiteru's character arc is farcical. He spends the majority of the story slowly making his way through the typical shonen protagonist arc, gaining confidence and strength as his adventures progress, and then he skips to being a jaded badass near the end - until he needs to become weak again, just as instantly, for the story to go where Esuno wants it to go. Then his newfound pragmatism vanishes, never to return. 
The main psychological theme of the story is the consequence of child abuse and abandonment. It exaggerates that concept until it's rendered meaningless. By the ending, it is communicated that such traumas are the sole deciding factor between a normal life and total, unmitigated sociopathy or mental degeneration. It's laughable - it has no resemblance to genuine human behavior, because people are too complex for such one-dimensional profiling. Their actions are decided by a multiplicity of motives and experiences.  
The contrivance is not actually in service to any theme or statement. Its goal is to take you on a ride. No one could possibly believe the --year-old episode is a thoughtful depiction of child psychology. But it could be amusing as a set-piece. And if Mirai Nikki has any value at all that type of appeal is where it lies. It certainly doesn't come from the animation, which is cheap and lazy: it often resorts to near-static shots or uses slightly trembling ""cutouts"" of the characters from the waist up to represent walking. It would have to be excused by comparison to other badly-done TV anime of the same era, but it could never be celebrated. 
With respect to amusement value, the introduction of Akise Aru is worth mentioning and that character is the highlight - for what little that's worth. He's amusing at first because he turns the established order of the series (Yuno destroys everything) on its head and there's one moment with him near the end that made me laugh out loud because it was surprising and audacious - both on the character's and to a lesser extent the creator's part. The real crowning moment comes from Yuno wearing a rabbit suit. The laughter I got out of that part would have been worth a couple of episodes on its own. The show also displays some competent pacing and tension-building in the early episodes, before it's clear how monumentally dumb the story is, at which point it's for naught. Investment becomes impossible. 
Mirai Nikki certainly isn't funny enough to justify itself. Much of it is too serious-minded or too cliche or just too dull. That entertainment value is a small redeeming quality in an exceptionally poorly thought-out narrative.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hyper critical when it comes to Fairy Tail. In fact, you can reference my other reviews and ratings to find out just how much I love the main series and the manga (its a lot by the way..... a lot). But this film just didn't sit well with me. I sat through the whole thing and thought to myself 'this is where I should be getting that Fairy Tail feeling.... but I'm just not'; which is a shame because I literally woke up at -AM in a fit when I remembered that I had forgotten to watch this film. 
So now I ask you.... What happens when you take an entire Fairy Tail arc, one that could have been decent, were it properly written and presented, and try to cram it into an hour and a half of pandering and catchphrases? 
A -.... thats what happens. 
Story - 
I will admit, at first, the premise of this story interested me. Not as much as the main series has but it was still OK. By the end of the film, after --- scene switches, - minutes of fighting and some cheap attempts at emotional responses later, my interest had gone. Its not that the enemy was dull or overestimated... that almost always happens with Fairy Tail (the overestimated part at least). It was more a case of there being f*ck all at stake for Fairy Tail, they had nothing to do with it in the beginning, the person at the center of it all isn't from Fairy Tail and by the end of the film, they aren't even fighting in their home town, let alone in their own country. 
Additionally, everything in this film is so rushed that you can't even establish a proper atmosphere before moving on to the next place. This causes it to lack a much needed amount of depth and results in a badly scripted mess. 
Art and Sound - 
This is Fairy Tail so you know that the sound is worth praise. Its got most of the original sound track in which is what bolsters it to an -, but its not a -- because these songs are used like the characters catchphrases, things that don't fit but need to be in there to cater to the fans and make money. 
As for art, its was looking good, better than a typical episode of Fairy Tail but that can be expected from a film due to the raise in production value. 
Character -  
I love Fairy Tail's characters, hell, I've made numerous points about how if they were anybody else, this franchise would be more than mediocre. However in this film, they are literally used as soundbites. Extorted for their catchphrases and humorous traits. They don't communicate much and don't talk with anyone except their 'fan-fic pals'. As I said earlier, pandering and catchphrases. 
Otherwise, the characters are good, you just dont get to see that because they are being made to dance for change on the street. 
Enjoyment - 
No 
Conclusion - 
This is not Fairy Tail, if you need extra Fairy Tail, read the manga, if you finished the manga, go to their subreddit or something. Just, spare yourself from this film, its nothing more than an excuse to boost the franchises value.

The only reason as to why I will grant the anime a petty - is due the artwork - and because of their choices regarding voice actors for the characters.  
Otherwise, the serie is actually pointless to the last bit. It promotes rape, and no - you can not deny this fact. -- seconds into the story and the main character, being the girl (Yui), is pinned underneath some creepy casanova with red hair and a huge appetite for petite women with blood inside their veins. No thank you. I get the deal; they're vampires - oh yeah, they must starve for blood. But really? This was almost exceeding my limits. It DID exceed my limits, and as a member of the female gender, it was absolutely horrendous to watch how Yui was pushed around by the several male characters. It makes the viewer get a very bad view of her, since we only get to see her cry; and do absolutely nothing about the pests bothering her, other than her whimpering; ''no - stop!''. They even told Yui head-on that if she even as much as tried to escape, they would kill her. The males were complicated and downright unreasonable - disgusting.  It was painful to watch. 
It may be appealing to people who may enjoy the blatant display sadism,  a horrid brother complex that will never be resolved and a sad, sad love story. As in;  VampiresxBlood. Ongoing ladyboner, excuse me. (Notice the sarcasm).  
I'm not sure what the creators wanted with this serie; there was absolutely no character development. It was almost too much to watch how it always ended up with Yui begging for them to stop harassing them, and further more, it was more of a contest for the males.... as in; who can scare and harass Yui the most - and in the process get a hunch of blood, too? How about no. 
Sure, we did get a view of the character's background stories, but that didn't leave much information anyhow. It was just unfinished; too short - very grim altogether.  
I can at least tell you that I had fun watching it because of it ridiculousness. I didn't watch it myself, I admit - it was more of a erratic event for my friends and I, since we kind of ended up screeching together or laughing because of the circumstances throughout the serie.  
Absolutely pointless otherwise.

Before you read this, there are spoilers, so um if you like those-YEAH, READ ON! (I'm trying my best not to spoil, but um yeah how can you not?) 
This anime scares.  The episodes leading up the ending genuinely scared me.  Seriously. 
So, I'm believing the plot was basically all leading up to this, all of the experimentation on humans.  I never really did believe that the humans and vampires were doing human experimentation until the episode they actually showed one of the 'test subjects.' I thought it was all a lie for Mika to get Yuu to come with him.  Little did I know he was telling the truth, which was honestly very surprising for me, which led me to getting scared.  So, at the end of episode --, it shows our new protagonists, Yuu; Mika; Shinoa; Kimizuki; Narumi; Yoichi; and Mitsuba. They are currently running from the humans and the vampires, doing their own thing, which is what Mika always wanted so yay for Mika! 
Here's my actual review for the anime! : 
Story : -/-- 
At the beginning, I honestly very much liked this anime.  It used to be one of my favorites.  That was before I realized how very terrifying this actually was.  It reminds of a lot of giant Western franchises, as well, which is why I ranked it just a tad bit lower, ONLY because it might've just been a coincidence that this reminds me of so many things. 
The story actually wasn't that bad in the beginning (TT^TT), though it was meant to take this dark turn, which wasn't really that dark, considering some things. 
Art : -/-- 
If I had actually watched this in HD (no, I don't use illegal streaming sites, or free streaming sites), it would've been AMAZING.  But to me it just looked like your average anime.  The animation, however, is amazing and must've been very hard to pull off, with Yuu transforming into the Seraph of the End, and the way some of the weapons have very unique textures and forming sequences. Overall, pretty awesome. 
Sound : -/-- 
I always rate anime sounds high. :/  
The music is amazing, reminds of when Sword Art Online was actually good.  But it doesn't remind me that much of it, which is amazing.  It also gives me a very nice vibe of uniqueness that is very hard to pull off.  The voice acting was amazing as well, which is NOT expected from what I was guessing it to be. 
Character : -/-- 
There are three basic supernatural your character can be.  Human, vampire, or demon.  Pretty cliche unhumanly types, vampire and demon. 
The character development is there, it's just that you can get so much into the anime that you can't notice it, or you DO notice it because Yuu keeps saying ""I'm much stronger than before! ;)""  Other than that, you can notice that there is a lot of character development, but it's not very interesting, just in my opinion. 
Enjoyment : -/-- 
My enjoyment for the first season was way different, due to the fact I kinda... watched it in a day.  But for this season, I just watched because  
-. cliffhanger 
-. the community 
-. the constant build-up of hype for the second season. 
Overall, I would score this anime a -, maybe a -.-, still deciding whether or not I'll have nightmares.

Just some quick advice with this second series, don't start watching it too late.  
It's a wonderful series and develops their relationship and reveals more of the other characters stories. I absolutely love the Princess Kaguya style of artwork which sort of slips in sometimes, the animation I think is rather beautiful.   
I give the above waning only because the development in this second series is much slower! It is still enjoyable because it just reveals how awkward communication can be especially at their age and it's different that things aren't rushed and each moment is complete before moving onto the next.  
I recommend watching this if you loved the first series but the speed of the episodes can make for frustrating late night watching as it does keep you hooked.

""I don't want to die. For me, that is the only reason to keep fighting. There is nothing to save myself for or give myself to. I fight because I know nothing else."" – Guts 
The hype and popularity surrounding Berserk is insane. Being both the seventh most popular Manga and best voted Manga on MAL, fans of the franchise had high expectations for the animated TV-Series, which was released back in ‘--. Easily noticeable by comparing the score averages of both the TV-Series and the Manga, people didn’t quite like the animated Series as much as the original Manga. Nowadays this adaption gets appreciated much more than it used to be, since the new installment of the Series in ---- skips entire character-arcs, lacks everything which made the atmosphere to be so good and most importantly, got animated with the most terrible and meme-worthy CGI so far. However, Berserk ’-- is not only good in comparison to the ---- version of it, it’s phenomenal in its own right. 
In this review, I’ll try to elaborate, why I think the old adaption of Berserk should still deserve more attention as it gets nowadays. As someone who experienced the whole series unspoiled, meaning that I've only started to read the Manga after I watched the actual show, I can hopefully bring some insight into why this show deserves all its praise and definitely should not be considered a bad adaption in any way. Additionally, to protect myself from the angry minority who haven’t spoilt themselves about Berserk’s story yet, I’ll give out a warning, that this review is NOT completely spoiler-free. 
The Anime starts off roughly -- years after the actual happenings which the ’-- will feature in the first episode, seeing in what our protagonist developed due to his past. So basically, the animated Series solely covers the prologue of the Berserk Manga, also known as the ‘Golden Age Arc’ for Manga veterans, with only the first episode covering a different story-arc and initiating the flashback. 
Even before the covered events in the TV series, Guts’ childhood has been for the shitter. He was born by the hanged corpse of his mother, raised and forced to fight at a young age by the mercenary Gambino. By killing foes and knowing nothing but battle and brutality since his early ages, Guts has become the person we see in Episode -, an incredibly talented mercenary, gifted with sheer brute force. 
Still, in his young age, Guts is seen to be teaming up with the “Band of the White Hawks” and its mysteriously talented leader Griffith, aiming to gain more influence in its kingdom and doing so by repeatedly winning battles and holding a proud ---% win-ratio in that. 
Berserk’s story is nothing short of being magnificently executed, both in storytelling and world building. The gritty, dark, medieval fantasy world feels incredibly realistic and just as ruthless. This is possible because of Miura's writing in terms of politics and realistically evolving character relations, which almost leaves no room open for criticism. Also a huge thematically relevant part of Berserk’s story is the feeling of being extradited to the point where one might question himself, if one’s actions do not even matter in the grand scheme of things, leaving the question open if it is all fate, or if there’s room to struggle against it and change future for the better. This feeling is omnipresent in Berserk’s story, successfully depicting Guts’ and the Band of the Hawks’ struggle against different opponents and obstacles. Especially Guts’ imagination of being invincible gets brutally scattered in the fight with Griffith and Zodd, a non-human being, absolutely destroying Guts in battle in the first half. His discovery of the very idea of reason and friendship wrapped up by the very artsy and faithful execution this show provides is nothing short of being an absolute blast to watch all the way through. 
The characters in Berserk do not fall short of one’s expectations, with the relationships of every fleshed-out member of the Band of the Hawks being exceptionally realistic and well executed. The relationship between Guts, Griffith and Casca has to be one of the best in Anime history, if not even being the best in terms of complexity. Also, minor characters do not seem to be underdeveloped or bad, even though you do not get to know too much of them. If the show knows one thing for sure, it is to get you to like even the douchiest of all the douches if he’s on the side of the Band of the Hawks, which alone is a pretty outstanding accomplishment. 
The one segment Berserk seemingly struggles with, is the department of Art/Animation. While the Animation really is inexcusably bad, even compared to other titles published in the --s, like for example ‘Neon Genesis Evangelion’, the Art did fit the overall atmosphere really well in my opinion. The harsh and realistic art style complements the overall atmosphere of the Berserk Anime oozes a lot of. Freeze-frames are used very often during its runtime, which are done by the probably most competent man to execute them, Shinichiro Kobayashi. Both, his backgrounds of landscapes, villages etc. make them feel lively in just a few seconds and some of these freeze-images are true work of art. It makes this adaption of Berserk feel like a more poetic, artistic approach to the manga's source material and is actually an ingenious way to adapt the extremely hard to translate source material in animated form. 
The OST of Berserk has the single best Track I’ve ever heard, namely ‘Forces’ by Susumu Hirasawa. It’s a shame that Hirasawa did not contribute to many more Soundtracks in different Anime, because the OST in Berserk really IS that unique. And by unique I mean just f-ing amazing, probably claiming the G.O.A.T. spot of soundtracks on my list. It won't go out of your head anytime soon, even more, due to the fact that it sounds that unfamiliar and creative compared to usual Anime soundtracks, taking Hirasawa's chanting during 'Forces' as an example. The single tracks are the best I've heard so far, without lying one bit. 
The only point of criticism I can voice is, that there are simply not enough tracks for a -- episodes long Series (~-- minutes of actual soundtrack), which is a pity, because these -- minutes did an excellent job on contributing to the right atmosphere. I would have wished for more diversity and tracks, these problems drag it down just a lil' bit for me. 
It should be noted, that the problems I’ve mentioned in Animation and Sound maybe could’ve been avoided if the studio OLM (the studio who, ironically, is famous for producing Pokémon) had more budget. I don’t have the exact numbers, but it could be possible, that they didn’t have enough, to begin with. 
Conclusion: 
Berserk is a phenomenal Anime, filled with brutality, gritty atmosphere, HAI YAI FORCES, and complex character relations + development. To top it all off, it even is able to raise philosophical questions, which both trouble the characters during their development and should be answered by the viewers themselves. While it still leaves room for legit criticism in terms of Animation and the most obvious ‘read the Manga’-ending I’ve ever seen, it should not be left out by veterans and specifically not by Berserk newcomers.

I've just watch this special, and I got to say, when they say ""Special"" whoa, they mean it, co'z what it is was an uncensored much awaited --th episode (if we can call it that way). But actually it was suppose to be episode -- since the setting took place in the observatory where she met other witches and Kotori there hasn't been captured yet, but then again, the OVA would have been regarded as a filler episode, so frankly for an OVA to have a story would have been pathetic since it was still related to the parent anime. S I'm gonna present my ratings for this OVA. 
Story: Pathetic -. 
Please refer to the above explanation. 
Art: Very Good -. 
Tbh, the rating was for the uncensored fanservice, and that's that, no further explanation needed. 
Sound & Character: Mediocre -. 
Since it was still the same seiyuu who did the character's voice where I have no comment with, except the fact that I still hate the opening and closing theme. Also, the character were still the same where the guy is still the decisive character where he doesn't know what to do with his harem, and them harem girls still competing for the guy's affection. Though, in this OVA the competition for the guy's affection went intense. 
Enjoyment: Good -. 
Tbh, it was the uncensored fanservice that got me for the most part, also the intensity for them girls to compete for the guy's affection also somewhat got me but barely, since, the ending was nothing and it was pretty much depended on the parent anime as a whole. 
Overall: Dreadful -. 
It was nice but, imo it should've been included as one of the parent anime's episode, since that's what the OVA is and I'm sorry if there wasn't more I can say, in fact I probably won't blame them mods if they take an interest to remove this review.

If you're not sure whether to watch this show or not, watch it. Right now. 
Kobato is a relaxing, very enjoyable show. But it starts a little slow, but that's the enjoyment, it's relaxing. But I guess you could say ""As expected from CLAMP, starts slow, and then with the twist and turns and the feels."" 
Story: 
The storyline is good, very good. Since it's written in the summary, I will not write it. I will give it -/--. 
Art: 
The art is good. Perfect for the show. I will give it -/--. 
Sound: 
The sound is charming, with perfect soundtracks in the perfect moments. The song Kobato sings is very relaxing (for me) which just adds up the charm of the show. I will give it -/--. 
Character: 
I guess I could say the character development was good. I'm sure you will get attached to them. I will give it -/--. 
Enjoyment: 
I enjoyed it really much!! I like how it's slow paced, but takes up the real thing in no time. Literally, everything in this show is just perfect! Watch it right now, I guarantee that you will not regret it ^^ 
PS. I don't write much reviews. This is actually my second one. But this anime made me write a review, it's just amazing. Not to mention the first review I wrote was also one of CLAMP's work, Tsubasa Chronicle. CLAMP is just amazing. Slow paced, but then suddenly twist and turns and feels right in your face.  
Kobato will be a feels train in the final episodes, be mentally ready (altho that won't help, you'll cry anyways) but, you are warned. Now, watch it! :)

Watched -- episodes of Eureka Seven on me Ipod. I have to say that this is a very good anime. I mean, the storyline is well present, with some unexpected slots in between that will makes you think a little bit about what might happen in  the future. 
I won't compare the art of Eureka Seven with Transformers, because they are totally different class of it. Transformers is more like robots fighting with robots but with Eureka Seven, I feels its more like people fighting with people, with good cause, of course. 
Can't complaint about the sound, because they got the sort of music that I really heart ! Music with that anime is a very good compliment I have to say. 
Development of the character is one vital element of the anime. Without a good growth of the character, the storyline will be trumble. Eureka Seven makes sure that this not happen, by plotting the suitable situation with the correct character. Brilliant. 
Enjoyment ? One of the best. 
So far, this is my favourite as it contain many elements that I fancy with, such as against the war, environmental and human life. Good good good !!!

Words are poor. All letters, cyphers, whole sentences... Do we really need them? 
Yes... they are poor... 
Look at this little house. A house from cubes. Little croocked, looking like a baby's toy... and an old man inside. But not a single word. But the what we see is so meaning. Thigs, gesture... even when we are forgetting how to write, how to speak... the memories and some pictures in our minds are still with us.  
An old man was building floor after floor... to escape from reality shttp://myanimelist.net/myreviews.php?seriesid=----&go=writeomehow. But as he was building it... he lost the reason for this. He was hunted down by his own routine. A picture with a woman... but just a picture. Pipe, fishes, wine, TV... 
But when the past started to hunt him again, he just gone up and builded the next floor. From the routine.  
But thanks to the thing that is routine actually and that suppose to have no meaning... He was forced to dive into his memories. Thanks to fact he missed... a pipe... So many of them he had, but... he missed it somehow. 
As he was going deeper and deeper, he started to remind some things, some gestures, some situations... he remembered all things that created his life. 
And the he saw house from below once again. He looked from the very ground on that he built... a huge an beautiful and cosy home. But did he built it himself?  
Now the house is drowned, abandoned , like other houses that surrounds him. Because people alredy moved and left memories behind... like he will do also. 
One day there won't be another brick to put... 
One day there won't be enough strenght eve to raise it from the ground... 
Or maybe there will be so many floors that house will collapse? 
Or maybe there will be so many floors that there won't be anything on a new builded floor? Because on every floor he left something... forget something important... 
But till that time... a wine, a picture, a gestures from a past saves him. 
In this very moment... he know why and for who he lived and will continue to live!  
Untill a memorey of him will be also drowned... 
Thanks nyan! >^_^<

If you like sad storys about love, dreams and the lives of young people you just have to love ef-a tale of memories. It is one of the first anime which is not a fighter anime i ever watched and it was fascinating for me to see how touching a story like this can be. To the story i have to say (without spoilering anything), that it consists basically out of - different main storys in - different cities. Normally i would stand critically against splitting it but in this case it made the story even better with all the ups and downs. The art is also very good. well but thats only my opinion you may think of it otherwise. One of the things i enjoyed most about this anime are the well developed characters and their backgrounds. In addition the music to each situation is just great and fits so well. Till now i only said good things about it so i will also tell you why its not a straight -- for me. For me personally the story is ,if watch the anime the first time, developing a bit to fast and you may have to rewatch it to understand everything. There are also some scenes they could have made a bit compacter and better. But overall i have to say it is a really good anime and i can only recomend it to all people who like this kind of anime. I normally dont crie easy but i have to say when i watched it the first time i had to a couple of times.  
Ps: sorry for any english mistakes i made here and i hope you enjoy watching it :)

Unoriginal, uninspiring and ugly, this OVA lacks everything that an original video animation must have.  
The story is told in a lame and boring way and it would have been better if it was stretched in more episodes to fully make out the story. After an accident long ago, some creatures from Mars have been appearing on Earth and a group of young girls fight them together with young man fight these creatures. The only interesting revelation comes at the end but solves nothing. 
Looks really dated with characters looking ugly from afar. Nothing looks good at all not even the aliens. The sound was maybe a bit better than anything else but poor compared to anything else.  
The fact that girls fight aliens should be good but it's not. The girls themselves aren't really fit for the part but none of them are really good at their job.  
Unless you are looking for a terrible OVA to give it a bad rating, Mars of Destruction awaits you, otherwise there is no reason for you to watch this considering there are hundreds of better anime today.

Usagi Drop may sound like a very mundane anime from the description and synopsis but it is different from the mainstream anime that is popular at the moment. 
Now if you're looking for some weird fetish between a loli and a grown man, you are definitely in the wrong place. Usagi drop is a nice slice of life anime that warms the heart with moments that can be shared between a tight-knit family. I myself am a young adult male and I found myself thinking to the future about having a daughter of my own and sharing a close bond with her too. 
The fact that the guardian in the story is still learning to be a parental figure makes the story even more interesting because it shows the growth of Daikichi as a guardian and Rin as she is literally growing up. 
The art style and animation is pastel and soft which helps the lightheartedness of the series and is good for this type of slice of life anime. 
The characters are ones that you grow to love and the relationship between Daikichi and Rin is one that will warm you to the core because of how innocent both characters are as they become newly formed family. The secondary cast also provide great comedic relief but also act as a ""foil"" to enhance the main characters. 
If I could improve something about the anime, it would be the problem of Rin's biological mother. Rin's mother is briefly mentioned and problems between her, her boyfriend, and her internal struggles are introduced but not gone into. 
Overall, I enjoyed this anime and would recommend if you are looking for a nice anime to watch as a break between other hectic action-packed anime and are looking for something to calm down to.

I've reviewed a lot of Studio Ghibli films. In January of ----, one of those films was The Cat Returns. During that review, I mentioned that it's a spin-off loosely connected to this film, Whisper of the Heart. Now, that film was pretty good with plenty of strong elements. Let's look at Whisper of the Heart and see if the same holds true for it. 
Story: 
Shizuku has a pretty easy life. Her parents are easy-going and she has plenty of friends and lots of time to read obsessively. One day, she notices that all of the books she gets from the library seem to have been checked out by the same guy before her. She's curious about what he could be like and, by sheer coincidence, meets a guy she doesn't know. I'm sure these two plot points are completely unrelated. The film follows Shizuku in her daily life with the focus on two major facets, her budding romantic interest in the boy she barely knows and her coming of age and learning what she wants to do and trying her hardest to follow it. 
The biggest flaw with the film is the romance aspect. Our two leads are still in their pubescent stage and, frankly, they have about as much chemistry as Argon has with anything. Yet the narrative treats their barely started relationship as important and serious. I give them a couple months together at most before they break up. The coming of age element, however, is pretty well done and it elegantly illustrates what it's like for someone to discover their passion and immerse herself in it. Aside from those two elements, the film is pretty tedious with very little of interest happening. Honestly, it can be really mind-numbing to slog through. 
Characters: 
The characters in the film vary. Some of them are quite dull, having only a really basic purpose to fill before being banished to wherever trite characters go when they've done their bit. Shizuku is a pretty fleshed out and developed character. I will say, most of the characters have enough to them to have verisimilitude, even if they don't ultimately contribute to the narrative all that much. 
Art: 
The artwork and animation are the best aspects of the film. Both are really well done in classic Ghibli fashion. So, if nothing else it is a very pretty, nicely detailed film. 
Sound: 
The vocal cast and music are both pretty middling. They're passable, but not good. The stand out performance has to be from Honna Youko, who is coincidentally going to be featured in next week's series too. She does do a really good job, but you also have actors like Tachibana Takashi who just sound bored. The music is fine, unless you really love or hate the song Country Road. Which does get a bit over-used and could start to wear on your nerves, especially if you aren't kindly disposed towards it to begin with. 
Ho-yay: 
There really isn't any in this film. 
Final Thoughts: 
Whisper of the Heart is not a good film. It isn't bad either. It's just a film with a dull narrative, bland characters and excellent artwork. If you really like slow slice of life works, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, I can't really recommend it. Especially when Studio Ghibli has so many really strong films that are filled with intrigue and adventure. My final rating is going to be a -/--. So, this month we've looked at Nuku Nuku Dash in honour of Hyashibara Megumi month, Yuru Yuri San Hai in honour of yuri month and now this in honour of Ghibli month. Next week we harken back to last year's magical girl month with a look at Futari wa Precure: Max Heart.

Are you new to anime? Or are you a veteran? Well, with ""NHK ni Youkoso!"" it doesn't matter! This is one of those anime that you can easily get through, want more, think about it's message and wonder how such a masterpiece isn't more popular. Not only does this anime entertain it's audience with a wonderful story, a variety of characters, great sound affects and great music, but it also teaches the viewer about the difficulties of social anxiety and psychological disorders. There are only a handful of anime out there that handle such delicate subjects and shower them in brilliant dark comedy. Anyway, before getting too worked up in my intro, let me start my review.  
Story (--/--) 
Unique, complex, entertaining, slow paced and utterly brilliant. The story of this anime is so beautifully constructed, executed and structured that it took me a while before realizing how amazing it really was. The synopsis is already provided so I won't be summarizing anything here. In fact, I'd recommend reading the synopsis before continuing to read the rest of this review. The story telling in this anime is such a roller coaster of emotions that it's honestly pretty exhausting sometimes. Most scenes had me in the brink of tears from either laughing too hard or watching something painfully realistic and relatable. It starts off with a lot more comedy in the beginning, but the further you go, the more bittersweet moments you find. The romance is also pretty realistic in the sense that you'll NEVER see the main couple be LOVEY DOVEY. I think some people might dislike this anime a lot because it doesn't necessarily rely on the suspension of disbelief like other anime. True, there are a lot of weird/funny hallucinations the main character sees and hears, but almost all of the situations throughout the anime are believable. Anyway, this isn't the only anime to tackle on the whole ""society is a bitch"" idea, but it's one of the few to actually do it in such an efficient, painful, smart, and entertaining way. Honestly, I could go on and on about the story, but I think you guys get my point by now.  
Art (-/--) 
Before judging the artwork of this anime, keep in mind that it was released in ----, almost a whole decade ago. Although it's not the prettiest artwork or the most innovative, but I do think the artwork fits the genre and story perfectly well. With that being said, there'll definitely be moments when you'll be thinking ""wow this anime is a lot more beautiful than I thought"". Just like the themes, the artwork has this extremely grungy, old school, somber feel to it. It also reminds me a lot of Cowboy Bebop for some reason. Which obviously makes this anime that much more awesome. All kidding aside though, there is also a good variety of artwork throughout the anime. You'll notice a difference of quality in scenes depending on the setting. Scenes where Tatsuhiro is at the beach, the park, or in the city are a lot more visually pleasing than when he's at home. Facial expressions on every character are also unique and interesting. Overall, the artwork perfectly suits the anime.  
Sound (--/--) 
The opening and ending songs of this anime are really good. Not my personal favorites, but easily in my top --. That aside, the quality of the voice acting in this anime is ridiculously high. Each voice actor feels like they're perfectly suited for their role. The sound effects during hallucinations are great and most of the time extremely hilarious. My personal favorite by far is our main character, but that's only because he gets the most screen time(duh). Music during scenes are perfectly intertwined with the situations in the anime. With music you sometimes forget it's there. However, if you've watched anime for a while you can't help, but notice what a big role it plays in most scenes. There's a wide range of music that vary from playful to extremely sad and depressing. It's pretty stunning.  
Character (--/--) 
This is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. Each character has a purpose. Every character grows, fails, learns, and maximizes their potential as a solid character. There is no such thing as a ""weak character"" in this anime. It's actually unbelievable how well written, well developed and well exposed every character is and how that justifies their existence. Not a single character feels extraneous or even annoying. It almost feels like every character has tragic hero qualities.  
Enjoyment (--/--)  
I LOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEE THIS ANIME!!!! It's definitely on the same level as Toradora, Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke, Clannad/Clannad: After story, Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, etc.  It's worth watching, re-watching, purchasing, and remembering. It was painful to watch, it was hilarious, it was bittersweet and underrated.  
Overall (--/--) 
Notes: I did write this review a few weeks after watching it, but my feelings and perspectives towards it have not changed. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for something unique and highly interesting. I'm not going to lie, you have to be a little mature to get some references and relate to it fully.

How do you end a six year legacy that has helped revolutionized the way people see -.-D idols? This is the answer.  
The Idolm@ster franchise may have kickstarted the whole idea but it is without a doubt that Love Live! especially μ's made it become a cultural phenomenon nationwide in Japan. Don't get me wrong, I love both series. I am an idol fan myself. I played the Xbox --- port of the original Idolm@ster game and have known about μ's since it debuted in ----. It was because of Idolm@ster that I got into the world of idols in the first place anyway. 
Onto the actual review of the movie - it was highly satisfying. It's the final show with a set-list of - new songs going into μ's Final Love Live. Sunny Day Song is my favorite μ's song. It was nice of the writers acknowledging the international popularity of the series and decided to include a K-On! Movie style trip overseas. The usage of a mysterious character personifying Honoka's inner insecurities is highly plausible. Not many slice of life series use this particular plot technique as far as I can recall. It was also theorized that the character is actually the adult version of Honoka but the movie intentionally leaves its viewers to utilize their imagination and determining the significance of her character is all up to one's personal interpretation. To me, the main message of the whole movie - the whole series even, is that even with unreliable wings, everyone can fly. The question is whether or not you're willing to risk falling and try flying again. The mysterious character helped emphasize that message. The first scene showed child Honoka jumping across a huge puddle albeit slipping into the puddle a few times. Heck, in the first episode of both season - and -, Honoka jumps. She jumps a lot. It's a recurring theme. I may be mistaken but the first trailer of Love Live! School Idol Project when it was first announced in ---- had her jumping as well.  
What would happen to μ's once their third year members graduated was answered towards the end of the second season but the movie gave us a further glimpse of what happens to Otonokizaka High's Idol Research Club once all of the remaining μ's members, the first and second years, graduated which leaves a - year gap after μ's disbanded. This is important to take note as Love Live! Sunshine starts to take place at the end of the movie as well but was not particularly mentioned so far. Maybe it is saved for next season.

This got me back into Anime, for which I am extremely grateful. 
To be honest the artwork was less of a preoccupation of mine while watching it, I wouldn't say that it inhibits the show in any way but neither did it blow me away - it worked just fine. The story is great, if somewhat hard to relate to the characters at times, but incredibly creative and enjoyable none the less. 
The sound, from what I picked up most - the intro and outro music -  is amazing, quite possible some of the more enhancing music I've heard to fit an anime, regular tv shows do this often so it was nice to get that immersing feel from beginning to end. I even found myself picking up on when a set track would reappear to reflect a specific mood such as tension, which is a lot more thought than I would normally put into a soundtrack, so good one there, hooked me musically. 
Again, the characters much like the story reflect a highly creative mind and are nothing but immensely entertaining with the variety that are featured, I'm pretty sure there will be someone along the line that everyone can enjoy. 
Fantastic! Just gotta wait for second series now!

Okay, so as a younger man learning about his own sexuality, I adored this anime and the romance of an older man taking and caring for a younger boy. This was a highly romanticised idea in my adolescent brain. 
Coming back and watching it again, ten years later, I find myself exceptionally uncomfortable. This story is about a paedophile grooming a boy (yes yes, technically he is a hebephile, but general society does not see that distinction). I guess, due to age, I identify with the adult of the series more than the child, and as an adult I find this repugnant. 
I had to drop it, refusing to watch it again. 
If you are young, and fantasise about being with an older male, this will appeal to you. If you are an older male who fantasises about being with a young boy… well, get counselling. Seriously. Or stick with shounen-ai or yaoi that is more age appropriate and, well, less paedophilic. 
I can't speak for how a fujoshi might view this, but for me, this is a definite no. Probably doesn't help that my tastes have moved more to bara these days.

Psycho-Pass is many tales. 
It is the tale of a group of people having their freedom stripped away and having to deal with it. 
It is the tale of a girl thrown into a world of dark, disturbing events and tragedy, being forced to cope. 
It is the tale of two people who grow to care for nothing but each other, but it is far from being a romance. 
In my time watching Psycho-Pass, I grew a fondness for the characters therein. There were times I hoped from the bottom of my heart for the well-being of a character, and other times I wished with all I had for a character to suffer. Despite this, I still felt the impact of a character's death no matter how much I disliked them. 
The Psycho-Pass anime shows a world in which no one has to make their own decisions, nor do they want to. Many of the characters are outcasts of that world, those labeled ""Latent Criminals"". Their lives were taken from them by an unfeeling system that found them too dangerous. 
At no point did I feel at all left out of anything. Psycho-Pass presents itself as a powerful, thought-provoking piece. I see it both as a philosophical statement, and as an emotional experience. Never has an anime made me care quite so deeply for a character, let alone its entire cast. I can honestly say Psycho-Pass deserves the highest praise. I highly recommend it to anyone willing to invest themselves into a deserving story.

Banner of the Stars III is supposed to be the conclusive arc in the grand saga of the Stars franchise. And conclude everything it does, till it has engulfed all of humanity's future in a brilliant blue tint of regal oppression, covered over with a sweet, crooning romance. 
Let me get two things out of the way, so you can walk away if you feel offended: 
-) I believe the Abh are the real villains of the show, and there's actually a genuine reason the people hate them so much: these people are blindly self-justified aggressors at heart. 
-) Worse still - the show is actually aware of this, and deliberately distorts the picture to make Abh-haters come off as terrible or pathetic human beings. In this regard, this show is shameful on a level that no other anime I know could possibly match. 
Given the above points, there's actually a good reason I decided to pursue the sequels after witnessing the moral horror that was Crest of the Stars. The thing is, I happened to catch a glimpse of the end-credits of this show, and they seemed to paint an entirely different kind of picture - it seemed to end on a tragic and poignant note that finally seemed to acknowledge that the Abh and their ways weren't so noble or beneficial after all, and that people were suffering because of it. This one admission would have given the show's developments an entirely different meaning, and redeemed the entire franchise completely. That was what made this show seem so promising. This is also the reason I even bothered with Banner I, because it seemed to build up to this deconstructive conclusion (however, I skipped Banner II as just reading the synopsis made me want to throw up). Long story short, it proved to be an extremely misleading picture, yet again. 
A brief introduction - the show starts in the aftermath of yet another battle between the Abh Empire and United Mankind (the humans aligned against Abh expansionism). Our protagonist Lin Jinto seems to have suffered some injuries from the war and wants to take a break from the fighting. Our other lead, Lafiel the Abh (also Jinto's girlfriend by this time), decides to join him. Jinto is an ordinary human appointed as head of his conquered homeworld by the Abh overlords due to hereditary circumstances, and Lafiel is a member of the Abh royalty, one of many individuals directly in line for succession of the throne. Jinto's homeworld Martine is vying for independence from Abh rule, and at the heart of this movement is Teal Clint, incidentally a close confidante of Jinto's now-deceased family. This is the backdrop in which this roughly hour-long OVA begins. 
For much of this brief show, Jinto revisits old places and old acquaintances. Everywhere he goes, his well-wishers try to stuff some sense into him, to no avail. Jinto is convinced that what he is doing is for the best. The show also reveals the final clincher about the Abh that should leave no doubt in anyone's mind about just how sinister the whole setup had been all along. And in the face of all this, the show puts up a loving, smiling face - as though it just treated you to the most wonderful developments ever. 
Now, I've reviewed the first two installments without having to drop any spoilers, but here it's simply impossible to criticise the show without getting into plot specifics, because not only is it here that it indulges in its worst ever dishonesty, but it's actually far worse than the previous installments, and stoops to a level so low that it needs to be explicitly pointed out to be appreciated. With that in mind: 
----SPOILERS FOLLOW---- 
First he meets his old childhood friend Que Durin (the sole friend who saw him off to Abh country in the first series, if you recall), offering him a post where he can assist Jinto with various administrative matters. When they meet at his place to sort out the details, Durin confesses his reason to distrust the Abh in what is a stakes-changing shocker of a revelation  - to eliminate the possiblity of revolt or in-fighting, the Abh are genetically hard-wired never to be able to turn on their superiors, and despite any possible grudges or resentment find it practically impossible to disobey orders (the phrase ""I was only following orders!"" gets taken to a whole new level of creepy...). Jinto himself reveals the final piece of this puzzle - which is that by mandate of Imperial Law, any ethnic Terran (i.e. ordinary human) members of the Abh nobility are only allowed to conceive genetically-modified children who would be physically full-fledged Abh - blue hair, body implants and all. The picture that emerges is a system where everyone born into nobility (and therefore important positions of power) are blue-chipped humanoids who have more in common with a random Abh than with their own parent, and effectively no free will....this is even worse than I could have ever imagined. I'm simply at a loss for words here. And it's no coincidence that this vital piece of information was withheld until the very end of this franchise. But the even more horrifying part is that the show makes his apprehensions out to be ultimately unfounded, and that it's precisely these qualities that actually make the Abh GREAT. Give that a minute to sink in. 
In the middle of all this, there is an even more crucial development. Jinto's home planet Martine has been vying for independence from Abh rule (and the show has the bloody audacity to refer to the Independence party as the ""Feudal government""). The Abh retailate by destroying their planetary defenses under the pretext of a drill-exercise goof-up due to miscommunications. And then - here's the singular worst part - the blame is shifted on the Independence party for forcing the Abh's hand, and they are accused of ""coercing the dissenters into submission"" by activating the defense system and thereby forcing everyone to get on board with the independence movement because there's ""no turning back now"". ""No civilised person with a decent undertsanding of the galaxy would do this - these are the ignorant actions of an isolated Lander"" is how an Abh conveniently puts it. The show tries to suggest that only ignorant and misguided individuals would want to try and seek independence from a forcefully-occupying power that they never wanted any part of in the first place. It also implicitly suggests the most singularly bald-faced lie ever, which is that the majority of the population would NOT want independence from such an invading/occupying force, because of which one would have to resort to such underhanded measures to get the population on board...I can no longer help myself here, I just need to vent out that this is singularly the most shameful, two-faced and obscene notion that this show has so far hurled at me. 
Anyways, things being what they are, Jinto decides to do damage control and visit Teal Clint - who is the acting Prime Minister at the helm of the independence movement. A decent man, an honourable man, someone with spine to stand up to the Abh. Someone who saved Jinto's hyde (sorry about the pun) when his very life was at risk. Jinto ought to be grateful to this guy. And also to his wife Lena who doted on him as a child and went just as much out of her way to make sure he was safe. Instead, he has chosen to side himself against the very people who saved his life (whereas the show makes it out that it's the Abh whom he owes his loyalties to). But the two don't care about any of that right now, they just want to see their boy again - such is the love they have for him. The most heart-wrenching part for me was when Jinto replies that he has responsibilities now, to which Lena tearfully retorts, ""Responsibilities as an Abh? As an Invader?"" She speaks for all decent individuals with that line. Anyhow, Jinto agrees to visit, and they are tearfully overjoyed to see him alive and well - and desperate, Clint suggests what I personally had been practically yelling all along (in my review of Banner of the Stars I, if you recall) - give up the Abh title and return home clean by seeking political asylum. The Martinian people would have understood - the title was forced upon him when he was too young to consent, and he was personally not guilty of any wrongdoing at the time.  
But it is here that the show gives its singularly most insincere pretext in the entire series so far for Jinto to side with the Abh hegemony, and moreover for Clint to give up on independence - if Jinto steps down, any other person appointed in his place will ""not be so generous"", and so a war might break out, putting Martine's very existence at stake. I might even have agreed with that stand (on a strictly short-term and tactical basis, mind you) if Jinto was portrayed as being CRITICAL of the Abh at heart but just playing along so that his homeland can have a future, but it's abundantly clear that he has been completely bought into the Abh way, and is very much in line with their program (there is a telling scene right before that meeting where Lafiel tells him, ""This is Your battleground""...). This is where I think that the rationale is deeply insincere and two-faced - it seeks to present Jinto as a neutral and unbiased player in the game when in fact he is anything but, and thus give more credibility to that line of argument. And in any case, just by taking such a stand, Jinto has all but explicitly incriminated the Abh to be coercive thugs ruling with a velvet glove covering an iron fist. But does the show even acknowledge this? Nope. It diverts your attention to how Jinto feels sad at no longer being allowed to return to the forests and the beautiful landscapes of his homeworld, but it pales in comparison to the peerless, radiant beauty...of Lafiel. ""Life's too short to live in depression and regret"", the show croons. How sweet, how romantic....someone please kill me right now, I can't take any more of this. And as if in answer to my prayers, the show ends, right there. 
----SPOILERS END----- 
Ultimately, the show actually voices legitimate criticisms of its own premise through these two associates of Jinto, but then covers over them with the most shamefully insincere rationalisations. The blame is shifted on those who refuse to go along with the Abh hegemony, as always. Even at best, the scenario is portrayed as an unfortunate or unavoidable outcome of unfavourable circumstances when in fact the Abh are completely to blame for what has happened. And all of this is glossed over very expediently, and the focus very quickly shifts to some other issue before you realize anything is amiss - and in this department, Banner III operates far more slickly than its predecessors. Come to think of it, the only reason for this made-on-the-quick OVA to exist seems to have been to coyly deflect the most threatening of legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against the show's basic premise. 
So...back to Earth - Banner of the Stars III does end on a tragic note, all right. It is the tragic end to all human freedom, not just Jinto's privilege to visit the planet that he unilaterally lords over. But who cares, because he is ensconced in the sweet and caring arms of the most beautiful, wonderful Abh princess, for the rest of his boot-kissing life. And the Abh will take over all planets (because that is their ""destiny"", and one they themselves daren't question) and thus finally bring about lasting peace to all of mankind. The End. Seriously, am I the only one here who needs to throw up? 
Anyhow, it's getting late now - here's my final verdict on the entire Stars franchise: the Stars aka Seikai series isn't Love in the Time of Cholera - it might as well be called Love Cholera. Fans of good Space Opera ought to look elsewhere - the appearance of intriguing political complexity  was an elaborate facade to intellectually overwhelm more casual viewers into passively accepting something they would otherwise have puked at. Fans of good romance ought to look elsewhere - all the coy romance between the two leads takes place whenever the show needs to blindside you to the utter and complete hypocrisy of their interactions with the outside world.  
Heck, fans of good Sci-fi should look elsewhere, because what actually seemed like a genuinely intriguing and promising sci-fi concept about (seemingly) progressive-minded genetically-modified space-faring humans, turned out to be so creepily monstrous and subversive that it makes even the most depraved eugenic ideologies of the past seem tame by comparison. If you look at it closely, its premise is actually closer to those presented in classic dystopic literature - except here it's presented as something wonderful rather than horrible. Its status as something of a ""classic"" among old-school anime circles is, IMO, an unfortunate case of people being taken in by its serenely operatic atmosphere and its fairly engaging and believable character dynamics, and failing to see that it's all in the service of some especially sick and reprehensible ideas. The people who made this show ought to hang their heads in shame. Seriously.

To start with the good news, Owarimonogatari is a breath of fresh air in this rather stale year in animes. The bad news? While its second half provides hints of what was the aftermath of Kizumonogatari film to be aired next year, it is one of the worse arcs in the Monogatari universe. 
Story and Character: -/-- 
The Sodachi Lost Arc is an oddball even by Monogatari standards. It started with solving the supernatural right away then proceeded with detailed explanation behind the titular character in the arc. The pacing is slower than normal albeit more even which gave enough time to layout the foundation of this fantastic case and the characters to develop well. For the plot, it is straightforward this time and avoided some irritating Monogatari quirks that marred the show. 
Every character was utilized to the extent that removing one of them leads to the series' failure. Sodachi, in particular, stood out given her neurotic nature and her background which justifies why she hates Araragi. Ougi, on the other hand, is still an enigma to the viewer but is not as abrasive during her presence in Shinobu Time so she gets a pass. The arc also gets a big plus because Araragi is not portrayed as your typical loli-loving pedophile but as a person who is trying to resolve some issues in the past and is trying to find the missing part of him which he repressed in his memories. Moreover, the Sodachi Lost Arc explained as to why Araragi was like what we saw through the course of Monogatari series. 
In that sense, the first half of Owarimonogatari could be viewed as a coming of age story because Araragi and Sodachi managed to settle everything between them. As for Araragi, he finally reconciled with Sodachi. As for the latter, she is now able to move on because she found what she hoped to look for. (Spoiler: It's not romantic in nature) 
The end product is a compelling and emotional piece that is reminiscent of what Monogatari can offer in its prime.  
The second half? Not so much. The disappointment could be from the unrealistic expectation Owarimonogatari brought but it is no doubt that this arc is one of the subpar ones in the series. The majority of Shinobu Mail did what your typical bad Monogatari episode does: there was too much talking that did not move the plot. 
The bad omen began when this particular arc opened with Araragi and Kanbaru had their banter which was seen too many times in the series that the jokes grew old. Gaen talks too much to the extent that her ramble took half of an episode with much of the details flying to the viewer's heads. The comedy in Shinobu Time didn't help either. This is because we already saw those jokes and there are certain points in the series where you have to really know Japanese to appreciate some of their gags.  
Which was a shame, because the premise of this arc could be the more nuanced than the first arc. We have Shinobu and her first minion showed again after being supposedly dead for --- years. How cool was that? Instead, we get an unnecessary slow arc with Gaen side trips and loli-tripping that took four episodes to be good. The output is just as emotional as in Sodachi Lost Arc but the way this arc was executed was really questionable. 
Sound: -/-- 
Again, Shaft is still excellent in providing the right music for a Monogatari show. It knows how to employ OSTs with fast beats when the characters try to come up with something and strings when things go dramatic. The soundtrack helped both arcs in reaching the emotional impact the studio wants. The OPs and the EDs are also strong in this one which is typical for the Monogatari series. 
Visuals: -/-- 
Now that's where this series excelled. While it may not be able to beat One Punch Man visually, it succeeded in entertaining its audience by its visual quirks. Keeping an audience awake over the span of -- minutes is a tall task if the characters are just talking for most of the time. Shaft pulled every trick from its sleeve that ranged from visually fun (Araragi and Kanbaru's BL-centric banters) to entirely neurotic (Araragi's class search for the culprit). 
Enjoyment: -/-- (-/-- for Sodachi Lost Case and -/-- for Shinobu Mail)  
Owarimonogatari still stands as one of the best shows in ---- due to the lack of competition. However, if the second arc is the indication of what will happen in Kizumonogatari, it's getting real hard to be excited for the next Monogatari series.

K-ON! is inconsequential fluff. One might compare it to popcorn or cotton candy: a tasty treat, but if you're looking for a meal, it will leave you looking for something more substantial after it's done. 
K-ON! follows the tried and true formula of cute girls doing cute things. Based on a --koma comic, the series is about several high school girls who form (technically join, but all the previous members graduated) a light music club and follows their activities. The music itself often takes a back seat to the antics of the girls, and audiophiles may find themselves somewhat disappointed if they go in expecting detailed attention to techniques or references to real life bands (there are a couple, but few and far between). There are two concerts in the thirteen episode series, but neither is as impressive as the one from the Live A Live episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (one of Kyoto Animation's earlier shows), but still very enjoyable. The most common scene in the series features the main girls sitting in the club room snacking on tea and cakes while discussing various mundane events, particularly with the more dedicated girls trying to get the rest to practice. 
The girls all have their own distinct personality. Yui, the main character, is the some clumsy and adorable airhead. She joined the club hoping to play an easy instrument like the castanets but ends up playing guitar because the club needed a guitarist. Ritsu is the energetic idiot of the show, drummer, and club president because she was the one who dragged everyone else into the club. Mio is Ritsu's long time friend, and the sensible, serious one of the group. She writes the groups songs, and plays the bass. She is also the most moe character, being the prettiest, easily embarrassed, and terrified of ghosts and yucky things. Mugi is the pianist. She comes from a wealthy family, and thus is a source of amusement by displaying the difference in wealth between rich people and normal people. She is also the provider of the tea and sweets that are regularly consumed at the club meetings.  
There are a few regular minor characters, too. Ui is Yui's younger, but more mature and reliable sister. Yui has a friend named Nodoka who joins the student council, which means her role is essentially to let everyone know that Ritsu has forgotten something regarding paperwork for the club. Sawako is a music teacher who is recruited as the club adviser in one of the more memorable scenes of the series. Also, a late addition to the cast is Azusa, an underclassman who is much like a miniature version of Mio. 
Character designs are generally cute, with the kind of big round faces typical of most Kyoto Animation works. Background art is consistently good, as is the animation, which should come as no surprise. When characters are shown playing their instruments, there is generally more attention to detail than seen in anime to the point where the sound properly matches the characters actions. The singing at the concert features the same style animation as Live A Live, where you can just about lip read the lyrics (if you know Japanese, of course). 
The music used in the series can generally be described as light and fluffy, both the background music and the couple of songs the girls play at their concerts, with the exception of the closer, which rocks a little bit harder than rest. The voice acting fits well all around, with Yui being notable for regularly coming off as someone who isn't all there, fitting her character well.  
I don't want to close saying this show is like Azumanga Daioh with a music club, but that's about the easiest comparison I can make, and not too far off a description.

Both classic and unpredictable, this hilarious romance comedy isn't like any other and is a succes to what it is doing. 
Never judge a book by the cover they say. Most of the time I don't agree with that sentence because most of the time, romance High school comedy are just... predictable, cliche, boring with characters that are everything but interesting. 
History: 
When I said classic earlier it was about the history. This is the story of Hikigaya Hachiman, a pessimist high school student which has a negative (but often true) point of view of high school life. We follow him and his club which goal is to help people that ask us. He has no intention to go into that club and has been forced by his AMAZING teacher (You'll love her too). 
That's about it for the story. Of course it's not a memorable one but those types of anime can't really create a unique story and we can't really note that. 
The only thing in the story that changes is that the ""cliche"" situations seems to fit in more naturally and you never say ""Yeh that's only something you'll see in a anime"". They are both predictable and welcome. 
Oh and by the way, I love the little twist at the middle of the anime. Really unexpected and welcome to add it withouth feeling forced. 
Art: 
I'm not a person focused on art very much and I don't really rate an anime with is art in mind. Unless it's something brilliant or very awfull I don't mind. 
Yahari Ore blablablabla is ""Okay"". 
Sound:  
Op and ED are both good and I didn't skip them. Music in the anime fit to the situation (even if I usually hate sad music to sad moments) and are very discreet. 
I really found the voice amazing with a lot of tones that differs really fast, good job ! 
Characters: 
HERE IS THE AWESOME PART. 
This is the strongest point of this show, and the most important one a creation should fullfill according to me. 
You'll love all the characters, even Hikigaya Hachiman, the main male character/outsider. He has always that unique point of view that is pessimist but that also describe really well the real world. You'll love his monologue about the hierarchy of a class or the natural selection of people (I don't know if i'm clear). 
He is both creepy and awesome, you know why he doesn't  have friends but you also know that he is really intelligent. Like a real character, sometimes he doesn't know how to react with socials interractions he doesn't know, he is always CONSCIOUS about what he going on and he always stays true to who is is. 
Plus he is hilarious and knows when a situation does look like one you would see in a anime. 
Yukinoshita Yukino, one of the two main female character, looks like Senjougahara (Monogatari series). She has no close friends because she looks perfect: rich, beautifull, intelligent. However she is wayyy to straightforward which makes that no one likes her. She doesn't care about what people think of her and she is determine. And no, she isn't a tsundere, because she knows when she has to seek for help or anything else. 
A really Unique and complete characters. 
Discussions between her and Hikigaya are just hilarious, the two of them see the world differently and conversations are both hilarious and intelligents, just like Monogatari conversations too. 
Yuigahama Yui, the second main female character is the glue that links everything. At first I thought she would be a a character on the back, but the more you know her, the more interesting she becomes. In a way she is the opposite of Yukino, but not that much. You'll love her too. 
Supporting characters are excellent too, the perfect man, the otaku guy, the fucking teacher they are amazing. You'll burst into laugh with the reaction of Hikki towards the cute boy (Even more that the one in Stein's gate). 
Enjoyment: 
When I saw this anime I was always like ""Fuck yeah"". Finally a good romance anime that can make me laugh so bad and that has really strong characters (the exact contrary of clannad in my opinion). 
I really think i'll watch it again in future days just cause it'll make me feel good again. 
Overall: -/-- 
I want more of this, I want a season -, I loved it and i'll recommend it to anyone. I try to be as objective as possible though and the only things that disturbed me a little is that it's a perfect romance/comedy high school anime but it's still ""only"" a romance/comedy high school anime. 
For me it's the best one so far (Toradora and Clannad are overated imo) and I'd love to see what comes next. 
For all bakemonogatari fans, you'll love to look at that, and for others, you'll love to see strong characters for once. 
For now, I'm out, this was my second review so please comment and give me your feedback !

I've always despised reviews which compare manga with their anime adaptations. But after watching hinamatsuri, I've come to know the pain of the reviewers who wrote them, for the first time!!! 
If you laughed at jokes of ""school rumble"" then hinamatsuri will make you laugh -- times more. 
If ""Disastrous life of Saiki kusuo"" made you laugh once in - minutes then hinamatsuri will make you laugh twice in that duration. 
If ""Detroit metal city"" killed you with laughter by using sex jokes, beware for hinamatsuri will make you laugh in the same way but without anything sexual at all. Hinamatsuri is one the most comedic gag stories written. 
Even with all these praises, you must be wondering, so what the hell with the given rating???? 
Well, all those things you would experience only while reading the manga. But the stories used in anime is also the same, so why isn't this anime good????? 
Two important things a gag anime should have and this doesn't have is: 
""Timing and execution"" 
Without those two the whole purpose of a gag anime is ruined. While watching the anime, the execution was so slow that you wouldn't even notice if that was a joke. Many times I had to think back a few seconds and make a discovery- oh this was a joke and it seems I have to laugh. 
The most important mistake done here was that this anime was made as if to give you smile at the end of the day, like a person goes through lots of trouble in the episode and he/she gets a happy ending by the end of the episode....which is really wrong in the case of hinamatsuri!!!! 
Because this isn't a slice of life like ""Usagi drop"" where a single father adopts a cute orphan girl. 
This is rather a story of a dumb supernatural girl who forces a person to take care of her. It contains so many eccentric characters, with their weird habits that make you die with laughter. 
Well, I dropped this anime since the jokes were boring and it seemed that the -- minutes of content wasn't worth to just give a small smile like ""Aria the animation"". 
But when I read the manga, I've realized how much of potential was wasted just due to missing of proper ""timings and execution"". 
The art is really weird, it's just not the common facial features you see in other anime and it is more prominent in anime due to colors, hence it takes nearly --- episodes to get adjusted. 
Well, the music is good. The opening is good to hear. But I don't think you need to watch this anime for those when you can't even enjoy. 
I'm not saying this anime is trash, but it's just that, why to watch -- minutes x -- episodes of pointless things just for a few smiles. Yeah tbh, it's a pointless story with no morals, but it was written only for laughing at your heart's content. So instead of missing out the masterpiece, go read the manga and let all your sadness be taken away from you.

Hajime no Ippo: New Chalanger is alot better than S-. All fights had more Substance than any fight in S-. The fight between Date and ricardo was one of the best fights Hajime no Ippo had to offer together with Hawk vs Takamura. 
I love that besides our main character ippo every one gets to shine like Date, Aoki, Kimura, Itagaki and Takamura. 
Character: -/-- 
Like in S- here in S- the characters are all well written. I have lots of fun just watching their fights and their interactions. 
Art: -/-- 
The art is alot better than S-. its more detailed and crisp. Some punches are visually amazing. 
Sound: -/-- 
Also the OP and ED are very good and the ost is remarkably better than S-. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
S- was so much more enjoyable than S-. The fights were alot better, ost was also better. All in all an improvement.

What an incredibly overrated anime this is and also, what an incredible disappointment.  The first episode was great.  The off-the-wall comedy really hit well and I liked the dichotomy between Kobayashi and her isolated and sarcastic nature, when contrasted with Tohru's bombastic personality.  The quirky and quasi-inappropriate nature of the comedy made me think I was gearing up for an anime along the lines of Dai Mahou Togue or My Wife is a Mermaid.  Truly hilarious classics.  Alas, it was not meant to be. 
As soon as the other dragons were introduced, everything started going downhill fast.  The primary problem being Kanna.  Yes, we get it, Kanna is cute and moe and all of that, but she took over the anime and changed it from a quirky and unique dragon comedy into just another ""Raising a child"" comedy.  Way too much focus on her.  And when the other dragons were introduced, they were completely empty as characters and did nothing to change the nature of the anime and balance it out from another boring moe-fest.  And each dragon got more empty and - dimensional as a character as they were introduced.  It basically got so bad that the final dragon's whole gimmick was just being indecisive.  That's it.  Her whole character was based upon not being able to make up her mind.  The others could be described in two words: ""Otaku"" and ""Oppai"".   
Kobayashi and Tohru's seemingly promising relationship from the first episode ends up bogged down in the same flaccid jokes about Otakus and chicks with Big Boobs as any other mediocre ""Slice-of-Life"" anime with those tropes in it, plus buried in a pound of moe.  Very disappointing.  Especially since it seemed like it could be so much more.  It could have even been a great action anime, considering the quality of the very few battle scenes within it.   
Such a disappointment, considering the first episode and those fight scenes meant that with proper direction, this could've been a fantastic twisted action-comedy of some kind.   
Highly overrated and disappointing.

Oh man I will say this here and now, The Less you know about this anime the more you will enjoy it, i will try not to say much but what i love about it is how it makes you think and wonder about the anime itself and yes it is adventure-ish anime but as i said its better to discover it than rather searching stuff about it. 
The Characters: 
They have a unique personality and they are lovable and memorable. 
The Art style: Really Beautiful and rewarding to watch specially the sceneries. 
Overrall: 
It Gets Better every single episode and the soundtrack is really amazing. 
definitely enjoyable its also fun to watch it with friends who hasn't and if so make sure to bring them along the journey and watch it together it makes it even more fun.

Your favorite heavy metal red panda is back! Aggretsuko is here with it's first... I mean second season, wait did I re-watch Aggretsuko season one or am I seeing things. Anywhosies, Aggretsuko is back delivering us -- episodes with none of the pacing and half of the charm!  
I'm not going to waste my time talking about the sound and art, they're the exact same as the old series and of course they meet my every expectation. I couldn't be happier. 
Most of us gleamed at excitement at the glance of the release of Aggretsuko Season Two. Who couldn't enjoy our Retsuko enduring the relatable troubles of being the independent working female adult in modern day Japan, while also battling the burden that is love, soulmates, and marriage. In writing a second season I feel it's agreeable to most people that the second season has to bring something new to the table. Cutting it to the chase, this season does the exact opposite. The narrative is ACTUALLY a carbon copy of the original season of Aggretsuko.  
Let's just make a brief TLDR of both seasons for comparison. In season one Retsuko battles the daily troubles of being a worker in Japan, being forced to work with her sometimes annoying, bratty, and bossy coworkers. She inevitably solves her problems using her friends as a cushion for her conflict. Later in the show she meets a love interest that even though it seems like he's the perfect match, she's really just seeing through fogged up glasses. After Haida sulking drunk in the street, and Retsuko getting a firm talking to by the not-so-bad Ton. Retsuko comes to her senses and realizes this is not the life she wants to lead. Now what's in store for us in season two? Coworker troubles that get resolved with the aid of her friends as a cushion? CHECK. Love interest that is obviously bad for her but Retsuko falls for it because she's blinded by love? CHECK. A really sad Hyena? CHECK. Not-so-bad Ton? CHECK. This season was a literal checklist. I could not be more dissapointed. I'm exaggerating this show isn't a carbon copy, but it does follow the same formula. 
The plot itself was pretty all over the place in terms of quality. At times I felt appreciative on the show's preachment on the issue of marriage presenting different respectable sides from different respectable angles. However, at times I found myself often confused on a characters ability to make a basic easy decisions that could resolve a problem simply without having to drag it on. The writers painted the picture of the relationship as controlling and suffocating, yet Retsuko can't even define that as the reason for ending their relationship, only that her partner won't marry her and start a family with her. I knew Retsuko was clueless, but I didn't know the writers wanted to make her completely moronic to not see this after her eyes were opened to the relationship's problems. On another note can someone please explain to me why there is tid bits of FILLER scattered throughout the series. Ten episodes is not ample time to play a round of fucking golf with the boys. WHO GAVE THESE WRITERS PERMISSION TO MIX AGGRETSUKO WITH ACTUAL FUCKING MUSICAL NUMBERS. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS FANWORKS HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME. 
With that being said this show isn't complete garbage, it does have some decent episodes worth noting, and if you have watched the original I do extremely suggest you check out this season. Be very aware that this show is not as good as you'll expect. If you came for the Haida Retsuko ship you won't find it here. If you came for witty Retsuko tearing it up with her metal ass music, you'll ---% find that here next to the tossed out bottle of anxiety medication that Retsuko decided she didn't need for some reason. 
Aggretsuko Season Two did not unfortunately live up to the hype I gave it after watching the first season. Although I really appreciated the messages spread throughout the show, I was dissapointed I was being spoon fed the exact same formula. Watch with caution kids.

Ah where do I start with this classic. Its great complex story? This amazing feeling of dread you get from some of the darker moments? How insane the characters in this anime truly are? Or should I just ask why isn't Rika my daughter yet(This anime has the most adorable girl ever)? If you are a fan of horror anime then why haven't you watched this yet? I have always loved the whole horror genre so this anime was so amazing to me. Most horror anime just didn't do it for me. I went in to horror anime thinking I was gonna see something like The Ring or The Grudge in anime form. I was disappointed with horror anime for the most part until I finally came across Higurashi. The feeling you get from watching this anime is so dark and perfect. Don't even get me started on the opening. The opening is great, the vocals fit in so perfectly with the visuals giving you a brief glimpse of the dread and insanity you are about to experience. Now if you cant stand gore stay away from this anime. It has some of the most messed up scenes I've ever seen in anime. The characters are memorable. All of them having a very good amount of screen time giving you enough to get attached to. The art is a turn off for some people but I think the art made the anime even better. The faces of the characters in the insane moments have so much feeling in them. You see how insane they are just by looking at their faces. If you like gore, horror, and/or psychological anime give Higurashi a shot.

Title:  ”Money, it's a Shaft.” 
Monogatari is a word which means story. But every story must be about something. The easiest way to characterize plot is just give a title. It’s one of the main factor which describes every story in this universe. 
The first anime adaptation, made by studio Shaft, was called Bakemonogatari (Ghost and Story – Ghostory). Its aim was rather obvious – telling story about ghosts – describe characters by telling story about their ghosts. It’s so easy to understand, isn’t it? Of course because it’s the most safety ground to tell a story about something else. Often this concept touches  characters or relationship between them. If we talk about anime which wants to show one aspect (which is in this case a main one), we have to make a compromise. This compromise is a main plot. But what to do to hide it? Just a think about composition – strategy. 
And here goes the Shaft’s stroke of genius– Blitzkrieg. 
Studio perfectly seen what are their strengths and weaknesses. They knew that presentation the story form very beginning, which Is quite complex, won’t make such a big impression and won’t encourage viewers to see the whole series. There is the reason of Bakemonogatari as the first chapter – characters are the main ground every series. Maybe not characters as they themselves but the formula of their presentation. Viewers remembers only some the most basic things of the show. One of them is type of narrative – characters only talks about anything which strangely perfect fits to situation which is about something what is not important. So something like life, or something. It makes a specific slow pacing, the place is frugal and a bit abstract but perfectly combines with long dialogs, because it’s give a natural to this place. It’s very complex but it’s don’t  require detailed interpretation. So that is that strength of the series, which makes its different to others.  
But what’s the weakness? The rest – plot. 
It’s not hard to figure out that thing. But what to do to turn into the advantage? The solution was adding some pieces of information into the dialogues but in a amount that viewers won’t pay attention to them.  In addition there was no point – separate parts of story were more interesting that the reason why they are. There was just a little problem – the chorological beginning which was only based on the main plot. 
Here Comes Your Man – Shinobu.  
Secret weapon and guarantee of success – If we can’t change it, we can make fans to love it. If the main character of this part is Shinobu, let’s give them impression that she is a very important person, give a lot information round her but not about her (I look at you Snail’s chapter in Second Season).  And Suddenly this character has became as much popular as Senjougahara who had well developed personality, whose development took some parts of the series. But who cares, there is Assassin Shinobu. 
The Main dish – hate born under punches. 
This long introduction was to show the main problem this movie which had came into being long before the first sheets of script have been written. It’s heavily depends on its genesis. I causes the fact that it can’t be taken as a separate anime movie, because basically a long trailer – movie which gives you some parts of information about their localization. But in this case in really poor way. 
So let’s talk about local plot because it’s Monogatari series. Plot focuses more on Koyomi than Shinobu (the poster lies),  what is completely clear because he is the main protagonist of most series. There comes a question – “How to develop any character in any part of this series”. Most people would say that by talking.  And they are right. But there is a problem – you are the only person in the anime, so talking to yourself is kind of sick. So what the authors decided to do? Only logical solution, development by the actions. But the amount of them is a bit low – about - or - scene for - hour movie. It  is rather ridicules, if we know that it’s one on the main topic. By the way if you have even seen at least one movie about vampire, you know these scenes already now.  
By what about Shinobu? And that’s a good question – “What about her?”. She is technically the most important person (like always) but nothing about has been said. To better understand it, you must realize that this part of story is similar to business conversation and making deals. The personality is not important as the product which you want to buy or sell. Every single talk is driven by plot, not character development . And there is nothing wrong with it so far as we don’t talk about characters whose personality are main topics of the movie. 
Here comes the main problem - luck of dialogues. I means that’s not exactly the truth because there are a lot of them . The problem is not their number but their aim. If your show is only based on dialogues and every of them (maybe not -) is about plot whose you will see in another movie, you know that something is wrong. If the plot and character development are main themes, they should have the same weight.  Series shouldn’t begin only one of these elements. The first movie should be a introduction, not a synopsis or a big bag of promises which will come to life when the time will come – trailer. True art defend itself, it doesn’t need trailers. Only business needs them.

Shinsekai yori was something else... 
First let me say Shinsekai yori was not a light watch at all. This is a thinker's anime. Casual viewers will probably be very turned off by the serious nature of the show. Having said that, for those of you who are looking for an anime that shows the story of a dark, fear ridden society in a brutally honest way keep on reading! 
Shinsekai yori is unique in which it has no correct set of morals. The line between good vs bad is blurred to the point where the viewer sympathizes with the antagonist. 
Why is this? 
It is because Shinsekai Yori is very realistic.  
Let me give an example to further the meaning of the previous statement: In modern society many consider stealing to be a sin while others justify the act in order to feed their families. 
In other words survival is all that matters and that is what Shinsekai yori is, a situation in which survival is the only thing that justifies an action or not. 
Now logic such as this will undoubtedly result in very disturbing outcomes and decisions so viewers should brace themselves for very gruesome events. 
If anyone is expecting to see plenty of action/comedy/happiness I suggest you think twice about trying this anime. Positive moments are stretched out far in between and thus rare throughout while tragedy is almost always present. Also casual watchers should beware that Shinsekai yori requires some degree of analysis for it to be enjoyed to its utmost potential. 
If you are still with me, Great! Here goes the review. Everything is spoiler free! 
Story: -.- 
The setting involves a dystopian society ---- years into the future that has actually reversed progress regarding industry and technology due to human beings obtaining telekinesis. We observe the society of year ---- through the eyes of - children who are just as clueless as the viewer. The story is narrated by one of the children, Saki, as the anime shows the events of the children's lives and their fates from the ages -----. Throughout the anime the group of five learn of the evils and secrets that society has hidden away. Upon learning, life changing events take place throughout their lives, affecting not only their relationships but their sanity as well. 
The story of Shinsekai yori takes the concept of a dystopian future but applies it in its own very original style. It explores various sinister and dark themes of the human mind through solving the thrilling mysteries of the society and its past. 
The story was highly original and refreshing due to its thought provoking and mature layout. Taking a story such as this and adding the amount of realism Shinsekai yori provides results in a story that is close to flawless. 
Art: -.- 
Now I must admit, the art would amaze me one episode and then would make me cringe the next. For example there were many instances where some of the character's faces and bodies were so warped it shocked me that such mistakes were made in production. Although having said that, there were various instances where the art was absolutely stunning. Gorgeous still shots and surreal dream sequences beautifully portray the gloomy environment.  
Just try searching up Shinsekai yori and looking up some HD scene pics. 
I give the art a -.- because the production team really made some episodes look absolutely horrible while others were done brilliantly. 
To sum it up the art is inconsistent and is a hit or miss depending on the episode. 
Sound: - 
Shinsekai yori did not have an OP, which may bother some. I skip the OP --% of the time so the fact that Shinsekai yori had no OP was not a negative factor personally. 
The soundtrack was spot on in providing the gloomy dark atmosphere for the anime. It really stood out. Each time a track played it would send shivers down my spine as I watched in awe as to what was happening on screen. 
For the episodes where the art was done well, once the music played, it would produce some of the most chilling scenes of any horror anime I've ever seen.  
One thing that should be noted about the music is that it is very repetitive and is rarely varied. Although in Shinsekai yori's case this isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
Why change something that does its job ---%? 
Character: -.- 
Now I have to admit that the characters are decent at best. I doubt that even Shinsekai yori lovers and fan boys would put one of the characters in their favorites. Although they are not very memorable the reason I gave it a -.- was because their actions and reactions were very realistic (something the whole anime has going for it). From tough decisions to shocking news, all the characters reacted in ways that the viewer could relate to.  
Other than the realism most viewers will likely not be very attached to the characters which will thus reduce the emotion induced upon tragic events. 
Nonetheless, I still give it a solid -.-. 
Overall: - 
Boasting a plot and environment that could have potentially catapulted it into my group of masterpieces Shinsekai yori falls short due to suffering to a tedious build up with some unmemorable characters and inconsistencies in art. 
Overall I highly enjoyed Shinsekai yori and its wonderfully refreshing story and believe that any anime fan that truly loves mystery, horror, and plot twists must give Shinsekai yori a try.

Alright. This ova is a bit different than other ovas. 
Story - - 
There isn't really any story in this, it's just some scenarios put in to show ecchi. But, this is exactly what the developers are going for, so it works out fine. The first involves Tamamo and Shirasaki in a drawing scene, the second shows Kana and Senri at the beach, and the -rd has Kodachi and Sayumi (the blue haired hacker/restaurant worker) at the restaurant and then the bath. Each episode contains very revealing photos of the girls and has the girls talking to each other as well. 
Art - - 
The art consists of photos mainly. There isn't much animation at all, but since the anime was going for this, you can't really give them a low score. 
Sound - - 
The sound isn't anything different from the main story. 
Character - - 
The characters are all pretty much the same, just thrown into ecchi situations. 
Enjoyment - - 
I didn't really enjoy it all that much, because I personally like full-animation and story. (most ovas are fine), but the small amount of story they added was enough to keep me watching. Other people might find the enjoyment to be less or more, depending on who they are though. 
Overall - - 
These episodes are mainly focused on the people who love ecchi, and the people who will watch anything ""Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai (A Good Librarian, Like a Good Shepherd)"" related. But if you have time to kill, you misewell watch it.

(If you're -- and haven't experienced JoJo, skip to the safe space for my 'spoiler free' interview) 
---- 
""Let the joy of love give you cancer""-Araki 
There's a reason why DiU sits near the top of almost any JoJo fans ranking. 
Because its an absolutely and positively inspired piece of work. 
Let's get the obvious criticism out of the way first. While the voice acting is grade A, this show puts the ugh in ugly, (I.E Quality Queen). But some episodes (I.E Bug Eaten) are stellar looking, with strong color pallets and character design. It's just quite obvious the budget from part - isn't there, which, while a shame, isn't deal breaking. At this point the Duwang scans have made me feel like Oliver Twist, I just want some more you know? I'll take what I can get from David Productions, as long as they deliver my beloved part -, from Tony to Rock Paper Scissors to Ambulance, we're cool. 
Which is what they did.  
A common criticism leveled at part - is it's lack of focus. It doesn't start the ""plot"" and introduce the main villain until a third of the way through; but can you blame Araki for not knowing (at first) how to follow up a planned trilogy with a clear conclusion? While its unfortunate the first section of DiU isn't so smoothly connected to the rest of itself (Josuke time traveling, Araki how did you forget that), it is an undeniable fact that when Araki is provided breathing room to experiment, he gives his best work (See SBR).  
Stands positively SHINE in part -; gone are the ""monster of the week"" stands of part -, which are replaced by a variety of stands that complement their given user. Echoes evolves alongside the growing Koichi, Heavens Door fits a mangaka such as Rohan like a glove, and The Hands overwhelming power is balanced only by the sheer stupidity of Okuyasu. Some stands have zero combat potential whatsoever (Cinderella, Pearl Jam) and exist solely to further the atmosphere of Morioh. While punch ghosts are fun, and Jotaro gets plenty of strong screen time, it's Araki's unbounded creativity that makes DiU so fun and unforgettable. 
I'd be lying if I said the lack of Josephs mannerisms and catchphrases doesn't leave a bit of a hole in my funny bone. However, Araki does manage to preserve the magical humor of previous parts in DiU. If anything, JoJo has never been funnier. Jotaro's straight faced autism remains strangely both bad-ass and comedic, and Josuke's new personality mixes well with characters like Rohan and Okuyasu to create those bizarre situations we love. Then there's stands such as Stray Cat, Boy - Man, Earth Wind and Fire, and of course, Cheap Trick. Cheap Trick will leave you in a pool of piss on your hospital bed that you can't clean up because you're restrained and sedated. It's unfortunate that part - and - didn't take some notes.  
If someone asked how Araki could possibly follow up DIO, then I imagine Kira as the proverbial slap in the face as his response. Whether or not you think he deserves a quiet life, the sheer presence Kira exerts on the show from the get-go is undeniable. Kira has personality, wit, motivation, luck (are those sirens?) and mother-fucking Killer Queen. A serial killer is a logical conclusion to the question of a villain in a setting such as small town Morioh, and Kira is as competent as his real life look alike. (R.I.P David Bowie) 
JoJo op's are legendary, and for good reason. They're love letters; with hand-crafted songs tailored to fit certain parts of the story, bundled with little references for veterans to the series. As songs, CNBT and Chase are worthy successors, but as opening videos, they fall just short of Stand Proud or Sono Chi no Sodome. Still good op's, but the budget just doesn't seem to warrant a video I could call gre... 
Then there's Great Days. 
I've never seen or heard an opening embody a series so perfectly. And the rewind version features absolutely genius cuts and sound effects, making the DiO version of End of the World look like a linkin park amv. 
And ""---- Bizarre Summer""? Holy shit that's a lyric?  
I got a boner. 
The only proof anyone should need to understand that David P is the studio worthy to adapt JoJo to the end, is Morioh Radio. It's a foreign element to the manga, but who would know? That high energy radio jingle only seeks to heighten the atmosphere of bizarre Morioh; and it speak volumes about the love and dedication the series is being shown by its creators. 
Sasuga David.  
(Kiddie friendly zone) 
Me: How's the show, Josuke? 
J: Great.

A beautiful show. The characters all feel real, and everything's plotted out so well. The animation, for the most part, is fantastic (crowd shots look a little derpy though). This series is just so satisfying, especially with how simple the premise is. It's incredibly relatable, and it makes you really want these kids' romance to end well. 
Not only are the two main characters three-dimensional, but the series takes the time for you to get to know all the secondary and tertiary characters as well. Some are more fleshed out than others, obviously, but you never feel as if there are any loose ends that need to be tied up. This is something that's sorely missing in a lot of other shows (not just anime). 
This is a show I'll definitely be rewatching for years.

Although Einstein’s theory of general relativity allows for backwards time-travel to exist — at least, theoretically speaking — modern day physicists have yet to conceive a device that would enable humans to manipulate the flow of time.  That being said, science fiction author’s, as well as ordinary people, will continue to dream about the notion of time travel, and the boundless opportunities, as well as ramifications, it would likely entail.  Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo (The Girl Who Leapt Through Time) is a story that takes a simple approach to the concept of time-travel, following the events of a high school girl who, unexpectedly, attains the ability to leap backwards through time and change the outcome of certain events.  Initially, her intentions are quite inconsequential, like getting a flawless score on her pop quiz, or avoiding getting knocked over by some rowdy boys.  Then, predictably, Makoto (the female protagonist) realizes the inadvertent consequences of her actions, leading her to the conclusion that time should not  be altered for the whims of one person.  The banal outcome of the main character’s journey notwithstanding, there was one character that spoiled the entire movie with his cryptic motivations and inexplicable actions thereafter.  I speak, of course, of Chiaki Mamiya. 
Chiaki Mamiya is a high school boy who is friends with Makoto and Kousuke.  His inclination to take school lightly and spend the majority of his time playing baseball matches up well with Makoto’s interests, preluding us to the eventual declaration that initiates the final cascade of events.  This reveal catalyzes Makoto’s character forward into discovering new emotions about herself, while, at the same time, sacrifice’s vital information that was necessary in telling a complete story.  To expand upon this idea, I will need to divulge a handful of SPOILERS. 
After Chiaki asks Makoto out on a date, Makoto begins to see her friendship quite differently.  Going so far as to avoid the question through her time leap and pretend it never happened.  But it did happen.  At least, from Makoto’s perspective.  The numerous awkward encounters that proceed culminate into a situation in which Makoto continues to obviate Chiaki’s efforts, leading to a situation in which Chiaki catches Makoto by surprise, questioning whether she knows about the time leap.  This is where the relatively bland, mundane movie begins to unravel.  Chiaki reveals that he is from the future, and has traveled back through time to see a…painting.  Of course, you would think we would be privy to the significance this painting holds to Chiaki, but, alas, we are not.  It is, after all, the primary reason — the only reason — this character decides to alter an entire timeline of events and, most likely, change the trajectory of future events thereafter.  Then, matters are exacerbated further when Chiaki announces he must return his home (the future) through the use of his time leap.  Implying, invariably, that the time leap can be used to travel forward through time, as well.  Why, then, did Makoto, through her numerous time leaps, never travel forwards through time, even by some accident?  It was clear from the outset that she never truly understood the mechanics of the time leap, as she would often times overshoot her desired time location.  Wouldn’t it be entirely plausible for her to accidentally travel forward through time, creating new dilemma’s that must be dealt with.  Furthermore, the enigmatic ending that leaves a realm of possibilities for the viewer to ponder, only imbues further dissatisfaction.  Because now we must consider what Chiaki means by these words: “I’ll be waiting for you.”  Notice that Chiaki does not kiss Makoto in this moment, but, instead, hugs her.  Perhaps indicating that Chiaki is, in fact, her future son?  Due to the dearth of character depth, it is challenging for us to pull anything away from this encounter.  Sure, we can speculate, as several others have done.  But what can we hope to learn when there were no attempts at fleshing out the authentic nature of these characters.  Everything is presented as surface level fluff, evading the core principles that govern the character’s actions.  Because of this, I can only conclude that Makoto feels attracted to Chiaki because of jealousy — remember, she only starts to like him after she time leaps and sees him with another girl.  And Chiaki only likes Makoto because they play baseball together.  What else is there to go on? 
Overall, the movie did not live up to the praise everyone showers upon it.  The animation, while intentionally simple, was uninspiring, leaving little to no impression.  A rare miss for Madhouse studios.  The music was decent, but is easily forgettable.  The cast, like I explained ad nauseam, were surface level characters, lacking essential depth to give the viewer a bridge to create a bond of empathy.  Which is a shame, because when the story is devoid of interesting, well thought out plot points; and the character’s motivations/emotions are scarce, to say the least, then it really leaves nothing else for the anime to effectively stand on with firm footing.

俺の妹はこんなに可愛いわけがない(Ore no Imouto ha Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, you know the translation) is one of the recently popular anime with absurdingly long name, which to sum up the story the anime's name should have been changed to 俺の妹は絶対可愛くない(Ore no Imouto ha Zettai Kawaikunai, My Little Sister is No Way in Hell Cute) as after watching the entire anime(with the OVAs), I still never experienced a single second of Kirino being 'cute', I am indeed a fan of tsundere charas to an extent, but Kirino's bitchyness is too severe to be put off 
Though with all that hate towards Kirino, I think she is a well-made character, as she is very unique and stand out(you don't see little sisters bitching on her brother very often in anime do you?), she's not the whiny ""oniichan, oniichan"" kind of sister you usually get. The best part of her is the actual annoyance she create, I seldomly know any heroine which specificly 'exist to annoy you' like Kirino. Most writers would want their heroine to be lovable and attractive to the audiences, but the author of OreImo decided to do the opposite, and it worked pretty nicely, though you still would want her to be alittle nicer and at least thank her brother properly for literally saving her existence 
As for Kyousuke, I find his character highly unrealistic, he might look like the best existence you can ever have for a brother, but that is where it is illogical. Kyousuke had stated countless times that he hates Kirino, right from the beginning to the end, but he will go to extreme measures for her(SPOILER ALERT, skip the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to read spoilers) threatening to beat up his own father(which in turn could end up in him being beaten up himself and thrown out of the house for a week). Throwing away all his pride to beg to the animator team for Kirino's masturbation novel that he didn't even enjoy himself(which his and Kuroneko's rude attitudes towards them could've backfire them in the first place, normally if you talk like that to someone you want to please, chances are they won't be pleased and might even cancel out the anime project for it). Shaming himself countless times(acting like a total pervert for Ayase to make up for her friendship with Kirino, buying eroge in front of a huge crowd, seen by his own best friend and some other townspeople who show outright disgust to him), etc and YET he is willing to continue being Kirino's slave when he fully have the right to kick Kirino for his own frustration. 
For the other supporting/minor characters, many are too bland, illogical, or simply not appealing enough. Ayase, Kuroneko and Saori became close to Kyousuke for no particular reason(well there is a reason and it is: he needs a harem). Manami is the only girl who is reasonable enough to be romanticly involved with Kyousuke and yet the story would intentionally kill her charm by calling her mundane by itself, which would have raised her appeal if the story have just left those sentences out(well they have to tone her down so the harem could happen, otherwise she would officially be Kyousuke's legal wife and no other girl could be paired with him), and another character featured in the OVA, Akagi Sena, Kyousuke's friend's little sister, had showed severe obsession on yaoi, to the extent that it impaired her logic and moral to be stupid enough to present an idea on a yaoi game in a room full of straight guys, not noticing that it could as well get her kicked or expelled from the club, if not school. 
In conclusion this series is decent if you want to watch something while turning your brain off, ignoring all the illogical points and enjoying the nonsense of a seemingly masochistic brother being beaten by his sadistic little sister, but well if you don't like anime that annoy you, whether or not you like tsunderes or not, you should stay away from this anime just to keep your nerves intact.

What can I say about this anime.... well really, plot just  devolved horribly after the first part. I have always enjoyed the Ghost in the Shell series.. The original movie, the two Stand alone complex animes, and of course, Arise, but this movie is one MAJOR exception. One thing I had to realize with the GitS franchise, was that I wanted everything to be understandable, logical, and explainable. However, at certain points the plot there is just a tendency for it to ""pull things outta its ***"" and cleverly disguise it as being SO WELL thought out, that most people cant completely follow it. This Movie takes THAT aspect of the series, and makes a movie out of it..... yeah, so it gets really tripy about halfway into the movie, and you just go along for the ride, and HOPE things get explained, but really it just falls into the realm of ""well this is philosophically abstract..that there is really no point in exploring it.....but alas they try anyway"". Essentially, by the end of the anime, there are just these strong vibes given off how, every other character is weaker, both physically and mentally to Bato, who seems just to be overly and unequally badass for no real reason.. and makes everyone else to be just look horribly pathetic. I seriously cant help feel that there is some weird reason behind this, like that the creator is championing Bato as an extension of himself and going on a power trip with him in the movie. All in all, the movie is just so abstract, that you cant really take away anything from it other than,...""ow my head"" and knowing that it hurts not because I'm not getting something... but that there was nothing to get about it in the first place.

Before actually deciding to watch this show called “Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku”, I have to ask a question: do you really watch a show for enjoyment or do you watch a show to get the most out of it? When I sat down and decided to give this series a try, it felt like an anime that I would not have high expectations on. The premise, character visuals, and just overall idea of it sounds like a copy-paste story you can find in almost any light novel medium these days. But for Death March, this proved to be one of the blandest anime I’ve seen in recent years even compared to similar premises. It’s a literal slap to the face to anyone who expect this to be better than what it looks like. 
Just for reference, I have read the light novel and keeping it up with took a lot of commitment. I’m actually close to dropping the LN series but this adaptation is on another level of trash. Taking place in a fantasy setting with RPG gimmicks, we got main protagonist Ichiro Suzuki (also known as “Satou” in the other world). His life changes one day after getting hit into an accident and wakes up in this unknown world. Sound familiar? I swear, you can literally pick up any light novel these days with a similar premise and the set up would be something similar. In the meantime, we follow Satou’s adventure as he begins to adapt with his new life. 
I’m just going to throw it out here. This show is extremely blend in terms of storytelling. My initial impression of the first few episodes were pretty much me struggling to stay awake. Not only is Satou an uninteresting protagonist but the story itself is devoid of emotions. It’s actually a bit ironic since a show like this should have colorful world fiction to make the setting feel alive. What do we get instead? A group of one dimensional characters in a blend world that felt like it’s part of a video game.  Or I should say, a broken video game. A polished game would have memorable characters but you’ll find none of that in this series. Main protagonist Satou is not only just overpowered but also exhibits some disturbing personality if you read between the lines. The way he speaks, behaves, and interacts with certain characters is never engaging to watch. It doesn’t help that his personality is dry to the bone and seemingly always acts the same with his harem. Oh, I did just say that word. Some people may not call this a harem but to me, this series is about as harem-esque as it can get. Consisting of mainly female characters, it doesn’t take long for viewers to find out that they are fond of Satou. Arisa, Pochi, Tama, Zena, Nana. There’s pretty much no character development for any of the main cast. Instead, most of them are there to interact with Satou in order to put him over. The only way to say there’s any development is Satou’s progress as a character as he acquires more skills. Bleh. 
That being said, I guess there’s some hope for the main story? The series does take place in a fantasy world and that can have potential, right? Wrong. The world building in the series is incredibly underwhelming as most places look bare and feel almost identical. If you’ve seen one place, it feels like you’ve seen them all. Bear in mind that as the series progresses, the world of Death March never evolves just like the weak character cast. The story feels more like a slice of life with occasional fighting and drama thrown in. My main issue in the story is just how meekly it’s written. Story segments feel anticlimactic and lacks substance. It doesn’t connect with the characters and never makes an impact. Pacing issues also puts this show to shame from the start as it never manages to salvage itself. Also, keep in mind that the light novel series has hundreds of chapters and this is a ---episode anime adaptation. Yes, you can guess it. This anime pretty much throws the big fat sign of “buy the light novel!” My advice is don’t. That money could be put into so much more value and it’s a waste to spend it on this. Nonetheless, Death March loves to showcase Satou like he’s some of saint in the show. And that gives me nothing more than a thumb down. 
Silver Link adapts this anime and it’s sad to say but they dropped the ball. What could have been a beautiful world setting turned into mediocre junk. I’ll be honest here. It’s terrible. The CG is awkward along with the blend character designs. Even the main female protagonists all look like cheap cartoons made by amateurs. Most of them have the same face but with different color hair and body proportions. The fan service has incredibly cringe timings that I can’t help but laugh in the wrong way. Action in the series is also poorly animated in terms of choreography and key animation. The body movements feels flat and it seems to me that this anime project was not taken seriously from the beginning. 
I’m not usually one to jump on a character for their voice but my goodness, Satou’s voice genuinely makes me wish they found a better VA. His voice sounds like it’s putting us to sleep and lacks any personality. Even when he shows emotions, it feels incredibly forced with cheesy dialogue delivery. There’s not one line in this show that I find memorable and that’s because of his voice mannerisms. Sometimes, I wish there’s a volume lower than mute. The theme songs aren’t much better as it’s incredibly generic made with lazy lyrics. 
Watching Death March was a challenge for me. What could have been a chance to showcase a watchable fantasy series turned into an abomination. By the time I finished watching this show, I felt a sigh of relief that the series ended up only receiving -- episodes.  It should have just been left alone as a light novel instead. The adaptation has a dysfunctional story, uncharismatic character cast, and really gives isekai a bad name. In fact, I’d say Death March almost made a show like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni look good.

Warning: This anime will trigger you. 
Damn I'm funny 
I am doing a full pledged review of this thing. No jokes, no bullshit, pure dull and uninteresting opinions. Well maybe two jokes. 
You might like this anime if: 
-Uuuuuuh 
You might dislike this anime if: 
-You don't like -- second long animations. 
Story: - 
Without spoiling a thirty second long animation, because review guidelines don't allow that and I will get banned, the story doesn't exist. Moving on. 
Art and Animation: - 
It looks nice, character designs are pretty cool and the animation is fluid. Looks kinda silly overall though. 
Sound: -- 
There is one song, but hell it's catchy. I actually can't get that beat out of my head. No joke. 
Character: - 
So there are three characters, which I can assume are girls, but I don't want to be disrespectful so I won't state that. You have Trigger, Muzzle and Spring. Trigger, which I think is the mascot of the studio now, shoots one or two pistols. I can't distinguish it to be honest. Muzzle shoots some sort of a gun. Spring uses knives. They do look cool and I probably would watch an anime with these three being the main cast. Unfortunately, there is close to no development for these amazing characters and that led me to score them this low. At least it has better character development than Tokyo Ghoul. 
Come at me. 
PS: Trigger is literally a rip off of Tracer. Shame on you Trigger. The studio, not the character. You can't make an animated character ashamed. Yeah. 
Enjoyment: - 
I rewatched it like -- times. It does look cool and the song is catchy as all hell. I did that mostly for the song though. My favourite part is the first second, when the beat just starts and you see that top part of Trigger's hair. It's pretty sweet. 
Overall: - 
I took my precious time to write this for no reason at all. Whatever. You should probably watch it. I watched it on some weird russian site called Rutube, that has these weird, kinda creepy -D animations. I am kinda scared now to be honest. Also just to clear things up, if I see all of these ten outta ten reviews become as prominent as Kimi no Na wa reviews, I will end myself. It's up to you internet. It's up to you and your silly memes. 
In the end, that's just my opinion and I encourage you to develop your own. 
PS: If you draw hentai, send me drawings of these characters. I may or may not pay you. 
PS: I will not pay you.

“Adjoining space” 
Come and step inside to a place where full of ridiculous adventures yet to be unfolded unto its end. Begin to discover a world where there’s a variety of monologues to be heard that has an uncertain point. Last but not the least, experience a non thrilling ride where usually some of its scenes is just being annoying. Upon watching it you may feel that it has some intriguing and exciting storyline to expect, but it turns out to be a dull story that doesn’t have any unique or amazing element to be amazed on. It has a story that is composed with such absurdity which most of them brings a lot of headache to become seriously understandable. Also, as the monologues don’t suit on the situation either on the story, this becomes an exchange of bland thoughts that gives either fluster or total denial on continuing this series.  
With its failure due to its story, there might be a couple or few to be entertained on. One, it contains a fighting scenes that is quite interesting due that it composed of characters that have different abilities and artwork to polish each of its scenes, yet it might be as common for the others to say as it doesn’t stands out to be different or unique. Second, with the help of the music and background sounds it emphasizes the movement and flow of each scene, characters, and effects throughout the show. Lastly, it’s the only thing that this series greatly posses which brings different emotions, CHARACTERS! which is some of them are common, funny, silly, and a source of fan service (just being sarcastic on these, but it’s quite true) that might be the asset of this show.  
Speaking of the characters, my first impression is… speechless. Cannot describe with just words but can conclude that it is a bunch of lame, stereotype, and somehow non-entertaining due to its foolish actions. I’ll say that the other side (enemies) is much better than most of the leading/non-leading characters, but sadly to say, the series just contains a little amount of episodes that will focus more to the abilities of the enemies or maybe to improve the character development. On its way be glad to see some of the leading/non-leading character that puts effort on giving just a little up to big amount of excitement and thrill. Overall, it’s not good neither bad but don’t expect to see some amazingly different from the characters as they move throughout the series. 
Obviously I can’t understand on what elements they’re trying to focus on this series. It seems that because it contains few episodes they convey on and didn’t manage to emphasize the story itself but rather they add some random scenes just to fill it out, However, these kind of scenes didn’t manage to give anything significant to the show rather it’s full of idiocy that brings disappointment as an overall.  I don’t think it’s recommendable with all of its ‘amazing crap’ aspects. If you are curious about it, just try it out and enter the world of foolishness. As soon as you ‘finish’ the -- episodes you may consider yourself lucky to be out to that world. As for me I’m just curious on how the ending went but sadly to say it’s still the same as where I started.

This anime is sincerely a gem that needs more attention. I found some old notes I took on this amazing work and decided on a whim just now that I should take the time to compile them so that maybe someone new may witness its grandeur. 
The first thing that caught my attention was the artwork. It was more cartoon-like, so I was uncertain how serious I should take the show. But slowly I witnessed how sinister the world truly was. After a while I began to notice all the subtleties and supporting elements the artwork helped establish, and I quickly grew fond of it there onwards. As for the plot at the beginning, it had me hooked with the the way it conveyed thought provoking questions to the audience - it always left me wondering about something after watching an episode. On another note, the main character was quiet and complacent most of the time. This allowed the environment and people around him develop the story instead, engrossing the audience further into the world. In a span of one mere episode, many morals were put into question, including not only the relationships between family and friends but the relationship between one's own mind and body as well. 
As for the story goes, it was capable of delivering moral ambiguities and mixed emotions with an apathetically melodramatic tone, if that makes sense. The atmosphere was very calm and lull like, but at the same time the audience was sometimes forced to witness something morally outrageous. This seems hard to do, but Kaiba successfully pulled it off. There is this dissonance created between how sinister and selfish the world is and how the world is portrayed to the audience. 
The story repetitively showed how dark the world was, but it also showed glimpses of love and compassion throughout the series. Yes humans are selfish, depraved, and weak-willed, but they also have the potential to become selfless, compassionate, and courageous. I enjoyed how there was always a glimmer of hope no matter how inauspicious the story developed. 
I can't forget to talk about how unorthodox the plot is delivered. Like what we've seen in Baccano and the famous western flick, Pulp-fiction, the story is not told in a chronological order. Instead, it throws you into a world you have no connection with and forces you to observe and come to your own conclusions about what is going on. Seriously, you will have no idea what's going on at first, but that is fine because neither does the main character. As the story progresses everything starts to make sense. Although, once you get a real understanding of the plot it begins to jump back and forth between events and memories, giving more depth to the characters and answering many questions, but still leaving more to be answered until the final moment where all the pieces finally come together and everything becomes clear. 
With all this in mind, this anime obviously isn't for everyone. But if you are looking for a wild ride where you need to be sitting in your thinking chair and wearing your thinking cap to not fall off, Kaiba is most definitely worth checking out.

Basically, it's a -D Less-Anime-More-BS with an empty story, moe characters, made in photos and good music. Would you watch it? 
No spoiler no life, it would be too vague so: 
SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER: 
Story: Lots of nonsense, some witch who predicts the future and kills people. Everything starts from the title ""Reversed World"" aka ""Paralel World"", but it turns out it's the same world? 
Now we can easily understand the cliche and common this concept of this story,  following a MC more dull and careless than my sliced cheese. Problems are showing themselves from the first frame, in which someone from the original world gets killed for knowing[nothing], everyone cherring a man's death. Hooray, economy.. 
So, until the end of the series, we are understanding that there are two worlds who coexist in the same time and space, who can so easily interact with each other without penalty, but still everyone know of it and are still all confused. Why's that? If you don't know how to have content and fluidity in it, YOUR STORY IS OVER. How can you just never clear things up and keep adding mysteries one over another? Bet the writer doesn't have a clue either. 
Sound: 
Music is good, as for the footsteps or any other effects choose to use something too common and small for something of a way bigger scale or different sound. 
Art: 
Yeah, -D as it is but the character's movements weren't fluid at all, they moved too slow and you could tell the missing frames.  
Backgrounds looked very well and deserve some credit, characters looked good too with the positions being a little more realistic than expected. 
Characters: 
They we're cute. Yet couldn't take the opportunities and be a little clever or deductive. Also, the MC in the OP looked like Arararagi. This anime doesn't have originality at all, just balls. Eh, the least I can say is that the characters are, somehow, honest. 
Enjoyment: 
Music was really good, art didn't look bad at all and characters we're honest, with a somewhat interesting and empty story, but I can't ask much for a total of -- minutes in a show, can I? 
But still enjoyed it a lot. Just because it had that charm of hard-working people, but I only had expectations, because it could have been so much better.

A show with a protagonist so powerful that nothing can stand in his path, sounds like an interesting concept? Think of it, a guy whose guild of --+ members worked hard to create the best castle and obtain ultimate items, finds himself trapped in virtual world with all the skills and items he possessed. He's also magician class, thrown into some generic fantasy land full of mediocre and weak creatures. He has also got numerous extremely powerful servants, so does such starting point of an anime or any RPG sound interesting? What is the point of playing a game where you already have dominance? 
I've mentioned some parts of the story in former paragraph, the story is blunt - a guy is trapped in RPG world and tries to protect his place from any possible invaders. He's also scouting around, but that's what I've got from story so far, I've read some reviews and noticed there isn't much of a plot at all. 
Art and sound are mediocre, though I'd say some character designs don't look appealing at all, especially the protagonist whose design looks pretty bad (why creating such giant cloak, also those two red balls on shoulders which look horrible?). 
The show falls horribly at characters. The protagonist is typical guy in harem shows, making stupid reactions when a female makes a move to him, for example: *gulp* I...I touched her *loses breath*.  He repeats this every time, and no matter that most of those scenes are supposed to look like jokes, they are just blunt and annoying. Let's move to the servants, they are typical AI, no personality, just responding to the player. They are just talking about the protagonist and how much they love him, though there was a feud between Albedo and Shalltear who will marry the protagonist and give a birth to the heir... which is just.... I almost puked when I watched that scene. Especially since they are undead, so why would he need a heir?? It was just pathetic scene, especially the art and sound were horrible when a character would become obsessed about the protagonist. What about others? I haven't watched much, but I'd say they have barely any role in the show, to let us see the capabilities of protagonist and his servants. They are typically good guys or bad guys, nothing more or less. 
Now about enjoyment... There wasn't any. All these elements combines heave a pathetic image of a horrible show with no interesting scenes and characters or good points. The whole show is that some bad guys try to do bad stuff to good guys, the protagonist gets involved, the whole drama starts and it's built slowly, the bad guys spend a lot of time summoning their champion which gets destroyed in a blink of an eye. Is the purpose of the show to make us see how ridiculous power of the protagonist is? To see how the servants can be robots who do nothing but obey their master?  
Overall: the show is annoying, contains only one generic character while others are just some beings who react to the protagonist and have nothing of their own, jokes are overused and blunt, action is boring and done in matter of seconds... Makes me wonder why do people adore this show.  
I lasted only - episodes, I don't know will I ever get enough strength and nerves to watch more to provide more details because this show is just pathetic.  
If you think of watching the show, I kindly suggest you to skip this rubbish.

Story : - 
The story for the second season follows very closely the first there is no time gap but things change greatly from one season to the other. The first season was funnier and more focused into exploring the funny aspects of the characters and school but the second focuses more on the struggle of the characters both personal and academic. It focuses more on how the characters overcome their issues and struggles especially in regards to family matters, dreams and aspirations as well as deep psychological issues brought by a sense of destiny and obligation. Keep in mind that this does not mean that the series is no longer funny and enjoyable but that it just focuses more on 'actual' issues. 
Art: - 
The art is pretty much what you have come to expect from the first season. There are no visible differences. It is still pretty good. Perhaps the most notable change are facial expressions due to the larger variety of emotions felt by the main and supporting characters. 
Sound: - 
Exactly like the first season the music seems to be irrelevant. Once again the ost does not complement the actual story despite the story line being more profound in the second season. 
Character: - 
The characters continue their journey through life and in several cases they become more relatable. The character development has indeed escalated but due to this the series lost some of its funnier aspects. This is by no mean a bad thing. 
Enjoyment : - 
Despite the changes this season is very enjoyable mainly because it shows us different aspects of the characters. Yes it may not be as funny as the first but the fact is that the creators dared to show us a more realistic perspective of the characters lives, something that I personally found quite enjoyable. 
Overall : - 
Overall the series is very good and it is my belief that the change of pace and direction in season - complements season - greatly. I would prefer if there was a season - in order to see how the story unfolded after the end of season - but in order to explain it better I would have to add spoilers which is never a good thing. 
In conclusion I highly recommend it.

The good: You don't need to watch the first season to follow the story.  
The bad: The anime started with a score of -.-- and ended with a -.--.  If you watched the first season, you would feel a bit disappointed. Unlike the first season, this anime doesn't entertain because the story is weird and the pacing is average. For me, this anime is just an alternative story from the main series.  
Danmachi Sword Oratoria centers the story in Aiz Wallenstein, the sword princess. Sadly, even if Aiz is the main character, there isn't too much information about her past just some sporadic scenes and the plot centers on her desire of getting stronger. During her adventure into the dungeons, she fought with a person that could know more about her past, and she decides to go into the lower dungeon levels to find the truth. The plot has pacing problems and lacks more information to keep us entertained.  
While this anime follows the main idea of the Danmachi series, I feel that something is missing. Perhaps some characters aren't well developed and annoying to the point that we could get bored of them. The introduction of some characters is forced or useless, and there isn't enough time to develop their personalities fluently. Maybe the novel is different.   
The art is standard. Honestly, I was expecting to be better than the first season, but I can say, it is the same.  
About the songs, the OP is nice, and the ED is passable. The sound mix is good and focuses on the fights details.  
Finally, nothing is concluded, and nothing about Aiz is told, so in other words, the story failed to deliver any reasonable conclusion, it ends abruptly. It was just a promotion for the novel, buy it to find the truth. 
Maybe you will enjoy it more if you haven't watched the first season. If you are a fan of the first season, do not expect too much from this or you will get upset, it is just a spin-off.

IT'S NOT ABOUT SWIMMING! despite what one would glean from the title and picture. What it is about is a tale of love, familial obligation and being bound by the past. The characters are interesting and diverse and the story is intriguing. It' hard to praise this anime without giving too much away, but the animation is smooth and fluid, but that's to be expected from an anime not dependent on action scenes. But it's a touching love story that's both tragic and seems genuine. If this is your sort of genre (it's not mine though I finished it) I recommend watching it. HOWEVER, there are a few things that robbed it of it's five. First the fan service on characters so young, will repulse some instantly, though it's few and far between, nevertheless it's there. There's also a cultural gap here where the sins of the father are held against the sins of the son; which makes watching the plot play out laughable. As an American some the behaviors and actions of certain characters are ridiculous. Which brings me to the last issue, ""Where is Bright Noah when we need him?"" A few “corrections” would have solved every issue in this series. I don't want to give too much away but needless to say several correction punches could've shortened this series, by half if not more. Not too much to complain about other than that so watch it is my vote!

IGN chose Shirobako as one of the Top Anime of the Year ----. After seeing their list, I decided to give this anime a try and I can personally say that this is one of -- if not -- the most underrated/underhyped anime of all time.  
(There will be SPOILERS in my review) 
[Story]: (-.-/--) (SPOILERS)  
Aoi Miyamori is part of the high school Animation club along with her - friends Midori, Shizuka, Misa and Ema. They all have a dream: to one day work at the same animation company and make an anime of their own. Two years later, Aoi graduated and she now works as a production assistant at the Musashino Animation. Despite the tough job, long hours and lousy pay, Aoi still hopes to fulfill the promise that she and her friends made.  
Shirobako is an anime about making making anime. Now I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking right now that Shirobako is a documentary that was turned into an anime and all they do is ask the employee a load of questions about the anime industry. In other words, a boring anime version -- episode documentary. You sir/mam....couldn't be any more wrong. Calling this a documentary is just laughable.  
The anime industry is a niche market. Just by looking at the sales, you'll immediately notice it. In the anime industry, selling...Oh Idk....--k copies is considered successful but in reality, it's not. Compare that to, let's say the movie industry or the Western TV industry..Hell, compare the anime industry to a Japanese Live-Action/Drama TV and you'll notice that --k copies is not a lot. The industry is also a horrible place to work in. Being overworked and the salary that you get every month is barely enough to spend on yourself. Even so, we still see how much effort and hard work these guys put in just to produce a - cour anime show. Shirobako does a great job presenting the harsh atmosphere of the industry but that doesn't mean that the way they showed it is fully realistic. There were some fictional stuff and it's really not a problem since Shirobako never claimed to be a realistic ""how animes are made"" show. It's close enough to realism though. 
While Shirobako shows us the life in the anime industry, they also shows us  the process that the staff goes through just to produce a - cour series. For example, I never knew up to this point that the amount of Key Animation one episode has is a lot. I thought they would just draw the characters and make the characters move using a computer but it turns out that they all make them move by hand (or maybe some Motion Captures). No wonder, there aren't a lot of - cour series. It just goes to show how much work these guys put in and people would just fucking pirate the show.  
One of the many things I love about the series isn't about the cute - girls. It's the - girls doing everything they can to meet their goals. We see them fail and we see them stand up again and not giving up. It was also interesting to see the staff in the studio all working together to create an anime show that we all consume. Even if they fail, they still try their best to to meet their goals. The grand power of teamwork, if I say so myself.  
The show is separated into two arcs. The first half of the series focuses on the staff of Musashino Animation producing an original anime called ""Exodus"". It's fictional so don't bother searching for it on Google. In the -nd half of the series, the company has been given a new project and this time, adapting a popular manga called ""Third Aerial Girls' Squad"". I love each of the arcs for very different reasons. In the first arc, we see all the issues that an anime studio might and will face when producing an original anime. Issues such as time frame, the director not being able to come up with ideas, and etc. There are at least - scenes in the first half that I found interesting.  
Firstly, the director not giving up and trying his hardest to finish ""Exodus"". Exodus is his chance to prove that he's not a shitty director after that train wreck anime that he caused called ""Jiggly Jiggly Heaven"" (which is equivalent to P.A Work's Glasslip). The -nd one is the part where the director wanted to change a -- second short scene. I honestly can't believe it. Because of the director wanting to change that short scene, we see Aoi and the staff scramble just to change a short scene. The amount of time and work put in by the staff just to change said scene is really mind-boggling.     
The -nd half really caught my eye. I feel like the -nd half was a lot better than the first arc. It gives us an understanding on the process the studio goes through when adapting a material, in this case, adapting a manga. You know, I'm starting to understand why some animes that are adapted from a LN or a manga with such great story turns out to be so shitty when adapted into an anime version. It's really all on the author's hands whether he/she wants the studio to properly adapt his/her work or poorly adapt his/her work because he/she just doesn't give a shit. It's also based on how much agreements or disagreements between the author and the studio have and of course, the amount of episodes the show is allowed to produce on one season. There's also the difference in character designs between the anime and the source material and etc. Basically, the -nd half half shows us the amount of issues that the studio has to deal with just to adapt a source material and I really loved the way they presented those issues.  
There are - more points that I have to talk about. The comedy and the pacing. The show does not lack comedy nor is it over-bombarded with comedy. It's just a right amount of comedy. If I could post a video in my review, I would post the ""Angel Dance/Exercise"" scene because that scene was hilarious as hell. Secondly is the pacing. The first few episodes started out really slow which caused some people to just drop the show. I wasn't really bored with the slow pacing on the first few episodes so that wasn't an issue for me. The pacing did kind of pick up on the -nd half.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Art/Animation]: (--/--) 
For a slice-of-life anime, I'm amazed at the show's animation. From characters to the background to how the environment looks, it looks so perfect and amazing. It's really a rarity for a slice-of-life show to have an animation that you'd only expect in action shows. P.A Works means ""Progressive Animation Works"" just in case you didn't know and they are definitely living up to their name. You know what I love about P.A Works? Their shows does not sexualize female characters and there's rarely any fanservice. Actually, there was one fanservice scene in Episode - but that's it. You don't see any fanservice scenes again. Even though some of the female characters here looks cute and beautiful, they don't have big breasts. I would love it if every anime studio treats their female characters with respect and follows P.A Works' non-existent fanservice.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Sound]: (-.-/--) 
The soundtrack is what you'd expect from a slice-of-life show..You know, like those soundtrack that usually plays when the tone of the show is dramatic or cheery or when they're having a normal conversation. Now, the OP and ED theme song(s).  
The OP theme songs are ""I'm Sorry EXODUS"" by Tracy (Mai Nakahara, Shizuka Itou, Ai Kayano), ""COLORFUL BOX"" by Yoko Ishida, and ""Takarabako -TREASURE BOX-"" by Masami Okui. The ED theme songs are Animetic Love Letter"" by Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Shizuka Sakaki, ""Platinum Jet"" by Doughnut Quintet, and ""Yama Harinezumi Andes Chucky"" by Miyuki Kunitake  
I consider the first - OP theme songs as - OP theme song separated into - two versions. That should make it easier for me. The first version is really catchy. It makes me want to race with someone on the street, just like what Aoi and a certain staff member from G.I Staff were doing. The -nd version is a great song, in my opinion. I love the singer's voice. The -nd OP...three words, I.Love.It! and I think it's way better than the first OP theme song. For the ED theme songs, I love the -nd ED theme song and that's it. I don't like the -st ED and I hate the -rd ED. Although, someone might feel nostalgic just by watching and listening to the -rd ED.   
______________________________________________________________ 
[Characters]: (-/--) 
Shirobako has a large cast of characters and they introduced most -- if not -- all of them in the first and -nd episode. I have a very hard time remembering Japanese names because I don't speak Japanese and I'm exposed to Western names pretty much every single day. They also have those last name, first name usage crap so that makes it even harder for me. My point is the show introduced the characters with no exposition whatsoever. They are introduced by having their names pop up on the top right/left hand of the screen.  It wasn't until the early -nd half where I managed to remember all of the main character's name and some of the side character's name. Anyways... 
Most of the characters are great..They're entertaining, the character interactions are sometimes hilarious and fun to watch and surprisingly, there 's character development in a slice-of-life series. Notice how I said ""Most""? There's one character in show which I found really annoying and that's Taro. I admit, he's kind of hilarious but he's fucking annoying. He's like one of my friends who screws everything up when I/we have him as a partner on some certain projects. Did I say one character? I lied..There's at least one more character who's ---% worse than Taro and I'll talk about him later.   
The main characters knows that it's not easy to enter the anime industry and yet, they didn't lost hope and kept going so they can fulfill their dream of working together and one day, turn their anime ""The Seven Lucky Gods"" into a reality. After high school, life is not going to be easy and most of us knows that. There are going to be times where the situation won't go in your favor and there will be times where you're going to be rejected on something like entering a certain industry just because someone is better than you even if you worked your ass off for like over a year. Life ain't easy and Shirobako did a great job showing us that. I'll use Shizuka Sakaki as an example because her pursuit of becoming a Voice Actor really touched me more than the other characters. Shizuka is shown to have attended auditions upon auditions but kept getting rejected because there are people that's always going to be better than her. We see that even though she works hard to get the role, she just doesn't get picked for said role. When she finally got a role in the latter half of the show, I actually cried a little bit because I know that feeling of being rejected countless times and having your hard work finally being paid off. 
Like I said above, I love the characters in the show. Especially that female character who barely speaks and Ema is pretty much her interpreter and she also somehow answers her unfinished questions. You know, I'm wondering how she passed that job interview but hey, the show did never claim to be fully realistic. Ema and Ai's character interactions is one of the entertaining and hilarious interactions in the show. They all have great personality and you'll pretty much like everyone in the show...except the ""Mr. Funny Story"" guy and probably Taro.  
I'll just call that asshole editor ""Mr. Funny Story"" because I don't know his name. You will definitely, and I mean definitely hate this guy. ""Mr. Funny Story"" here didn't want the staff of Musashino Animation to meet the author of ""Third Aerial Girls' Squad"", thus causing the production to be halted many many times and sometimes even scrapping the Key Animation cuts that they already drew. Because of him, I thought the author was a two-timed son of a bitch but it turns out, the editor is just a big asshat who glorifies the author as some sort of God.   
______________________________________________________________ 
[Enjoyment]: (--/--) 
I really thought Shirobako was going to be boring because of the concept. I didn't find the show boring though. I managed to watch all -- episodes without sleeping and I was always engaged in what the characters were doing and the situation around them. What a fun ride this show was and -- episodes just passed by way too quickly.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[VERDICT] 
""Shirobako"" is simply an amazing anime and it's definitely one of the most underrated anime that I have ever seen. If you want to take a break from all the cliche harem shows with girls screaming ""Iya! One-chaaan!!"" and all the big boobs being flashed at your face then you might want to give this show a try. If you're interested in learning how animes are made then this is definitely the show for you. However, I gotta warn you that this anime is simply not for everyone. The complaints that you might have are: there's a lot of talking and it's just office meetings. Otherwise, this anime is a must-watch! 
[OVERALL]: (-.-/--) 
Pros: 
+""How Animes are made"" concept executed properly 
+Accurate depiction of how animes are made and produced 
+P.A Works living up to their name 
+Great Soundtrack and Great OP and ED theme song(s) 
+Female characters aren't sexualized

Sometimes in life, you're forced to make a choice.  Many times, actually, such as what you want to eat, what you want to study, what kind of job you want, and even who you want to marry.  But rarely does one have to make one that affects your life entirely, creating a divergent that can separate who you will become later on.  This time, to finalize my week of writing anime reviews, Ookami Kodomo no Ame no Yuki, or, wolf children.   
Story (-.--/--):  The story of wolf children follows the story of Hana, a young woman who starts college in the hopes of pursing the city life.  As she begins school, she notices a man who seemed distant and far away from the rest of the class.  She then begins to pursue said man, and learns that he is a wolf, and slowly, the two fall in love.  After giving birth to two children, and a few heart wrenching circumstances, Hana and her two children, Yuki and Ame, move out into the countryside where they begin a new life, where their mother gives them two paths to go down, pursue the path of the wild as a wolf, or walk to the city path as a human.   
From an idea standpoint, the movie is rather simple, involving a very easy to follow plot, as the story focuses only on the -- years that Hana spends raising her two children.  The way it was executed was quite unbalanced, I felt.  The beginning was quite sped up with the whole ""prologue"" part with the children and the college romance, while the end was very drawn out and long.  There was even a few timeskips here and there that served only to give a general synopsis of what had happened within that year.  While the pacing isn't the most even, when you watch this movie, you probably won't care due to how well written the story actually is. 
Whenever you have a movie, you're always forced into this small little time frame, where you're limited to how much material you can put into it, meaning there most likely be some plot holes or whatever.  This movie does not have that.  In fact, disregarding the pacing, the movie does itself proud by working with the - hour time frame it was given, and ultimately conveying the story that it wanted to convey.  Unless the tears I shed while watching this movie gives any indication, the movie does give its idea out completely. 
Overview 
+  Very well written story 
+  Worked well with its time frame 
-  Somewhat uneven pacing (this can be overlooked) 
Characters (-.--/--):  While the story was well executed, I found the characters to be a smidge lacking in comparison to the story.  They were still REALLY good characters, but because of the aforementioned time frame that an anime movie is forced into, the characters I felt didn't reach their complete mother. 
First, is Hana.  Hana is probably the #- mother of the year.  She literally spends her days in the early parts of the film, raising two children by herself, fixing a run down house from the ground up, plant and grow her own crops from unfarmable land, and having to deal with two children growing children that are also wolves.  Above all, she doesn't complain at all, and wears a smile the whole time she's doing it, like it's not too big of a deal.  If that doesn't say anything about perseverance and willpower, I don't know what will.  At the beginning of the movie, Hana is the main focal point, having to deal with the trials and tribulations of her new life mentioned above.  As the movie goes on, she sort of takes a back seat in terms of focus, as her maturing children start to take the prominent role.  She's still a main focus, but not as much.  Throughout the movie, she is shown to be a very caring mother, giving her children the choice of choosing which side of their blood they want to pursue towards, ultimately being happy with whatever her children do.  Personally, I feel like this sort of thinking in the movie, is what made me cry tears of happiness the most.  It's because of this idea of being accepting your loved ones with whatever they turn out to be, that this story is so touching, and heartwarming. 
Next is Ame and Yuki.  (I felt like pairing them up.)  These two children are the main focal point of the whole movie, and thus why this movie is called Wolf Children.  Birthed from a man who was a part wolf, and a woman who was completely human, the two have both human and wolf blood within them, causing them to sporadically change from wolf to human, and back at any moment's notice.  Like most children, they begin out as blank slates.  A child is born without any sense of what is right or wrong, what is good or bad, and requires the guidance in order to mold them into the person they will turn out to be.  These two are no different.  As the movie goes along, the two children begin to find their own paths, ultimately becoming the different beings that the audience sees at the end.  What I like about these two, are the fact that they accurately represent the way people are created.  We all require outside forces such as our parents, and friends, in order to become the person we are today, and this movie represents that in a very heartwarming fashion.  However, the children are subjected to the short time frame as well, so their development isn't completely explained, and more then likely, you're going to have to just go along with it whenever something new pops up that wasn't explained. 
With the main - characters, comes a load of supporting cast that don't really have too much character.  The majority of them help Hana and her children with their lives, and not much else.  Not that that's wrong, but that is essentially the role that they play.   
Overview 
+  Awesome mother main character 
+  Well done execution of a child's growth 
+  Very good supporting cast that helped with the plot 
-   Few missing details on the main characters 
Art and Sound (-.--/-- and -.--/--):  The art in this movie is rather simple.  While the backgrounds look extraordinary as all hell, the actual people and whatnot were rather simple.  There were times when the movie had distant shots of people, and their faces weren't there.  Even the general character designs weren't all too glamourous or convoluted.  The clothes were also quite bland to, mostly will just a single color taking up an entire piece of clothing.  The art itself wasn't bad, in fact, it actually fit with the story and the movie as a whole, but when you judge it by itself, the art style is quite simple.   
The sound on the other hand is awe-inspiring.  The tracks for this movie are filled with vocal songs and piano parts that add to the movie's serenity and calming nature.  Throughout the whole movie, they play this sort of music, and it works in the movie's favor.  It makes the scenes a lot more heart-wrenching/warming, adds the mysticalness of the idea of raising hybrid children, and even finishing off the movie with a wonderful ending which I must say, is rather perfect.   
Now, for voice acting.  (Whenever I watch a dub, I always like commentating on the voice acting.  I prefer subs, but I was too lazy to search for a sub after seeing the first result pop up with it dubbed.)  The dub I feel is quite good.  The characters have voices that work with the characters, (except Ame's older voice.  He's like --.  No -- year old I know sounds that deep.)  and ultimately, I felt like the viewing experience was quite good for a dubbed version.  All in all, this dub is definitely a keeper. 
Overview 
+  VERY good soundtrack 
+  Good background art 
+  Dub approved 
-   Rather simple characters (again, can be overlooked.) 
Personal Enjoyment (--/--):  I have not cried this much about a movie/anime, since Clannad Afterstory, because that show's tough to beat in terms of emotion.  When I first heard about how touching it was, I was rather intrigued.  When I got the guts to watch it, I was sitting in my chair trying to hold it all in.  This story is beautiful,  It brings the idea of family into a whole new light, and explains what a parent must go through when raising children; giving birth, raising them as babies, teaching them manners and moral understandings, and then letting go.  (I am still crying over this movie as I'm writing it.  My heart is WAY too fragile!)  I connected to me with how what I aspire to do in life, and I just felt happier for watching it.  
All in all, I felt like this was a great viewing experience.  The negatives of this review that I mentioned become obsolete once you start watching it, and in the end, it touched me the same way Clannad did.  This is a movie that everyone should watch.  It's very cute, it has a nice end, and above all, gives a new perspective to how anime can be.  I hope that anyone who reads this who hasn't watched it, goes and watches it, because I guarantee you, it will be worth your time. 
Overall Score: (-.--/--) 
Little Note:  There's a short -- second bestiality-esque scene in the movie, so...keep that in mind if you want to watch it.

A good series overall, especially considering when it was created. 
There are issues though! 
-. The number of times you are watching it, enjoying yourself and then there is a -- second period where nothing happens or the same words are repeated is just ridiculous. 
-. The initial character developments are good, especially on the main character, which turns him from self loathing and semi-useless to an actually likeable human being. However, the series then cancels all of the development as they please and transform him back to useless at random points. To be honest it is just infuriating 
-. I honestly don't know who the main antagonist ""SEELE"" is. No explanation is given and we don't even know if they are the antagonist or if it is Shinji's father. The series gives no indication of good or bad nor explains these organisations well enough. The series constantly starts to explain something and then drops the explanation leaving (me anyway) more confused than earlier. E.g. i thought the evangellion were robots, then they had souls, but thats it, no more explantion. I can handle robots, but angel robots with a soul inside etcetc is just confusing without more explanation. 
-. They developed some characters and proceeded to just ignore them. These were the -th child, the class prefect girl and Shinji's friend with glasses. You know what, include the penguin too, i liked the penguin he could have been fun. 
-. The ending. Tbh the last two episodes were super confusing and had almost ruined the series for me. BUT, the last part of the episode clears up a lot of what happens. But if one final episode just to clarify had been released it would have been so much better. Was shinji in some kind of simulation from the start? Did he die and that was his final moment of thought (realising that he had done the right thing and would finally be loved as he always wanted) 
Good parts of the series: 
-. the storyline is really good, and has interesting philosophical concepts in them. 
-. The battles, while frustrating at times as the standard ""we lost connection to evangellion"" always hapens they are full of suspense. Its not the standard instakilling of bad guys, but stuff goes wrong and leads to character development and is entertaining overall.

I finally finished watching this, and probably won't be watching another season of the title. I couldn't decide whether to give it -/-- or -/--, and decided on -/--. Detailed breakdown is below. 
Overall: 
The anime is very good at wasting viewer's time. 
In its structure it is a very typical shounen anime, except that instead of fighting we have dramatic cooking. I found the anime to be boring and yawn-inducing most of the time, however there were few episodes which sparked my interest a bit. The ""food is so good that it makes people orgasm"" joke gets old -rd time you see it, which happens quickly. The anime shares all the problems of a typical shounen anime. Meaning you have characters talking (during a ""fight"") most of the episode while camera slowly pans around. You have gasping/shocked onlookers saying stuff like it ""I can't believe he used ingredient X""(which is typically followed by -- minute long explanation of ingridient X), which is followed by a ""counter"" from an opponent, more talking and more explanation. 
The anime isn't ecchi, even though there are ""ecchi"" pictures of people tasting food. The problem is that those pictures aren't funny, aren't sexy, and aren't very interesting. So this joke just gets old fast. 
The story sorta progresses, but it progresses slowly and doesn't exactly reach a conclusion. judging by the pacing I suspect that the creators want to milk the anime for at least - more seasons.  
I also felt like the whole season could be made - times shorter (-- episodes) without losing anything. 
Animation: 
The anime uses every trick known to shounen anime in order to cut production costs. There are A LOT of scenes where you'll see something animated in - frames being slowly panned with sparkling sfx and LOOONG explanations, usually describing some sort of food. You'll spend a lot of time starting at this or that unanimated food ingredient being displayed on screen. When the series finally animate something properly, it looks good, but it doesn't happen very often. Despite that, I can say that the studio does fairly decent job hiding their ""cost cutting tricks"", but at some point you'll start to wonder why are there so many ""camera panning slowly while somebody talks"" scenes. 
Art: 
I loved designs of some of side characters, especially designs of their faces. Several of side characters (mostly girls) have a great design of faces, and their costumes are well drawn too. While the anime cuts animation costs at every opportunity it gets (with the annoying ""let's pan something slowly while explaining something about current ingredient of the week""), I haven't noticed any ""cheap"" backgrounds, cheaply drawn characters or anything like that. It is mostly solid, with few side characters looking great (ikumi, erina, and one of the judges whose name I forgot). 
Characters: 
Ikumi is a highlight of the series, her reactions are somewhat interesting. The rest of the characters are pretty much either faceless or cliched/stereotypical. They follow typical shounen tropes, meaning there will be ""opponents"" acting in absolutely ridiculous fashion in order to display how ""evil"" they are, which is cringeworthy. and makes a lot of interactions cliched or non-believable. The protagonist is forgettable, he is a typical ""shounen with spiky haircut"" with cookie-cutter personality. Only Ikumi and maybe Erina has some semblance of a characters the rest are just walking cliches/shounen tropes. 
Music: 
The anime apparently has a good composer, but it feels like that composer is underutilized. in a few places of the anime there were few ""scary"" musical scores, and they were good/interesting. However, most of the time the anime keeps playing the same ""battle"" theme on the loop, and while this theme is okay, it is not great to keep listening to it that often. 
Enjoyement: 
Most of the time I was thinking ""why am I watching this?"". -st episode was okay, few episodes in the middle were okay (there was a moment I thought it would get better), and the last episode was okay too. The rest was incredibly boring, artificially prolonged, very tedious and frankly just plain bad. 
Bottom line: 
I haven't read the manga, but I suspect it might be a better idea to check manga instead. Overall I have impression that anime problems are caused by it being a manga adaptation (and not a very good one). Those slow panning scenes with someone talking might work well in manga (because while you're reading a LOOONG explanation, you might have some cool art to look at), but they don't feel right in anime. There are - or - visually interesting side characters (as I said, art style is decent and some of the character desiigns are great) but they alone are hardly worth watching -- episodes of this. 
So, the best suggestion would be to skip, unless you really want to see those - girl characters with nice designs, or unless you really enjoy shounen shows.

Before I begin, allow me to vent a bit. *deep breath* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOD WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? WHY DOES IT EXIST!?!?!? *cries* 
Okay, now that that's out of the way... 
Dragon Ball, in my eyes, is the biggest insult to the anime community entirely in general. The only two positives i see from my point of view are that (-.) It was an entrance into the Japanese animation community for many, and (-.) It's style of formula inspired many other anime to this very day. But beyond that, there's nothing positive I can say about Dragon Ball or it's successors. Seriously, I wanted to hang myself every time I tried watching an episode. I'm still in shock that I finished every episode of the original. But that doesn't change much. 
The plot of Journey to the We--I mean Dragon Ball, is Son Goku going on a quest to be stronger. However, this goal has become quite questionable in recent times, as all he has to do is shout a bunch and *poof* he's a ""god"". By the end of the original show and every episode of every show following it, it's just gotten to the point of a competition over who has the worst constipation, and it's just...ridiculous. I know the shouting of abilities has become a quite common trope in numerous types of shows to this day, even with ones that aren't even animated at all, but it doesn't change the fact, nor justify it, that Dragon Ball has too many battle cries. I mean, hell, they even shout their abilities in anime I enjoy, such as Sword Art Online, Noragami (although that's less shouting, and more chanting), and hell, even One Punch Man. 
In summary, I hate the entire Dragon Ball series for it's lofty plot, the overused sound effects, and it's overly severe use of it's own tropes. But hey, this is just my opinion. I won't say you shouldn't check it out.

*Non-spoiler review* 
Purely based on the personal opinion of an avid anime viewer. 
That feeling that you've lost something or someone, and spending your life searching for it. That same feeling that you got when you watched Your Name, is basically what you're going to get when watching this special, which is a continuation of the series. 
The anime itself is nothing special, since the art, high school setting, characters are all rather 'generic' in a sense, but the premise is still rather interesting. Strangely enough though, you'll find yourself attached to these characters. You'll be rooting for all of them, and I think you should. 
The conclusion is satisfying, leaving no loose ends. You'll even get this nice warm feeling, and might even feel motivated to live life to the fullest. Of course, it's probably going to be different for everyone, but even so, I think this anime is well worth watching. 
My recommendation is to just sit back and enjoy the ups and downs. You won't regret it.

[The Chibi Zone] 
There is an anime series beyond that which is known to viewers. It is a series as small as its main characters, and as short as any three minute video. It is the middle ground between promotional videos and full length -- minute episodes, between hand-drawn manga illustrations and computer animations, and it lies between the whites of one’s eyes and the screen of one’s monitor. This is a series of super deformed characters. It is an art style which we call chibi.  Next stop, the Chibi Zone! 
STORY: 
You notice there are twelve episodes, each comprising - minutes and -- seconds.  However, upon viewing several episodes, you notice each episode has a -- second opening song, followed by two minutes of actual animation and story, then a -- second ending song, and finally -- second of closing credits.  Disappointing, I know. 
For the story, you will watch the daily lives of twin sisters, Rise and Airi, and their older brother who has a sister complex. You watch their daily life occurrences include: taking care of his sick sister, cooking meals, going to festivals, wearing a maid uniform, competitions, and opening a cafe. In the end, though, it’s mostly about the older brother being surrounded by many cute girls, such as his twin sisters, the sister’s friends, and the female manager. Still, you realize it’s far too short and boring, even for the Chibi Zone. 
ANIMATION: 
As expected in the Chibi Zone, you realize that every character is a chibi with their classic characteristics: minimum facial details, large head with a tiny body, bright and vibrant colors, and wearing simple clothes with minimum details. The bright background designs compliments the chibi characters by appearing cheap and lacking details as well.  And finally, the animations will sometimes be stiff and jerky with many shots jumping from one scene to the next in quick succession.  You, of course, notice that the characters sometimes become their non-chibi forms, but disregard it as it’s very generic looking. 
SOUND: 
You hear two songs both of which are J-Pop in origin.  The opening song contains many chibi characters yelling, “Say Hi!” in a upbeat, loud high-pitched voice, and the ending song contains several still shots of characters in various clothes and poses.  Along with those sounds, you also hear the fine voice acting, and many random sound effects for every action the characters perform. 
CHARACTERS: 
You will watch undeveloped, forgettable, two-dimensional characters with no background stories and little personalities talking, eating, and frolicking to the end of every episode.  You realize the older brother’s only redeemable features are being kind and cooking meals, while the girls are all extremely cute and like the older brother very much. You also realize that there’s a lack of investment and attachment to these characters because the series is too short and throws them into random mundane events and situations that you could care less about. 
ENJOYMENT: 
I hope you enjoyed your time in the Chibi Zone because I didn’t.  Hopefully, the Chibi Zone will return under a better anime than this one.

My Review will have some things that may be considered spoilers for some but, judge for yourself, or not... I'll try to keep it at minimum. 
Well, the art is pretty good looking, despite the abrupt change in the look of some characters, specially ---, that is completly unrecognizable, I kept asking myself who was that one, lol. But that doesn't bother me at all, I'm no fan freak for appeareances and that kind of stuff. 
The problem with the series is with its inconsistencies in the plot and characters motivations. 
I'll point just a few or the list will become too long: 
-- It is revealed that one of the Cyborgs have a special power that may frustrate the villian plan, nothing is done with that. 
-- The plot develops around an mysterious object and its contents, the solution is pretty damn easy (to don't say forced) and then the series resumes itself in a talk about feelings and friendship... 
-- They can't decide if they are strong or weak against the UNG droid armors, sometimes they get their ass kicked, sometimes they disarm them or just ignore them completly, it is also said that their weapons can't affect but they do have a weapon to affect them that is revealed at the end. 
-- You know the vampire myth where you can only enter a house if you are invited? Well, it is just how they solve one of the ""dangerous"" situations the villian was like: ""Hey, you there, outside of my well protected and fortified door, why don't you come in my safe room that have basically no protection to have a have a chat. Ow, dont be silly, you just destroyed half of the base"" 
I tought on a lot more but couldnt think in a way to talk about them without spoiling them, hope it was helpfull somehow.

Because I love visual novels and am a huge fan of Key's works, I read the visual novel before watching the anime. I loved it. Although not my favorite, it sparked emotions in me I never knew existed. In most cases (that I've seen at least), when a visual novel is adapted into an anime, it sucks. Therefore, I dove into the show with moderately small expectations, and left extremely happy. Both this and After Story follow the original main plot incredibly well, and the animation is great. They didn't change the fantastic soundtrack too much, which is one of Clannad's best aspects in my opinion.  
Overall, Clannad the anime is awesome. If you have not already seen it, do so now along with After Story.

**Let me just pour some tea out of my now contaminated flask that without a doubt violates all kinds of lab conduct for a dumb gimmick.  Aren’t I such a quirky character?  Now I’m going to info dump the entire plot to you in the most boring way possible.** 
Asugawa Saguta once said “Once the class takes shape it doesn’t change easily.” It’s pretty ironic that this encapsulates the trend of modern anime light novels and their adaptations.  But alas, I’m not here to trash on all adaptations, just this one. 
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai’s shot composition is mostly flat.  This is typical for anime, but since I’ve become used to actual well directed anime and film such as Masaaki Yuasa and Satoshi Kon’s works, this blows.  Lighting and color aren’t taken into account in the slightest. 
The music is repetitive, and isn’t even that good.  It tries way too hard to be emotionally manipulative, and really doesn’t work. 
The characters are bland, and any attempt at evoking pathos falls straight on its face. 
The backgrounds are ugly.  They’re bright, but have a plastic feel.  Granted, most anime are like this now, but it looks so cheap.  
The character animation is disjointed.  In certain shots it looks like there’s maybe --- frames a second.  The art is hit or miss, which is such a detrimental part of a show with limited animation.  Some of the stills that have little movement are just so ugly.  The cg crowds are pretty awful as well. 
The writing is just dreadful after the second arc.  The second arc is decent, but not quite as good as the first.  After those two arcs the story becomes way too melodramatic.  With all the technical issues I’ve already mentioned, this drop in writing quality is extremely apparent.   
Now onto nitpicks. 
The pseudo science is just dumb, character designs are all bad except for Mai, and the little sister’s voice actress is so obnoxious.  Nails on a chalkboard.   
I’d give the first arc a -/-- 
Second -.-/-- 
Everything else -/--.  After watching half of episode -- I had to give up. 
So I’m being generous and giving it a -/--, simply for the first arc.

A short warning: This is kind of long and I'm a bit of a potty-mouth (I tried to take the cursing out, but some might still be in there). Also, please leave some feedback, especially if you don't like the review. All criticism is appreciated. 
The setting is basically this: The Robotics Club at Central Tanegashima High School want to build a huge mecha, and the series follows its members in their struggles with funding and other stuff. Pretty basic. Obviously there's more under the surface than the characters just going at it with spanners, including a mystery slowly being revealed about a conspiracy that would severely endanger a sweeping majority of the people on Earth. It's pretty far-fetched and we're never given a proper explanation why the plan is in motion any way. The series is very episodic and each episode usually focuses on one of the side characters and how Kaito fits in and helps them. 
To begin with some negativity, my main gripe with the series, is that it feels so very standard. Generic is another word I could use, but it feels too negative. Robotics;Notes takes what you find in most series nowadays: A cast of rather quirky characters that compliment each-other's quirk/weirdness and go with it. It embraces the stereotypic tropes usually associated with anime and doesn't shy away from using them. 
A positive to be found is that the animation is of very good quality. It's not Makoto Shinkai level of quality, but not much out there is. I'm far from an artist myself, so that's about all I'll say about it. One of the few good things with the series. 
As far as the voice acting, it's  mostly solid. Fukuda Nobuaki stands out as ""Doc"" in an emotional episode at about the middle of the series. Most others are good, but not outstanding. Part of the soundtrack stand out, but others are pretty run-of-the-mill pieces. Sound department ends up being a little above average, all things considered. 
To the characters:  
Akiho (the female protagonist) is super energetic and ambitious, while Kaito (male protagonist) is when the series begins depicted as a sloth and generally disinterested in doing anything but playing Kill-Ballad (an on-line fighting game with mechas) which he apparently is one of the top people in the world at. As the series goes forward, Kaito's character is all over the place. Junna is what I like to put in the category of ""moe-blob. Basically, she's a throwaway character that's in the series to be cute and once or twice pop into the main plot-line for an episode or two. Contrasting her is Subaru, ambitious and helpful dude, who was told by his father to stop building, and competing with, robots. Then there's Kona, the epitome of stereotypic nerds in Japanese culture; She's a shut-in; almost entirely communicates in memes; is incredibly perverted and is generally pictured as a bit of a nut-case. That said, she does have a back-story that ties into the main story which is intriguing for the peculiarly short time it's given to develop. There's also the obligatory crazy director guy who's completely obsessed with boobs, and has a parrot that's trained (or is just damaged for being around him too long) to chant along in his craving for beholding boobs, as well as the oddball teacher who seems to be the most stupid and unreliable person on earth, but ends up being a person you should count on. You know you've seen these character types before if you've watched more than a couple anime. 
A big problem the series has initially, is the fact that it takes a long time to get going. It starts with an in medias res scene, with the group starting up a big mecha and getting it started. After that we're showed the lives and struggles of Akiho and Kaito in their strife to get the robot working. They get some more members shortly, but the two are unquestionably the main characters. So, basically, the first episodes are for introducing the characters and the basic plot, which is usually fine. The problem is that the main characters aren't really that interesting, and neither is the main story to begin with. Viewers who stick around will have a passable series to watch, but there's not a whole lot keeping you in attached to the show or its characters. Let's see why: 
The characters, with focus on the main characters: 
Kaito - the series main protagonist, mind you- is an extremely bland and terribly boring character. He rarely shows interest in doing anything at all and seems to be sticking around ""just because"". In the beginning, coming off as eternally sceptical and non-committal, though at times showing intense caring and emotion, Kaito is a character that's all over the place, everything at once. It's not that he breaks out of his usual behaviour once or twice, it's that he doesn't have a starting point. Which is something you can say about the series as well. 
Akiho - sharing main protagonist duties with Kaito - is a very energetic character who strongly believes in herself and her vision of building the robot her sister started building years previously. I can see her being a character that splits the audience, like a Haruhi. Infectious and happy-go-lucky personality that can alienate some viewers and enamour others. 
The most glaring problem with the side-characters is that they're used mainly as plot devices. Characters pop in and out of relevance when it's convenient to the story, and few are consistent throughout the series. So, even when there are scenes that are supposed to evoke emotional responses, we as viewers haven't been given enough to care about the characters and their fates. Every scene should get some sort of reaction or give you something as a viewer. Tons of scenes and some episodes could and should have been cut out to give the viewer more information and background. 
The story, which takes the back seat to introducing the characters. The mecha launching stuff in the opening moments of the show is a set-up for other things to happen in the second half of the series and the main story takes a few episodes to even enter the series. The story is told very episodically, in fragments between the episode-long character arcs, where you get more information about the characters and at times ending that characters arc entirely. Like seriously, what ever happened to Subaru's dad going at him for still being into robots? Did he just chill out after Subaru picked one apart in front of him? It was never very clear in the series, or at least not given enough time to appreciate what the arc ultimately did for the character (nothing at all). 
It does pick up a considerable amount later, with some emotional episodes and big events and twists. The middle part of the series is easily its best. Though, with the characters being horribly, infuriatingly uneven, it's hard to fully enjoy the series. Also, some scenes are so ridiculously improbable and out of the blue that any seriousness it's trying to get across gets lost. 
Now, I've been ragging on it a lot, but honestly, Robotics;Notes is an enjoyable show at times. It's passable as a watch, but if I were to decide on it being good or bad, I have to go with bad. With the story presented, the show has the potential to be a great show, but there are like six episodes dedicated to the story when the disappointing endgame rolls in, filled with deus ex machinas. 
To summarise: The series does a poor job at getting the attention and sympathies of it's viewers to begin with and the pacing is way off from where it should be to tell a story that you, as a viewer, should become invested in. Main characters aren't able to carry the show on their own, and as a result the show is pretty flat in the end. It's almost fun how much we're meant to take for granted without any explanation at all. As such, it fails in doing what any series striving to be considered a serious work should do: Make the viewer care. It certainly has some sweet feel-good moments, but they hardly weigh up the series' shortcomings. It's a good try, but in the end it fails more than it succeeds. It falls short of the line between good and bad, and as such, I won't recommend this series to anyone. Maybe I would recommend an aspiring storyteller to watch it, just to know what pits in writing and storytelling to avoid, and that's certainly not something you would want written on the back of the DVD-case.

Starting Toradora was kinda interesting for me, the main reason why I picked it up was that I was told through a friend that it's one of the best (if not the best) anime in its type of genre. Curious on that claim, I decided to give it a shot to see if it met my expectations. 
The story itself is pretty simple and basic, taiga loves ryuuji's best friend, and vice versa for ryuuji to taiga's best friend. Both decide to help each other out in following their love's path set out for them. As the show goes on though, it becomes less about trying to get together with who they love, and more about understanding why they love, who they really love, what love really is. I won't lie, it's probably a really predictable story on how it ends since it certainly won't shock anyone by the ending, but the show is not about the ending; it's about the progression to that ending. 
I think what stuck out to me most about toradora was its characters, and I don't mean just the main ones of taiga and ryuuji. I mean pretty much the whole cast of characters are incredibly dynamic, they change over the course of the show, learn, grow with the viewer. Even characters like the homeroom teacher and class president who don't get anywhere near as much screen time as most of the cast really do learn and evolve into better people. The character interactions are quite amazing and beautifully woven together to really show how the characters grow from each other. Nothing feels forced or nonsensical; every characters actions and emotions feels very real and relatable. For such a simple story, it really is fleshed out marvelously by these extremely dynamic characters, and really makes the viewer feel at home and engaged from beginning to end. 
Toradora is definitely a show that met my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the genre it tops at. Extremely lovable and relatable characters that make a basic story turn into a highly enjoyable experience from beginning to end will make you wish the show doesn't end when it does. It's a show that more likely than not will grow on me as time goes on, maybe becoming my favorite anime of all time.

I'm very Very Very Very Very-x Mad to the creators of this anime. 'cause yesterday while finishing episode -- and i keep on telling to myself that i can't w- to watch the next episode and then when i notice that i've only download -- episode 'cause maybe i just missed the other one and i rush and check it to the list of episode in the net and then when i saw it  I started to scream NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO it has only -- episode what the F*** they just cut to black.  If you gonna start something at least try to finish it. This anime is totally a cliffhanger.  
To be honest i really like the story 'cause it was easy to watch and i really like Urara she reminded of the band ELT(Every Little Thing) to their single Urara and she's the only reason why i'm watching this anime 'cause i really love her personality she's strong,kind and lovely the main guy was very lucky to have her even he keeps on rejecting her,urara still have the smile that can light up the world.  
The anime have ended -- years ago so maybe it's not to late to have a second season or an OVA LOL. We may never know what will happen next to urara will she and touma will end up together? maybe in the manga you can just read it after you watch the anime so that you will know what will happen next 'cause i know they have completed and finish the manga and all the main plot holes will be answered i guess.

Welcome to the N.H.K.'s greatest contribution is how effectively it portrays reality whilst conjuring up our demons.  My criticism with it is with how it struggles to tie its pieces together.  Solitude, love, and conspiracies are at times thrown around like a hot potato to whomever is most convenient to portray, but those moments are the best parts.  A vast majority of the show moves from one narrow topic to the next in an annoyingly asinine way, but those few moments where these themes are present in multiples and also consistent are when the show is at its strongest. 
The moments between Satou and Hitomi are the best moments in the show, because they constantly tug you between all - major themes of solitude, love, and conspiracy.  The moments between Satou and the other characters lack the conspiracy aspect for all or most of the show, and while sometimes they convey a relatable feeling, for the most part they come off as weak .  The pinnacle of the show is the ""Off"" Meeting episodes, and if I could base my rating on this part alone, I would give it at least an -. 
So why a -?  The show keeps trying to distract you from its serious themes, which it does, but the way it does it is often so painfully obvious, with its cheap humor and stereotypes.  The rare times these heavy themes are covertly covered up are fantastically done, such as when bits of Misaki's past are unveiled, but the same magic trick only works again if the viewer hasn't caught on to the trick.

Fair. The story was fair. It didn't have much of a focus, but this is to be expected. It features several arcs and has a couple of characters that interact with each other. Yet there is barely any progress or character development. The characters were realistic, yet it wasn't a story. It was a series of events that happened to somebody in a chronological order with no theme or message. The only arguable theme is to stop being afraid of death, yet there was so little focus on it, it can be barely called that. However, Onei's relationship with her little sister, Onao, is quite touching. I almost cried. But as it failed to make me actually cry, it was alright. That small story is the only thing that somewhat redeems this movie. However, with so many arcs going on in the story, an ongoing series would suit the subject matter better. 
Despite its focus on traditional Japanese arts, the art was mediocre. The style wasn't something I liked, nor was it overly complicated or pretty. Several times some scenes were lacking too much in detail for it to be a movie made in ----. The animation has way too many still scenes, often very confusing as I have to check if there was anything wrong with my computer while watching it. Had they chosen a different art style - perhaps one that has a watercolour feeling similar to Legend of Kaguya, it would have been much preferable to this bland mix. 
The soundtrack can only be described as terrible. As a story set in ----'s Japan, someone would expect a more traditional soundtrack with minimal electrical sounds. However, we are introduced to the opening scene with an electric guitar as a background. During one of the last climatic scenes featuring Oei running, the electrical guitar played, creating a somewhat ridiculous effect. The soundtrack wasn't just bad, it was disorienting. It takes the viewer out of the setting of the story back into our lives in the modern world. When any good movie should let the viewer forget about their life, the soundtrack choice for this movie was more than appalling. However, there are very rare moments when the soundtrack sounded nice, preventing it from getting a simple ""-"" for its score. 
Overall, it wasn't a good movie. The soundtrack was terrible, the animation was mediocre, the story lacked focus, the characters didn't get properly developed, and the art style just might not be your cup of tea. 
-/--. And that's being generous because it almost made me cry.

Lemme tell you why you should watch Trigun: 
Cats 
BOOM. Now go watch it. 
I apologize, but I really have to indulge myself a wee bit when I partake in this writing-jane-doe-thinks-her-opinions-are-warranted fest thing. 
Trigun is a title that will consistently appear on lists of top --s anime, and with good reason! The soundtrack alone made me weak in the knees, and that was before I even had one eighth of an inkling as to what was going on. The show is set on an Old West themed, arid, harsh planet, and follows the story of Vash the Stampede (infamous gunslinger outlaw with a mysterious past) and the various friends he makes along the way. Two of his companions actually work for an insurance company that is trying to cut costs down by preventing Vash from causing anymore destruction, as nearly every town he passes through ends up being utterly totaled. 
Naturally, this anime has palpable similarities with Cowboy Bebop: from the inhumanly skilled but laid back main character to the interesting supporting cast, fans of both series will find themselves drawing parallels between the two, and that's a good thing! Something Trigun provides that is unique from Bebop is that, by the end of the series, significantly more questions are answered. Not all of them, mind you, but just enough that any viewer can walk away satisfied but still speculating on what could have happened in this universe. 
Some wonderful and refreshing news pertaining to Trigun is that it is light on the commonly exaggerated anime character tropes.Yes, the side characters can be silly, but I rarely had to suspend all disbelief in order to take particular characters seriously. In fact, the more fleshed out Vash the Stampede becomes, the less you question whatever stereotypes he may fall into.  
I briefly mentioned the soundtrack earlier and I'm ------% positive it's worth discussing again: fucking gorgeous and insanely badass! I haven't heard guitar riffs this insanely catchy in a very long time, and one particular song had me whistling for days after I finished the show in its entirety.  
Trigun is an upbeat adventure, a hilarious comedy, and a stirring drama. Definitely worth checking out.

Toradora was something I have been wanting to see done since I ever got into anime; a comedy that is realistic and funny, not needing to reach into the realms of ecchi, space and other anime craziness. Toradora was ACTUALLY funny on it's own, which was made possible by a cast with something else you don't usually get in your anime; original personality archtypes. All in all, a great surprise to me, seeing as I went into this series out of boredom expecting little from it. 
Story; -. Toradora, like all high school set anime, really doesn't have a shocking story; kids grow up. growing up sure is hard though! angst angst angst crush crush crush. And this show was no exception, however the character interactions and scenarios felt much more realistic than they are in many school series. There were not girls running underwear-clad through the halls, and no one ascended from space for the cultural festival that just happened to be full of student bunny girls. Everything that they went through in their daily motions was believable, and this allowed for fresh, entertaining humor to take place. This is the best comedic anime since Paniponi Dash easily, and this is a compliment, considering how much I loved PPD. 
Art; -. Sadly, the art was all over the place. I actually loved the character models. Taiga was perfect, Ryuji actually looked pretty cool in my opinion. Kushieda reminded me of Haruko (FLCL) in a good way, and overall the characters were all well drawn. But the art consistensy was absolutley terrible. Let's be honest here, I'm tossing Toradora in with Simoun now, because both series deserve much better art than they got, because they were both phenomenal. There were a handful of sequences that looked good, and stills too. But, especially in the shows middle, many scenes look thrown together; the climactic fight between Taiga and the Student Council President was terribly animated, which was a huge shame because they built up such great tension for it. Altogether the art is sub par, and could have been much better. Especially with JC Staff. 
Sound; -. Generic j-pop? check. Orchestra for teenage suffering? check. Terrible, cheesy synthed love themes for tender moments? check. Yeah, everything's there. Nothing special, but this could have been much worse (see: school rumble themes. jesus freakin' christ.) 
Character; -. The characters were the polish this story needed to outshine all the other titles in this genre the way it did. Taiga was an very hotheaded, and as a character she grew a ton from start to end. I really enjoyed her, and Ryuji as well. Kushieda was possibly my favorite character though, because I could relate best to her; also, the weirdness about her was entertaining and stayed within realistic boundries too, which I loved. She had hilarious careers too. Kitamura was the most badass student council member I've ever seen in anime, a good change from the expected geekiness. His antics were legitimatley entertaining, as was the hair dying segment something I've personally seen in school. And once again, the characters also work to make this feel so attainable, and that really gives it a great number of points for it's watchability. You can really get into it, and I totally dig that about it. Great characters. 
Enjoyment/Overall; -. Although the inconsistent art was annoying at times, Toradora was a very nice treat; I watched it much faster than planned, because I really wound up liking it. The great characters and ACTUAL comedy made it a really fun experience, and I absolutley reccomend this to anyone looking for good comedy. It's like a School Rumble that could actually happen.

Lacia character does her best what she can do. but impressive fighting style.  
other character like Arato's sister,,, meh....... :/ totally sucks. that the hell was that, total bullshit! -_- i've seen far better.  
i personally didnt like this anime, dropped it after -- episodes. its lack of a good story. i'd recommend you to watch it if you literally nothing to watch. you can watch it to pass your time.

Didn't intend to write a review to this one, but episode -- did it to me... 
Let's quickly go through good parts first: 
- the art is great 
- the fights are beautiful and nothing of those blurred images when you can't even see who hit who 
- the story had been a bit curious up until episode - or so, but since then it got slightly more interesting. Nothing special I'd say, but curious to observe 
And here is one bad part that is doing its best to ruin all enjoyment I get from this anime: 
- humor. It's horrible. Not just it is horrible, but it is completely out of place that makes it really awkward. I intended to ignore/accept it as inevitable up until episode --, but here anime went all in. Don't get me wrong, I love stupid jokes in anime and see characters screaming their emotions, Gintama is my fav anime after all, okay. But here it looks completely out of place, too exaggerated and so so so unnecessary. The main mood of the anime is quite serious, there are plenty of quite dark gory scenes there. And then --th episode with the humor like ""see, this guy has a snot down his nose, go on, laugh! laugh, I said!"". My jaw actually dropped when I saw this, no kidding. I simply don't understand why such humor is even there. The idea probably was to mix dark and funny parts, but honestly, plenty of other anime did it so much better. Here it is awkward and it doesn't add anything into the anime, nor in characters. Lose it and story won't change, characters won't change. These scenes here are simply poorly made as if the authors didn't actually know what exactly they wanted to achieve and how.  
Without this anime would be about -/-- so far, but that's only the middle of the season. But with such misplaced unnecessary awkward humor I'd give it -/-- I think. Again, might change with more episodes coming out.

In the year ----, and presumbaly in those that will follow it, it is now accepted by the vast majority of people that cartoons are not always for children.  
Undoubtedly there are some out there who most continue to defend their love of Chinese cartoons from parental scepticism and faced high-school mockery and social isolation, but for those of who have surpassed the need for the approval of others, but not old enough to have children to be disappointd in, it is accepted that drawn pictures are not childish by their very nature. 
This was not always so, and the changing tide of popular opinion on this matter can be attributed to several productions, primarily American Cartoons. The most well-known of course is The Simpsons, in its early days criticised for its rude content and the troubling prospect of Bart Simpson being a ""bad influence"" on children. This was merely a foot in the door however; it was not until the release of South Park some ten years later that the floodgates opened and cartoons were no longer just for lil' tykes. Now we have Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleaveland Show and a handful of other shows not created by Seth McFarlane. Of course, this is only a sweeping populist narrative that neglects a range of facts. There were in fact a number of different shows which appeared in the years between The Simpsons and South Park which also played their part, such as:  Beavis and Butthead, Ren and Stimpy, Daria, Cow and Chicken, Space Ghost Coast to Coast... and Urotsukidoji. What do you mean, you've never heard of Urotsukidoji? 
Though it has since been resigned to history, Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend has had more publicity in the West than most anime outside of the Ghibli catalogue ever will. In fact, this now forgotten film from the early --s managed to make it into the newspapers. You may not be surprised to learn that this was not to publicise this fascinating art-form from a distant land or an appraisal of its content. Instead, Urotsukidoji found its way into the newspapers because it was in defiance of a universal truth: that cartoons are, by their very nature, for children. 
At this point it is worth taking a moment out from this no doubt fascinating History lesson to put into context precisely what I mean when I say that Urotsukidoji is not suitable for children. Does it contain characters that could be considered less than wholesome? Yes, there are a few. Does it contain vulgar language, left uncensored, that may graze an otherwise innocent ear? Yes, it does. Does it contain a scene where a monster rapes a human girl with massive tentacle-like appendages? Yes, most of them. 
Make no mistake, the hard drive of even the most enthusiastic and perverse torture porn aficionado would make more suitable viewing for children. Even most adults would struggle to sit through the seriously disturbing content of this film without feeling upset. There were even times that I, despite being completely desensitised to any cartoon depiction of graphic violence at this point, considered switching the video off completely, because Urotsukidoji had simply become too disturbing. You may have guessed that this graphic content may have had something to do with its media coverage. 
Indeed it is so. Through a mixture of parental presumption, ignorance or perhaps indifference, at some point in the mid-nineties some children in the United Kingdom managed to get their hands on a copy of Urotsukidoji and watched it. And with that, the almighty Overfiend of tabloid journalism appeared, and set about making sure that our innocent little children shall never gaze upon these filthy Chinese cartoons ever again. The unfortunate thing is, having actually sat through it, one can almost sympathise with those out to censure it. The entire film is a complete mess. 
Urotsukidoji does have a storyline behind it,  perhaps even one more ambitious than other hentai, but the pacing is dire and it's not even remotely coherent. Essentially we 'ignorant humans' believe we are the masters of the world, when in fact there are three worlds and one creature which will eventually rule them all, the titular Overfiend. This raises a lot of questions about how these worlds are related to each other, how to travel between them  and many other questions. Unfortunately there is little we 'ignorant humans' can do about this, because the film never bothers to explain this clearly. At one point Amano, the half-beast assigned to the task of searching for the Chojin, brings several characters through some kind of dimensional warp to the dimension of the man-beasts, but it's never made clear how this works or whether other creatures can use it. Alas, we are merely ""ignorant humans"". 
The question of who the Chojin's host will be is another mystery. There are two contenders, the wimpy pervert and the athletic (later reformed) sex addict. The criteria for what makes someone a Chojin is that they are able to ""drive the ladies wild"". Don't worry, you're not alone- I'm also worried I may be a Chojin too. The test to find out is simple; you need to have sex with a woman. Oops, watch out for that plot hole! 
If you are outraged that you are not the demon creature that will be tasked with fucking the world to destruction, then do not worry, there is another option available to you: become the anti-Chojin. How do you do that? You just fuck some tube that some demons will bring you. Once you're done, simply find the Chojin and consume his blood and semen to complete the transformation. Yes. 
One could spend a day picking apart the problems with the plot in Urotsukidoji, but perhaps the most telling thing about the quality of story is that I feel like I have described almost the entire story of the film, yet have not gone beyond the confines of the blurb. This indicates both how thin the story is, and just how abysmal the pacing is. Then again, a shorter film or better plot would have meant less time spent on watching demon rape. Some might say that isn't a huge loss, but as connoissuers of rapey demons will testify, Urotsukidoji has the best animated demon rape money can buy, or that internet can download! 
Perhaps it is because this film stands so tenuously between the boundaries of 'bizarre artwork' and 'disturbing pornography' that so much effort was put into the animation of Urotsukidoji. Or maybe because the perverts who drew it were so desperate for it to be made into a reality they were willing to work for free. We ""ignorant humans"" will never know the truth, but you could be surprised by the quality of the artwork. The human character designs are quite ugly (especially the female characters, oddly enough) but the demon creatures who rape them look fantastic. The backgrounds are nicely detailed if awash in dark colours, and the animation is faultless. 
Urotsukidoji is yet another step on the Central Park Media grand tour of badly dubbed anime, but unfortunately it is not a memorable one. While there a few ridiculous lines like ""let me see that Chojin dick!"" and a few others about intercourse and its many instruments, the acting is mainly just mediocre and the script is mainly just dull. Very dull indeed. In fact once you get beyond the shock-factor, it summarises the whole film rather nicely: dull. 
As I said already, Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend is a film that has been resigned to history, and that is definitely not without good reason. Be content with your human ignorance.

This anime had potential to me...it had an awesome opening, the main man in my opinion was amazing...his powers amazing, the background stories, the stories the antagonists the ART oh how I loved the art....but what made me drop the series was that...they talked...way...too...much. 
They walked and the fight scenes would be like - minute an -- seconds long. I  DARE YOU to time them...they maybe less...and sadly that was the only reason. I couldn't bear it.  
It's not even the fact that it lacked action...they just literally talked too much, so without beating this already dead horse. I would not recommend this anime. I don't even feel inclined to read this manga..

Those who are weak die. That is a saying among villains and other less-than-desirable characters in many forms of entertainment. That is, until they are presented the error in their ways and are defeated once and for all. When it comes to Devilman Crybaby, the closest thing I can say while avoiding any spoilers is... not so fast. This review focuses solely on Devilman Crybaby. I have not seen any other Devilman titles.  
Devilman Crybaby is an interesting take on a complicated war between humans and demons. I can appreciate the fact that it takes a dramatic turn rather quickly, so it was easy to get hooked on the show early. The animation is certainly not good, but it is still passable and I eventually came to appreciate it. The music is great and stayed that way.  
Ultimately what makes the show good is how it develops about halfway into the ---episode series. On the surface it makes you think: Devils are bad. Guy becomes half-devil. Guy kills devils and wins. But it's nice to see that things actually get pretty complicated. The existence of devils shoves the entire planet into a hyper-intensified version of the red scare, where mass hysteria turns the entire population into Philadelphia Eagles fans. From this it became hard to identify what is right, and what motivates different groups at play. What made this enjoyable was there was no telling what was going to happen except a firm belief that it wasn't going to end well.  
That being said, I think the story took too long to develop. The first and second halves feel like two completely different shows. My least favorite part of it all is I think it became so violent to the point that it was senseless gore porn. Some of the fights were critical to the story and I understand that it gives the gritty feel that a show like Devilman should have, but I will reiterate that I think they just went too far with it. I also think their excessive use of nudity, especially in the first few episodes, was unnecessary. There is an entire genre of TNA for people who want that, but I don't like it in shows that focus on a dark and serious story. Did I mention that the show is violent? 
Overall, -/-- is a fitting score for me when it comes to Devilman Crybaby. I certainly enjoyed it but I also have my issues with it. Reboots or re-imagined stories have a difficult time surviving in the anime world, and even though I never saw the originals I believe Crybaby was a good one. I would have liked to have seen it be maybe a little longer with a more satisfying ending, but for what it is it fits the -/-- title of ""fine"". Not bad, but not particularly great, either.

If your looking for a comedy/ecchi title, look no futher. Golden Boy is most certainly a masterpiece. The animation is old skool animation no cgi crap these days. The coloring, shading, transitions are perfect. The story is not a complex story that can get you confused or question what's going on. Its a clear cut story that is original and unique. Character development is great for an ova series with only - episodes, and you can watch this over and over again. I cannot count how many times i cried because of how hilarious this title is. The ecchi only makes it even funnier too. This is without a doubt one of the best anime titles and out there and I most certainly recommend you buy this on dvd for your personal collection. Great job Mr. Tatsuya Egawa and Hiroyuki Kitakubo!

In two short minutes of animation, ""Egao"" tells a short love story that begins with heart-wrenching melancholy and ends with head-scratching confusion. I suppose Makoto Shinkai has always been a master at manipulating emotion.  
Egao certainly does not evoke this confusion through deep or complex storytelling, however; it falls very much on the opposite side of the spectrum. The problem, rather, is that Shinkai just does not say or do much of anything with it. The story starts on a happy note, the unnamed protagonist enjoying the company of her new hamster, and then it decides to suddenly turn things into a story of unrequited love-- Shinkai's trademark, the same theme that has been present in his stories from the beginning and likely until the day he retires from animation.  
To be fair, watching Egao without being able to understand the lyrics would be something of a disservice, as the lyrics are half the story, and, if a bit trite (how many times have we heard Japanese people sing and praise the beauty of the blue sky?), the most emotionally evocative aspect of the anime. The lyrics make it clear that it is not a story about the hamster, but rather about the protagonist being separated from her lover and, by the end, resolving herself to ""never give up"" again, seemingly ready to give another go with whoever it is she's thinking about.  
But so what? Why are we supposed to care? We have no idea why she even decided to change her mind in the first place. It's unreasonable to expect deep characters and storytelling from a two-minute music video, but the least it could have done is use its visuals to detail the protagonist in a deeper way than ""I'm sad-- now I'm happy"". It comes from nowhere, with her crying in bed and reminiscing about her lover, and somehow ending with a smile on her face despite nothing actually happening. I suppose the hamster lifted her spirits? Or maybe she's just an emotionally unstable and perhaps bipolar person who switches from extreme depression to happiness with the snap of a finger? Your guess is as good as mine.  
Even with the song itself being as emotional as it is, it's hard to come away with the feeling that Shinkai was actually trying to say anything of importance with this animation. There's nothing to think about, nothing to consider by the end-- it's just two minutes of nothingness with a sad song playing in the background. It could have been something more if it decided to ditch the whole unrequited love theme and focus solely on the company of the hamster, as a way perhaps of encouraging the audience to appreciate the simple things in life. But there is nothing of the sort here. Not even close. It is an admittedly talented artist playing masturbation, content with just being his usual self rather than saying something to his audience. And that's fine to an extent (maybe his friends enjoyed it or something), but the world of criticism isn't always so forgiving. 
Still, it's nice to see the talent of the industry attempting to tell simple, emotional stories with less tools than the typical film or TV series, even if it doesn't always work out so well.  
Maybe I'm just silly for expecting quality storytelling from a music video. Hm. 
At least the hamster was cute.

Whoa I have just ended up watching one of the best anime a real masterpiece. Talking about various points the most important aspect of any thing you watch is story and Monster really has a very strong story line that engages you till the very last episode. Wonderful characters, good background score, more than decent animation. It is a, having everything kind of anime. Monster is a very engaging anime despite its slow start it unfolds each chapter with a junction of curiosity of what will follow. To be frank if you watch this anime without knowing the plot you would end up enjoying this anime even more. Moreover it is a mystery, psychological anime it can be depressing at times and contains a couple of nude scenes though nothing in particular. Don't miss this one please I'm sure you will not end up in regret for watching this -- episode thrilling anime.

Oh god I hate this anime, the game was refreshing but the anime... 
You can't talk about it without being seriously enraged. I didn't really care about Key's works before, but this time I had to react. Let's start with the characters: they're all a bunch of stereotypes patchworks from the previous Key's works. I didn't find any girls interesting except for Mio and Rin. Mio's arc from the season - was the best one in my opinion, Kud's arc was the worst piece of shit ever. 
The music was inspired by Wii Sports it seems, it didn't really bring me any sadness or whatever, and the comedy-performance was really poor. I swear, I've never seen worse except for Clannad. And the story in general was very poorly written, this is really a generic harem except for some artificial extensions like baseball which brings this to a sport anime.  
Let's talk about the few arcs, the first one was about Komari. I really find the concept interesting, but in the end you get the loli's artificial crying and it made me fucking angry. 
I remember the pink haired twins being probably the worst after Kud. And the pseudo-vice-president or whatever was playing tsundere so bad that it makes Haruhi Susumiya looks like a god. Mio's arc was really a piece of art, this character was credible because she reminded me of myself, the stuff about the self-preservation, the cultivation books and of course the yaoi was the best part. 
Something really sucks about this show and would be the main-protagonist Riki: he's supposed to build a harem, but in your mind you'll think he's a girl (his voice is the most girly compared to the others girls); this is truly laughable. Of course the others guys are the essential factors for developing his ""virility"". Good luck in whatever they are doing!

While the concept for this show sounds generic and over done, it appealed to me as something that could be enjoyable. Something I could sit down and mindlessly appreciate after a hard long day. This however was not the case, and I would have to be more than just mindless to even enjoy a scrape of this absolute faeces of a show.  
Everything about this show reeks of amateurism. It's bland, it's boring, and it gives us everything we hated about every other isekai and nothing that we loved. The male protagonist who was bullied and is out for revenge, but somehow lost any personality he had along the way. His love interest; the loli girl who is a million years old so hot damn, it's ""okay"" if they kiss - she's definitely legal. And let's not forget the disgusting CGI. Action scenes can often save a poorly written show, making up for the terrible dialogue and half-assed attempt at character growth. But for Arifureta, it only adds to the long list of detriments.  
Nothing Hajime does is revolutionary. Nothing he does is even vaguely interesting, actually. He trains, he grows. But who is he? We only find out during badly timed and frankly unseemly flashbacks. We have no reason to care about this person because his only known trait, which isn't a positive, is that he was betrayed by a classmate. I think I'd prefer it if he were at least insufferable. If he at least made me feel some sort of emotion. In a show where the art, animation, and vile GCI are just some of the downfalls, the protagonist really needed to carry the show. But he lacks in pretty much every aspect and fails to even keep us glued for one episode. 
Yue is the same. She's a cliche loli/vampire and provides absolutely no value. I'm a firm believer that a good show will utilise a few cliches; they're used often for a reason. However this is one that isn't quite necessary. Telling us she's ---- years old doesn't make us feel any less creeped out when she sucks blood from Hajime's neck. It certainly doesn't make their kissing scene less creepy, either. Fuelling the fantasy's of a certain set of people is lovely fan service but it's not quite what I'm looking for. 
All in all, this show is pure garbage. Badly written, badly directed. Poor transitions early on when dealing with past/present scenes make it hard to watch, and action scenes that look like they were animated during the --s only make it worse. Put the icing of dull, unlikeable characters onto the metaphorical cake and we have one of the worst shows of ----.

*****No Spoilers Included****** 
In all my years of watching anime, I have never given any reviews, but after watching this show I couldn't help but to write one. 
In my opinion, this anime is definitely the best show in the school, slice of life and psycological genre till date. It's been a while since an anime has stepped out of the ""herd"" of the generic mass produced shows with empty plots and hollow character development. 
Hikigaya Hachiman and Yukinoshita Yukino are by far the best anime characters made till date.  
I personally feel that this show is extremely underrated and should atleast be in the top -- although i do understand that this show will not be enjoyed equally by everyone due to its realistic and calm nature unlike some of its counterparts present this season which has a lot of high tech ""-D"" action (you know what i'm talking about). This show definitely falls under the seinen genre so i can understand the lack of popularity.  
Also, I believe that this show is being misunderstood by some people as a love triangle perhaps due to the picture depicting to girls and one guy, but I can assure you, its not even close. 
I won't go into any details regarding the characters and the story since it ruins the excitement but i can assure you that this anime is something that should not be missed.

Sometimes, I wish I could wipe my own memory and relive the experience of something all over again. Whether it’s a book, manga, video game, TV show, or anime, there’s probably one thing out there we all want to experience all over again for the first time. Mob Psycho --- Season - is one of those things.  
With its ever growing popularity, ONE's Mob Psycho --- is back in town with its eccentric character cast and innovative ideas. It’s hard not to love the show with its sheer dynamic visual style. But we know Mob Psycho is much more than its animation quality. In fact, this is one of the few show that fully manages to capture the magic of the manga and perhaps outdone itself even more. Mob’s return reminds me how an underdog young boy like him can make a difference in a world where anything is possible.  
As one of the most anticipated sequels, Mob Psycho Season - immediately gets the viewers back on track starting from the first episode. It’s not in a huge rush to accelerate the plot like some sequels but instead get fans to familiarize the franchise again. We are reminded of how characters can change and make a difference with Mob being the most prominent example this season. He’s no longer a shy little kid like before and stands up for himself. Mob is like capeless hero armed with esper power and a strong desire to be himself in this season. Regardless who he is facing off against, he doesn’t back down and shows just how much he has grown. Now, that my friends, is more than just hitting puberty. On the other hand, we are also reintroduced to Reigen, the sexy bad boy who is known for being super shady. Business returns for him and he isn’t afraid to guide Mob with his way of words. In the earlier episodes, the duo deals with urban legends and eventually, he even decides to make a website for psychic business. With this business, it should come to no surprise that he’d attract unwanted attention. Knowing Reigen, he deals with his problems in unorthodox ways with a full air of confidence regardless of consequences. The season boosts his personality in full fold with him taking on the role of a businessman, a con artist, and anti-hero. Regardless how the show delivers his character, I always find him to be the most entertaining part of this season. Why? It’s because of how much variety Reigen brings out of this show. Mob Psycho shines when characters’ actions speaks louder than words, and in most cases, Reigen does so. It’s the type of fan service where ONE knows how to give to us, the audience. 
As part of the plot, the first half felt like the storytelling is a bit loose although remains consistent to the show’s overall themes. When experimenting with ideas, Mob Psycho always wants us to feel something whether it’s sadness, laughter, or excitement. Indeed, there’s a deeper degree of emotions drawn out with the attitude and actions of the characters this season. Mob is an example of such when he became a much larger than life character. He wants to improve himself and continues to overcome his own personal obstacles. It makes me want to see him succeed and the show executes Mob’s character growth emotionally. I’m not going to lie, this season might just make one of you shed a tear or two.  
You could probably guess that while the second season contains its goofy moments, we can’t forget about the threats of certain espers. In the latter of the show, we are introduced to Claw, an organization that wants to make the world under its image. Is the world ready? Can anyone stop them? If you’re not aware, ONE is also known for his other popular superhero work, One Punch Man. This show no doubt has its own legion of heroes only that they aren't dubbed as such but act with heroic intentions. Even Reigen, our local bad boy knows who the real villains are despite his reputation. Claw itself is a mysterious organization especially with their charismatic leader, Toichiro Suzuki. As a very powerful esper, his own confidence perhaps dwarves even Reigen. After announcing his plan for a New World Order, he makes it clear that nothing will get in his way. The second season pushes him as the Big Bad along with the Ultimate -, a series of elite espers who serves directly under their boss. If you don’t believe me, just watch what characters like Shimazuki and Mingeishi can really do. They test the limits of Espers’ powers with few rivals. But still, I don’t think Mob Psycho was ever designed to be a battle shounen. It’s more of an supernatural action flick that combines elements of its unique humor, style, and surreal imaginations to make a worthy show. And trust me, what I came to see is what I got from this season. 
Bones, what can we do without you? With so many action packed projects under your belt, Mob Psycho really is another title that fully deserved its spot on their roster. Make no mistake, the second season is a feast of extravagant animation that went beyond my expectations. In particular, chief animation director Yoshimichi Kameda is able to sell the character designs as real as possible while decorating the show with jaw-breaking elements. Episode - is an example with the extensive amount of stylistic choreography. It may look a bit rough at times but the episode delivered the highest quality of anime action I haven’t seen in years. When the show isn’t showing off its over the top tier animation, it’s well known to execute its character personality through cleverly timed expressions. There’s no shortage of moments this season when you find characters react in overly exaggerated manners. It’s the type of selling that makes Mob Psycho --- Season - so great. 
It’s been a wild ride this season. With just -- episodes, Mob Psycho’s sequel manages once again become a sensation from Studio Bones and its talented staff. There was no episode where I felt bored as it managed to connect me with its wealth of creative ideas and character growth. Very few shows I’ve seen these days can match up with the style that Mob Psycho has built and to say this without bias is a real accomplishment. Keep up the good work Mob Psycho, because you definitely earned it.

The movie is so great and heartwarming. Very well written high school drama, with usual high school tropes but with a refreshing twist. I really like the movie, i give it -/--. minus - because the art is a bit generic for my taste. all in all, base on story, --/--, it has a refreshing take on the usual high school-teen-drama story with a lot of heart, will definitely make you laugh and cry in one movie, there is a bit of musical/singing part to the movie which for me makes it even great.  character development is great as well, especially with the four leading roles. the supporting characters has a great charm in it that makes the whole story wonderful.

Recovery of an MMO Junkie would benefit greatly if it didnt repeat the exact same joke over and over again and didnt make the characters get over the same problem multiple times. 
It should also stop placing Koiwai in the story to move the plot along and actually make the characters go after each other which is what the shows implies will happen but never does and finally, it could implant Sakurai a personality so he stops being such a Plain Jane. 
This anime has also hit the - Deus-Ex Machina Strikes of stopping the characters of making a big move or learning a new vital piece of information by way of an external influence such as the classic ""Loud noise prevents a characters love confession"" and the equally infamous ""Characters who are about to kiss get interrupted"".  
Even if the latter is not as tragic since by that point we know that the characters have strong feelings for each other it nevertheless makes the viewer feel disgruntled and disappointed. 
Recovery of an MMO Junkie had a decent amount of potencial to become a short but good romance story --or at least thats what the lenght of the first season (-- episodes) seems to be trying to do. At any rate, I think it would be best to give Signal.MD the benefit of the doubt since - OVA specials have been announced as soon as the anime stopped airing so my criteria could be subject to change.

I really don't know why it took me so long to start this anime, or for that matter, why it took me so long to finish it. Its a classic that has to watched by everyone. expectantly boxing fans like me. 
The first episode had a unique feel to it but it was still just a simple bullied kid that wanted to stop the bullying. Nothing special. But as soon as those leaves were grasped, the show took off, spiraling into a heartfelt boxing banana. Ippo really had a way of just making you want him to be good at whatever he did, giving this anime another hook to its already thrilling boxing draw.The side main characters really have a way of playing with you as well, like they make you want to hate them for what they do, but at the same time, its so hard to turn away from their funny and ghastly humor. I feel that they added very detailed backstories for these characters very late in the anime and it really bothered me. I'm not sure why it did, but it just didn't feel right that they only had their spotlight -- some episodes in, where the creators easily could've but more of a back story into the other characters that came up. 
The art was mediocre, really had its feel to the whole thing but still made it hard to deal with at time. They took little Ippo who looked like he barely hit the --- pound mark, and turned him into someone who looked like he could've been straight out of a marvel comic, huge muscles and giant build, aswell as the tiny head that made it look even weirder. Another struggle I had was the noses. I think Ippo went through atleast -- plastic surgeries through this anime, as his nose NEVER looked the same between episodes, nor did most other characters' noses. 
The theme songs were terrible. Both outros and the second intro was a major turn off. The only one that I actually liked was the first intro because it flowed with the images it was using as the intro video. 
My overall enjoyment of the anime was definatlly above and beyond most other animes for the simple fact that it kept true to its boxing crucantail, only letting in a little bit of drama here and there, Ippo had his little romance every couple episodes, and the random bs had its fill, but it NEVER iterfiered with the main goal of the anime! BOXING! Because of this fact, it is defienly a high reccomandation for anyone, not only boxers, who wants an anime that actually stays true to its opening story! 
My overall rating of this anime -/-- but I still think it is a must watch to any and all, due to its pure beauty of being an anime that stays true to what it wants to do!

**THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS** 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE:  
-Cheesy --s action 
-Episodic series 
-Saturday morning cartoon level of plausibility. 
then this is not for you.  
-If you're looking for a coherent prequel that connects the stories of ""Casshern Sins"" & ""Casshan Robot Hunter""  
Look somewhere else.  
But if you'll like to see the -st time these characters were all brought together then keep on reading. 
To say that Shinzou Ningen Casshern ( or Neo Human Casshan) is an overlooked title is a understatement. The very fact that there's only - review for this show on MAL and sometimes no episode discussions should already say enough. But even more surprising is that this title, which has been covered up by the passage of time, has a relatively successful reboot called Casshern Sins. And for those reading this review, Casshern Sins is more than likely the only reason you're here to begin with. However is it a bad thing that SNC is a title that not even retro anime fans discuss? Well..... not really, as SNC falls victim to one of the main reasons these relics of anime's past are lost and forgotten, and that's because it's outdated.  
From the time SNC was conceived to now, many other anime titles came along and took it's concepts and greatly improved on it. From the questions brought up regarding android and human integration, to the post apocalyptic setting, everything SNC tried to tackle has been better explored and refined to better effect. So when it boils down to it, the real reason for watching this isn't for any pioneering idea or to see a show that ""revolutionize""  the industry but rather to see the humble beginnings of Casshern Sins. 
Story: -/-- 
The story is straight forward and one you've undoubtedly seen countless of times: Save the world from the great evil that wants to take it over. 
We follow Tetsuya who is the son of a great scientist named Dr. Azuma. Dr. Azuma is well known for his robot creations, which he makes to better human lives. However after a freak accident, one of his robots named BK-- became self-aware after being struck by lightening. This robot renamed himself Braiking Boss and waged a full on assault against mankind. 
Backed against a wall the only option left to combat Braiking Boss was to turn Dr. Azuma's son Tetsuya into a powerful android. And so Casshern was born.  
NOW In order to enjoy this show you need to suspend your disbelief, since the episodic stories can range from somewhat plausible to plain ludicrous. You can go from a straight forward fight against robots to something obscure like puppies seeking revenge. Because of this the tone of SNC is all over the place. Despite the inconsistency, the show still tries to be serious, which in turn makes it rather comical or painful to watch depending on your mindset. With no consistency between the episodic structure, it feels like there's a lack of progression. Being episodic isn't necessarily a bad thing, but with little to no variation to the plot it feels like you're watching the same setup over and over again. The episodes seem to always run along the lines of: A city becomes under-attack by the Android army, Casshan steps in to fight them, android army retreats, rinse and repeat.  It takes -- episodes for an actual plot to take place and even then it's still in an episodic format. You can literally watch the -st - episodes, watch episode --, then last - episodes and you won't miss anything. And the final nail in the proverbial coffin is that SNC have an anticlimactic conclusion, which is unsatisfying to say the least. 
Art/Animation: -/-- 
If there's one area that SNC can be respected  in is its animation. As some of the action sequences are on par with the -st Mobile Suit Gundam, despite it being made years ahead of it in --. But it still falls behind similar super hero shows like Hurrican Polmar which was made in -- and showed greater fluidity and aesthetics. This places SNC above expected standards, making it above average for it's time. With that said the show has aged well given that it's --+ years old. You can tell they placed alot of effort into Casshern's acrobatics and combat sequences as it can be impressive when the time calls for it. The color pallet presented were a trademark of the --s with brightly colored robot designs and nicely textured backgrounds.  
The character designs had very nice features, note worthy designs being the variation of robot baddies, from the endless drones to the occasional special bots.  
Where the animation falls short is it's excessive use of still shots and reused footage which becomes apparent very fast. Also when there isn't any action going on, the animation becomes extremely stiff. However this inconsistency is to be expected given the time period it was made. 
Also expect explosions, lots and lots of explosions. As it seems like every fodder robot is made of TNT and flimsy parts that blow up just for the sake of blowing up. 
Sound: -/-- 
There's very little to say regarding the soundtrack and sound effects of SNC. There's only a instrumental of the opening played during fights and less than a handful tracks played throughout the series with very little variation. The opening however is unbelievably cheesy and will surely bring a chuckle, just try not to laugh when the singer yells ""FRIENDER JETTTTT!"" 
The voice actors all fit their roles well, most notably Braiking Boss for sounding menacing and childish. 
Characters: -/-- 
Casshan, our protagonist is your ""fight for whats right"" MC. He's very one note and fits the respective archetype fairly well. There isn't much layer characterization but that is sufficed with moments where he has internal strife regarding his position as an android/human hybrid. Unfortunately this topic is never fully explored but rather skimmed over.  
Luna, his childhood friend, is simply treated like a sidekick. Very little screentine is given to develop her. However she is never relegated to being a damsel in distress and holds her own in a fight which makes her a welcomed addition. She also provides moral support for Casshan when needed. 
Braiking Boss,  our main antagonist, is your typical Saturday morning cartoon brand of villain. He's evil solely for the sake of being evil. This caricature depiction is further escalated when he's portrayed as a tyrannical ruler. 
It can also be speculated that they took the inspiration from the Stalin era and Khrushchev era of the Soviet Union as well as Adolf Hitler's radical idealism as inspiration for Braiking Boss's characteristics. May this be a direct social commentary or just the creators trying to make a really - sided villain, its up for you to decide. 
All the other supporting characters are not worth the mention due to the episodic structure. But they're given enough time to have a sense purpose. The robots all seem incompetent however, as they fall for petty tricks 
and are easily outwitted. This in turn makes it hard to take their presence seriously. 
The biggest problem with these characters is that they remain stagnant.They never show any sign of development nor do they receive extra characterization during the -- episode runtime.  
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Despite this show's numerable problems I found moments of enjoyment while watching. It's easy to see the love and effort the creators placed in it and because of it's ridiculous stories it made for good B-Movie entertainment.  
Overall: -.-/-- 
Even disregarding superficial things like animation and sound, SNC is a fundamentally flawed show in many ways. It tries to be taken seriously but is too nonsensical and juvenile to allow the viewer proper immersion. It was onto something but didn't quite live up to it's own ambitious goal.  
Unless you're a hardcore Casshern Sins fan or like retro B-Movie entertainment this title isn't a necessary watch. If you're not interested after - episodes in then the rest of it will do nothing to impress you.

TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers. 
""I've come to realize that emotions aren't something you learn – they have to be experienced."" —Gourai 
Frame Arms Girl (F.A. Girl) is a show that had potential to be something great, but unfortunately fell short. 
Ao Gennai receives a package from her father one day, which it's contents are revealed to be Gourai, a Frame Arms Girl. From here, their friendship grows as Ao teaches Gourai the variety of emotions humans feel. Along the way, they meet many friends and foes alike. 
This story and setting had vast potential to be something so beautiful, but it ended up turning out poorly. Not only is writing fairly subpar, all the characters are really flat (in more ways than one). They each have the unique trait (Gourai is a hard worker, Jinrai is way too into ninjas, Base is childish, Materia twins are cunning and suggestive, etc etc) but it doesn't go any farther than that, with the exception of Ao and Gourai. The show is based around these two and their relationship, but it really feels like you're just watching a small robot learn to express emotion, which is pretty bland most of the time. 
F.A. Girl constantly switched between -D and -D aspects, along with showing a lot of -.-D shots. This worked for and against it, with the majority being against, unfortunately. Every now and then, they'd have a well animated scene (some fight scenes, like Ao / Jinrai vs. the Materia twins), but then other times it just felt awkward and out-of-sync (the finale live show in the last episode).  As for the soundtrack, there's nothing really going for or against it. Both the OP and ED aren't awful, but there are plenty of other better ones.  
TL;DR: F.A. Girl had the potential to be a great show, but didn't quite make it by a rather large margin. While there were some nice scenes and times where the show was enjoyable, you wouldn't miss out on anything should you choose not to watch.

One Piece is honestly the most amazing series I have ever watched or read.  The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest.  The characters are some of the most endearing, well-developed and likable characters and the art, while not appealing to me at first, took a grand total of TWO episodes to get used to before I found it to be incredibly unique and my favorite anime art style to date. 
While this series has serious moments, it never stops being funny.  Something important about the humor in this series is that it's ORIGINAL.  None of the typical jokes that are recycled in every anime and even the serious moments I was talking about are sprinkled with clever and endearing humor that keeps me watching. 
Something that is important to me in a series is the characters.  If I don't like characters, chances are, I'm not going to like the series.  The lead cast to One Piece has won me over in their own individual ways.  There is not a single one I don't like and I seriously thought that was IMPOSSIBLE. 
I could go on and on about this series but it's not my job to tell you EVERYTHING great about it!  Just take my word on it!

I've played both of the DMMD games, and the game series alone is fabulous. I stopped watching the anime mid-way because I didn't want my love of the games to be soiled by an anime adaption that basically gave an episode per character and stripped them down of most of their characteristics. The animation was sometimes laughably bad, but hey what do you expect. I've mainly given up on BL game anime adaptions (Togainu no Chi, and now this), since I feel like they never have the budget they really deserve to actually make it good. If you're new to DMMD and like the general gist of it, I'd highly recommend you play the games (though beware they are quite graphic, especially compared to this anime). I think the only reason I gave this series a ""decent"" rating was that I actually knew what was going on since I played the first game before watching the series. Otherwise i'd be so clueless.

And here I am, writing for the first time a review on this amazing site. 
Well, ok, OniAi. Let's talk about this anime, a cringeworthy, so predictable, trashy and unfunny anime. Yes, I'm honestly saying that I almost hated this anime, thinking it was just a funny anime with an incest background like Oreimo, but I was expecting too much. 
Ok, first of all, let's start with the story. (there will be possibly spoilers of the first episode only) 
We have this girl, Himenokoji Akito, that after years of not seeing his brother, Himenokoji Akito, she finally reunite with him. They live togheter under the same roof, they go to the same school together, shit like that, ok. But the fun fact is that Akiko, the sister, has an incestuous complex with her brother. But her brother doesn't care anymore, he's just, y'know, she loves her as a sister, she must protect her, bla bla bla. So yeah, we have this anime, with this annoying girl that this Akiko is, trying to flirting her brother, to have sex with him/marry him, in short, I N C E S T. And also in the first episode, we also have OTHER AMAZING CHARACTERS! EXACTLY, A HAREM WITH OTHER - GIRLS (and not only) TIPS FROM NOTHING. 
I gave to the story a -, because y'know it's just a simple slice of life anime (one of my favourites genres in anime to be honest), but it's filled with so many ecchi scenes (yep, those ecchi anime scenes that I don't see since Sora no Otoshimono, that it's actually better), so many things I didn't understand because the anime didn't explain it very well - expecially the fucking ending, that made me fucking cry for anger, BECAUSE IT'S SO STUPID - and also, the main thing: it's not funny, for me at least. I literally felt embarassed every minute, in every scene I saw. I actually laugh in anime like this, but this anime didn't make laugh at all. It's so ridicolous, predictable, and already seen. 
For the art I gave it a - because honestly, they did a pretty good job. Nothing else to say. 
The sound, yea, the opening is fine (nah) and I didn't listen to the ending because who fucking cares (at least for me for this anime). 
The characters, aaah, the characters. So predictable, unfunny, cringeworthy, stupid, and so on. 
Let's see what we have.. hmmm.. 
The little and cute sister, a crazy and autistic girl to be honest. She didn't see his brother since long time and she went just crazy. Literally, C R A Z Y. 
The stupid fucking brother, a light novel writer, and guess what? (spoilers, probably, don't read these words) He writes incestuous light novels, based on his real sister and him. Oh god. 
The apathetical tsundere. 
The.. pirate? Samurai? Girl with an eye patch? I don't fucking know, probably she's autistic too. 
The childhood friend. 
The loli. 
The editor of the amazing Brother. (I don't know, I honestly liked only this character, It's neutral, beside these ones). 
I will let you imagine how I enjoyed watching this anime. 
Overall, I gave this anime a straight up -. Didn't enjoy watching it. I actually do enjoy lots of anime I watch, with the most simple plots too, but this anime is an exception. If you wanna watch this anime for having just a few laughs (you won't) or at least wasting your time, do it, you'll lose all your precious time, when you can rather watch some good anime, with ok, a simple plot? But definitely better than this.

This anime was amazing. All through these twelve episodes, you learn so much about the darkness of humanity. This series has a bit of feels in it as well. The one thing i have to say is Madhouse did a great job with the ending 
The story is about Decim who runs a bar for dead people. Decims job is to judge people coming in 
Story: 
the plot is really good and original. It takes you through the different side of humanity. to see whats right and whats wrong. It takes you through an amazing experience. This series can be episodic in a good way. Every episode is original. 
Art: 
The art style is great. There is something about this art style that is really unique 
Sound: 
Music is really great and intense 
Characters: 
The characters were really devolved properly. I really enjoyed the characters. they were all really unique 
Enjoyment:  
Really enjoyed this one from start to finish. Every single episode was entertaining.  
It was a really outstanding series. Really hope for a season - but its madhouse so probably will not be one 
(im new to this so....)

Animation looks dated and characters aren't well designed, it's the equivalent of runescape in terms of an MMO style.  
First episode introduces bland characters with bad humor, literally a gender change in the first -- minutes to a more annoying character whose only purpose is to conflict.  
Shiroe isn't actually socially awkward he's more of a confident leader with a pair of glasses, not sure why wikipedia described him as that, he's pretty one dimensional. 
I read they ended up in the game by an update glitch (magic). NOBODY in the series really cares about that part more than they care about the taste of food.

Listen, all I have to say is I've never been one to be like: ""hnng anime boy this. Hnnng anime boy that."" But I swear to god Shinya Kogami is the hottest piece of anime ass I have ever seen. I found myself cheering for him constantly. Sometimes the philosophical discussions of what makes a human ""good"" versus ""evil"" completely would blow over my head. Because I'd be looking at him. Swoon. --/-- he is my best boy.  
To be more serious though, I enjoyed every second of this anime! It's really good.  I liked most of the characters (especially the main villain. And Kogami, obviously) and the storyline was fun to follow. I find it hard to finish things I watch that are over -- episodes, but I went completely through this one! Kept me there the whole time.  
In conclusion: it's good! I'd recommend it a ton.

Do you want to get cancer? Do you like the idea of forced drama every episode? Do you just not care if the characters are enjoyable? Yes, yes yes! 
Lets get on the serious sides here. This anime is pure DRAMA. ""Oh bob didnt say hi to you? Something must be up and it's my fault~~waa,waa, waa*** lets spend - episodes on it!!!"" That's basically the jist of the story alright.  
About the characters 
The main female has a running joke on her. It's that she's super ""scary"" and a ""ghost"" 
Yikes it was 'funny' at first but my god it will annoy you by the -rd episode.  
Then you have the edgy characters and the dense male. By ""edgy"" I mean the girls who will hang out with her because no one else will. Boy do those two cause problem for the series. If they dont say hi to the main character she'll go crazy and it will take - episodes just to make it clear that everything was alright and im not even kidding you this goes on for every episode it seems.  
Overall 
Attack me if you will for only watching - episodes and judging it, but it really is unbearable. With it being -- episodes I just have to warn my people.  
Summary: 
- Slow paced ( holy crap it's been - episodes? it felt like an eternity)  
- Average animation  
- Cringe worthy characters 
- At least the main character has a quirk 
- Drama Drama Drama 
- Constant crying 
- Average romance ( this doesnt bother me personally)

This is not an anime about Not Nazis or magical girls. 
This is an anime about a salaryman with upper level management written all over him pissing off the ultimate HR manager, a god, and winding up as a Magical Girl fighting alongside Not Nazis as punishment. 
If you've worked with asshole managers, supervisors, directors, etc. this will be all too familiar. You get promoted to positions you don't want, or can't handle. You want a transfer, you wind up the LAST place you want to be. There are people working against you because they hate you (in this case it's justified) or just because they're inept. 
You've worked for or with people like these. This is an anime about being a salaryman, but with a really weird setting. There's also no humor, but Japanese don't seem to laugh at the absurdity of employment like we do with Office Space. 
Not really sure where they're going with the premise, since it seems to be ""penance and redemption"" but the setting is so absurd I'm not sure what kind of penance and redemption you can achieve by fighting alongside Not Nazis.

im not good at writing reviews, but just wanted to share my thoughts on this series. 
I absolutely love it and the second season especially is a masterpiece imo, the art style was strange at first, but quickly got used to it and it is used in fantastic ways to emphasise the emotions of each scene with the use of colors, exaggerated imagery, surrealistic elements and backgrounds. 
I can't stress enough how well it's used for both comedy and heavy scenes with equal expertise. 
It goes without saying that the sound is equally amazing. 
The sound and visuals are able to propagate the tension of each battle and the emotions of each character as if you were part of the story. 
What made this season so outstanding imo were the characters and the themes of their stories, even what would seem the most forgettable characters like Junkei Yamazaki has his own backstory that's treated so well it sticks to you. 
It manages to touch a variety of themes from the heavy ones to more lightheaded ones in an organic way jumping from character to character and their arcs while never feeling boring or overdone. 
Must watch.

Exactly what it says on the title, the theme of this anime is about Corruption done by “The Money” in modern times for “Soul and Possibility Control” of the ignorant masses to turn them into mindless animalistic puppets to be toyed with by the government and businesses.  
That is probably a stretch and a bad joke.  
As interesting as the theme is, it is looked from a foolish naive perspective through the main lead Kimimaro Yoga, a member of the ignorant masses. 
There are spoilers so read at your own risk.  
Our main lead is an over-used archetype, present in the majority of anime titles aimed for youths, which is designed to “relate” his entire life to the majority of the lives of its audience. He is an average student who has a crush on his friend Hanabi Ikuta and works as a part-timer in a convenience store. He has a bad unexplained childhood. He believes in living in the present. He is very OPEN towards anyone that doesn’t challenge his ideology of life. Without it, there would not be any clash of the titans in the last episode that was suggested in the last scene of the opening. Ignorance of opposing forces and the fate of our future is bliss after all. He only starts developing after hearing extreme opposing views from different parties which ends up horribly until a Total Deus Ex Machina came to “save” its audience from the truth behind the ending (Masakaki stated that the future is a collateral). Without other people, he is screwed.  
Like Ganta Igarashi from Deadman Wonderland, he is given his own avatar for Deus Ex Machina in the form of a younger, cute, powerful, childlike or immature Asset Msyu who eventually falls for her owner. The number of times and the situations when he is saved by Msyu are incredible. Every time he is screwed, Msyu just does some unexplained OHKO that miraculously got them out of ANY hopeless situation. However, please take note that she herself brought up Kimimaro from a useless stick figure to a reasonable fighter with a clear belief system. Her character development is typical and predictable but interesting nonetheless.  
What about the “antagonist” suggested in the opening before the start of the first episode? He is Souichirou Mikuni, the smart pragmatic businessman counterpart of our protagonist and the saving grace of this show. The emphasis on his characterization, development, and behaviour is a major influence to the entirety of the show. Without this character, there is no [C] and opposing organization to the Financial District. Midas Money is less controlled so its effects are amplified, resulting in grave losses such as loss of loved ones and/or one’s life. There is absolutely no major conflict for the protagonist to resolve. Why he is not the main character is left to your interpretation.  
The rest of the supporting cast, don’t need much attention because they are written to FORCE the two main male leads to fight in the end. Jennifer Satou and Kou Sennoza represent the core contrasting beliefs of Souichirou. Both have unique lives and better reasons to be the main protagonist than Kimimaro because they have logical justifiable explanation for staying in the alternate world. Still, they are wasted because a puppet that eventually becomes them is more interesting than them gaining the same strength as Souichirou. 
For the story, only the Financial District is of any value but lacked focus on its psychological and philosophical aspects. Its origins, purpose, effect on the business world, MMORPG setting with weird characters ranging from Eldritch Abominations to cute humanoid tsundere or kuudere loli characters, Midas Money, [C], unique concepts, etc. are the only reasons why anyone is watching this but all is not present in the first half. [C], the destroyer of bankrupted financial districts, is shown in the later portion of the second half. There are also certain questions left unanswered.  
How does the battle system work?  
Why are certain characters significantly stronger than others regardless of experience?  
Why are governments not cooperating together from the very beginning to prevent [C] from removing countries of existence?  
Who are the people above according to Masakaki?  
Who is the “God” figure in the last episode? 
Is the ending another version of Instrumentality (Neon Genesis Evangelion)? 
Whatever. Let's just focus on the visuals and sound. 
Production values are medium at the very least. They are not outstanding but unquestionably (YMMV) fitting. The opening and ending themes brought me out of my misery whenever I watch this so I never skipped them and watch the preview of preceding episodes. They both start and end the show well every time. Voice acting is fair as well. The style and quality of the art are normal with certain use of CGI. The resulting presentation though is quite good but aesthetics alone don't make any show good ... unless it's porn. 
Simply put, this is not recommendable.

This anime is one that has a lot of good surrounding it by word of mouth, and every once in a while you hear someone say it was meh or not worth watching. When I originally watched this, I had only seen the opening and I thought it was amazing and one of the best openings I've ever seen, as I still hold to this idea today. Upon watching the first few episodes, I was intrigued, but not impressed. When I finally finished it, I felt like I had wasted a tremendous amount of time and immediately wrote it off with a one out of ten and rushed a poorly written and bad review of it here, which no longer exists. Then, after many months, I began to think: ""What if it actually wasn't as bad as I initially thought?"" and so I began the perilous quest of rewatching my most hated anime at this current time, and after finishing it, I wrote this review. 
This review takes a bit to get going to my main points, but if you're seriously considering watching this anime, I HIGHLY suggest you finish my review, and then read some other reviews that may/may not be more positive than mine. 
Art: -/-- 
I will start with the art, as this is obviously the first thing you notice. For a ---- anime, it's definitely up to par and has no really glaring problems, and is actually rather well done. That being said, I have seen much better anime, even in the same year. It also has some CGI, but it's nothing amazing, but it was done tastefully enough that it doesn't seem really awkward or make a bad contrast with the rest of the art. However, a large problem I have with this is if you are watching an uncensored version (AKA Not the TV version) like I had the misfortune of doing, then you will see some anime boobies. This may or may not bother you, but it bothered me as it was unnecessary fan service and it was more creepy and distracting than anything. Why am I mentioning this in the TV version? As a warning to those that there is a difference. The TV version also censors some very odd things, at least to a North American viewer such as myself, like severed limbs. Japan may have some different laws or preferences to us in NA, but it looks really dumb and childish when something like this happens, and it really takes you out of a suspenseful scenario. 
Sound: -/-- 
As I have already stated, the opening is great, and I watch it almost every time. Same goes for the second opening and both endings. I highly enjoy all of these, and they are worth sticking around  for instead of just jumping into the episode or to the next. The background music fits the tone for almost every scene and Tatsuya Kato did a good job in producing it. However, unlike some other music directors, like Hiroyuki Sawano, none of his tracks are very memorable, and so makes the music in the actual anime lacking to an extent, as there was nothing unique or fresh about his style. This is only a real problem for those of us who like anime OST's and will search them up after watching a scene where the song is what really made it for you. 
Story -/-- 
Now this is where my review starts getting negative. If you're a big fan of the show and you don't like constructive criticism, turn away now. The story is about a young boy named Yukiteru Amano who is a very lonely and boring middle school child, who is just going through the motions of life trying not to disturb anyone and only observing the daily events that unfold around him. He himself never takes a large role in anything in his life. The only thing he has to go home to is his imaginary friends, Dues ex Machina, the ""god"" of space and time, and his servant, Mur Mur (Japanese pronunciation Mura Mura, which I much prefer and shall be writing it as such from here on out), who does nothing and a lot of it. One day, Yukiteru wakes up and finds that his diary entries, had already been written for him. Immediately writing it off, he starts his daily routine. Suddenly, the events in his dairy begin to unfold as they were written. Taking advantage of this, he starts utilizing his ""future diary"". However, he is soon approached by a pink haired classmate named Yuno Gasai, who somehow knows what Mura Mura looks like, even though she's just a part of Yukiteru's imagination. Yukiteru is appalled by this, and runs off, only to be continually cut off by Yuno, who then explains to him that there are eleven other diary owners that are all trying to kill each other to become ""god"", as the current one, Deus ex Machina, is dying and needs a suitable replacement in one of these diary holders. Yuno also makes it a point to confess her love for Yukiteru, by showing him her future diary, which tells her everything there is to know about Yukiteru, perfect for a stalker, as she has been doing for the past year. Now, thrust into this game of life and death, Yukiteru, with much help from Yuno, must outwit and outfight his enemies that are the other diary holders. 
Okay, that's the intro. Cue lots of filler and boring episodes where nothing happens, episodes that are really reminiscent of generic ""villain of the week"" shounen anime, and so many plot holes you could sink a ship with them. Upon rewatching this, there were many episodes I skipped because either A: Nothing happens in them, or B: They're just so boring to watch you can't help but skip them. I have so many problems with scenes or ways characters handle things that I could write a spoiled version of this review and it would be twice as long, but I won't. I will just warn you that this anime assumes you're stupid sometimes and creates hype with no build up and no pay off. But let's be honest here. If you have a friend that told you to watch this, but you're not so sure and want to read a review first, there's a reason they wanted you to watch this show... 
Characters -/-- 
Now, for the absolute lowest point of this anime, it's characters. If you're a hardcore fan and decided to still read this review despite my warning, here's where you will be raging. My biggest problem with many shows are weak protagonists. Whether they are just too generic, too perfect, or in this case, too pathetic. Yukiteru, is not a good character. Most anime is marketed towards high schoolers and young adults, hence why most anime is in the Slice of High School Life Rom/Com genre. The reason for this is because if you can have a connection with the characters, you are way more likely to enjoy the show and keep watching. Therefore, when you're mains are all middle schoolers, you can't relate to them as much, or in my case, at all. In a survival game where you have to kill people, I understand why a middle schooler would be hesitant. 
Sake Esuno, the original content creator's solution to this? Yuno Gasai, whose brain doesn't work normally and easily is the first thing that will pop into an otaku's head when they hear the term, ""Yandere"". Yuno murders everyone and anyone who gets in between her and Yukiteru, unless Yukiteru has explicitly told her not to, but occasionally not even then, if she really hates them. While this isn't always a bad thing, listening to a middle school kid cry and scream is not pleasant, even if it's warranted. More on Yuno, she eventually loses all purpose and then begins doing crazy things just to be crazy so that you'll point at the screen, laugh and say, ""Oh that Yuno, always being so nuts!"". This is another part of the ""hype because hype"" driving factor behind some scenarios that ultimately make them blow up in the episodes own face. As for the supporting cast, they are either really well done and don't get enough screen time, or get some but are very obnoxious and you'd just wish they'd go away. Because of this, none of them are worth even mentioning, even though I quite like some of them. 
Overall: -/-- 
I give this anime a three out of ten because I believe it had a ton of potential, but it was only squandered in favor of poor plot devices, lame twists, and boring fillers. An example of this is this anime is way too long. It has -- episodes, but it could have easily been finished in --/--, as the last four/five episodes all drag on very long with extraneous scenes. It may have only seemed like this as I have viewed the show before so I know what was going to happen, but I still feel it could have been shortened. Couple this with some episodes that literally have nothing to do with the plot, and you have a lot of wasted screen time, but more importantly, your time. 
Also, a ""spoilerless"" note about the ending, on the topic of tediously long scenes, I have no idea why there is an OVA other than to make viewers scream at their screen until they find out about the OVA, as the Manga ending is literally two pages away from the animes. Keep in mind, a manga page would contain anywhere from -- seconds to a minute and a half of anime screen time.Sorry, don't mind me. I had to have another tangent, as this anime has given me much to gripe about. 
My final verdict is that this is not worth the watch. However, if, you still decide you wish to view this anime, please watch the subbed version, as the dub for this anime, while not bad, is just wrong, to put bluntly. While the dub voice actors do not do a ""bad"" job per se, I find it vastly inferior to the subbed version, as Tomosa Murata did such a fantastic job as Yuno, even though the character is poor. 
As for alternate anime with survival game themes or feels, I redirect you to instead watch Deadman Wonderland. Bear in mind, Deadman also has a whiny protagonist and a mysterious girl that saves him from everything, and that I don't hold this anime in high regards. I would be cautious with watching it, and even though I enjoyed it, I don't think it's all that special or great, but still a better watch than Mirai Nikki, and you'll spend only half the time. 
For an anime that I did like with a survival game feel, I highly HIGHLY recommend Fate/Zero, the prequel to the Fate/Stay Night series. And if the name ""Gen Urobuchi"" means anything to you, and you haven't seen Fate/Zero yet, I really suggest you fix that. And the dub is amazing, by the way. 
Please rate my review as you see fit, and if you have any questions or clarification, please post to my wall, and I will respond when I see it, thanks!

This review may contain mild spoilers as argumental points. 
Kimi No Na Wa is easily one of the most overrated anime movies of our time. In fact , I don't have a doubt in my mind that Kimi No Na Wa has its #- ranking on MAL simply due to the sheer number of people from a western theater release.  
I jokingly call it the Naruto of anime movies because of its overwhelming popularity and high praise from people who don't watch much anime in general. In fact , if Kimi No Na Wa at the time had been replaced with say , ""Sakasama no Patema"" , it would have had the same effect Kimi No Na Wa had. 
Well that's enough rambling , without further ado. 
---Art : 
Easily the strongest point in the series , done to a very high standard. I'd love to get more into it but it really doesn't need any more explaining. 
-/- 
---Sound: 
There was one track that I really liked during the series but that's about it. The voice acting was just 'okay' , most likely due to the blandness of most characters as I will mention in a moment . Most of the sound from the series quite honestly , felt uninspired.  
-/- 
---Story: 
How people can give the Story a -- is beyond me. 
The amount of crap that is not explained (everything) , use of Deus Ex Machina and laughable ""romance"" in air quotes is appalling.  
I'm well aware of the time constraints a movie has but that's no excuse for an underdeveloped story. NOTHING is explained. Sorry , but random supernatural occurrences that occur because magic is not good enough. That goes for soul switching and time traveling. It would have been SO easy to explain any of these things in a brief moment (instead we get , yay , filler characters). For example , lets say the meteor is of a material not found on earth and has a property that makes it exist in two timelines at once (which could be shown by having a meteor rock change and move between the two timelines in a split screen where one character does something to one half and it changes the one in the other timeline). I just pulled that out of my ass in - seconds and it still would have been better than nothing. 
Cliches and Deus Ex Machina , techniques that impress only the most casual of viewers , were of course present. For example in the diner RIGHT before our protagonist gave up , where the owner just happened to be from there , happened to pay attention to the drawing done by an amateur artist mind you and also happened to be so impressed that he would take him there in his care (in a one way ride to the middle of nowhere , he didn't even question that maybe the kid wanted to go there to kill himself since it was so isolated). Disgusting. 
To call this a romance is laughable at best. A romance between two characters that never even met, and only communicated through pre-written notes. Granted the supernatural nature of the anime , 'of course' they fell in love. But when you think about it logically , for people to fall in love in that situation it would require a special type of desperate , which wasn't shown for either character. 
Story -/- , if my system allowed it I would be rating this lower. 
---Characters: 
Kimi No Na Wa obviously focuses on the two main protagonists and does manage to develop them somewhat. Unfortunately , for all other characters development and emotion is pretty much non-existent. This really wouldn't be a problem in some cases but Kimi No Na Wa has a notable amount of screen time for filler characters. 
For example , the manager lady was completely bland and would have no notable features if it wasn't for her sex appeal to her coworkers , the schoolkid who planned a terrorist attack without a second thought ( actually has some personality , but no explanation for his knowledge and actions ). And last but not least the demented old man , whom anyone with half a brain would question to take a worried young man on a one way trip to a wasteland. 
The two protagonists being somewhat relatable is what saves this. 
Characters -/- 
---Enjoyment: 
Honestly a very mediocre movie. Comparing it to say Sakasama no Patema it feels like a strictly inferior movie and Sakasama was not rated super highly by me regardless. 
It feels just like when The Dark Knight came out , where people were making accounts just to rate The Dark Knight a -- and The Godfather a -. 
If we were to receive more anime movies in theaters I'm sure this wouldn't happen often. 
Regardless of all my criticisms , its not terrible.

Major is such an underrated anime, and I absolutely loved watching it. The further seasons will almost definitely get higher marks from me. The main charm of the series in my opinion is the genuine nature of the drama and the interactions in the character. There was never a point when it came to the characters that I thought ""This would only happen in anime"". That's actually a lie, there is exactly one part where this did creep to mind and holds it back a little bit. Hoshino and Goro's dad got together way to fast to the point where it wasn't exactly believable to be honest. They literally got engaged before they even kissed (at least on screen). 
The rest of the show wasn't exactly amazing, but well done. For the most part the sports scenes weren't too dragged out and somewhat believable, although I found the last game to be a little weak and dragged out.  
Overall, very good show whose highlights is realistic drama, but it is held back a bit by minor details and sound & animation. It definitely did well as a base for future seasons to build on.

I was afraid that the OVA was wrong relevant in the plot because it is one of my favorite animes and this calm the anxieties of a season - (I live in hope): ( 
the OVA was a good excuse to enhance the development of Iroha and mostrarno a more human side of it. Less frivolous and smarter and certainly establesio a better relationship with hachiman leaving one typical stereotypes hope so maybe another OVA why not? 
I definitely exceeded my expectations 
the chapter is simple, but effective to show what is and but leaves you wanting more.  
and part of the final gave me a feeling of melancholy:,) 
I enjoyed the OVA

Yes, this may be biased, but I am speaking from facts and personal opinion.  
Let me begin with a slight introduction. 
Yes, I am a female. Yes, I enjoy shounen-ai/yaoi. And, yes, I despise this anime with a passion. 
The fact that this show has a higher rating than legitimate shows, and is even considered to be a good anime, physically pains me.  
The plot in itself is inconsistent, weak, and unoriginal. The characters were designed as classical anime (incorrect) cliches. The animation was horrible, and the only decent part of it all, was the OST. 
Now, let us begin! 
Yuuri is our protagonist that's a typical underdog character, that deals with anxiety, is obsessive over Victor, and deems himself to be depressed. 
As a person who deals with anxiety, I can say that we do not ""suddenly"" lose our worries when we meet that certain person.  
Just as Yuuri suddenly became the homoerotic and confident skater he was once he met Victor, and began to get coached by him. Wrong. 
Anxiety is not that easily overcome. It's a process, and does not immediately vanish once the correct person comes into our lives.  
Secondly, his character isn't interesting in any way. Although he does fail here and there, he blames his anxiety for everything, and clings onto Victor far too much. 
He idolizes him to a point he named his dog after him. 
He has a double-personality, and is generally uninteresting. 
Victor, the love-interest, over-confident, idol-posed and ""humorous"" character. 
He suddenly decides to coach Yuuri after remembering the night at the banquet when a drunk Yuuri dry humped him as he watched his routine copied by him. 
Also, pole-dancing with the same drunk boy. Ah, yes. How attractive. 
Victor is played as an attempt at humour, as comes off as extremely extra, and frankly annoying.  
Yurio, the tsundere ice-fairy. Heh.  
He's nothing but rude, obviously tsundere, a friendly rival that is a child prodigy. 
He's arrogant, constantly rude towards Yuuri and Victor, and honestly isn't likeable. I don't understand why so many people like him. 
He's way too cliche to be true. 
Other characters such as Christophe, Leo, Phichit, Minami, etc; are there as rivals and provide no plot development. Remove them, and the anime wouldn't change a bit. 
Christophe is a character of attempted sexual comedy relief, yet fails terribly at so. 
The plot is confusing, mostly regarding Yuuri and Victor's relationship. 
They don't act as any couple would, with just occasional hugs, ""good luck charm"" rings, and an overall relationship that's paced far too fast.  
People enjoy this anime solely on the fact that they're both males. If this was a normal romance show, it wouldn't have gotten much praise. 
The relationship is unconfirmed, and although they may have feelings for each other, for whatever reason, we, as the viewers, aren't given important details. 
Everything is resolved with Yuuri's skating. 
The angst is cringe-worthy with the dilemma in episode -- being fixed by Yuuri's perfect performance!!!! 
The ending was predictable, with an extra scene of a skating duet of Victor and Yuuri in matching outfits, with a slight rendition of Victor's theme. 
Yaaay, fangirls cry, I cringe. 
The animation is far below mediocre, with repetitive and uninteresting skating sequences. The camera shots are terrible, and the overall animation is one of the worst I've seen. Unlike Haikyuu's animation with interesting camera shots during the game, it simply pans in and out, focused on the majority of the rink, the given character's perspective (which occurs at least - times), and a focus on the character themselves. 
The opening is simply a looped basic animation with some catchy song. The ending isn't good. The song OST's are enjoyable, to say the least, but are not memorable. 
What most ruined the show for me was the fandom. The obsession from fangirls that deemed this as the most incredible, and perspective-changing anime. 
""Wow, the first anime that allows the main couple to be gay that isn't yaoi!"" 
Me, an intellectual, pointing at the No.- manga/anime. 
And the fact that anyone who disagreed with them was deemed as a terrible person. 
Anyway, in conclusion, I despise this show, heh.

Well here is a review of Glasslip: 
Well how should i put it into words as it was completely shit and i mean it. Glasslip is a romantic comedy slice of life show for which the most part i don't get it as the story is way too predictable and the main protagonist is pieceofshit without any emotions and for the most part a pain in the a** and i don't get the idea of paring each one of the characters as i hate this kind of thing.As for the character development there was too little in it and the character was pretty much generic. 
Well for the good part the animation was done by P.A Works and was pretty good for the most part and for the sound it was good but not outstanding and this is all i can say about this anime as it could have been pretty good if the would have explained it a bit more and answer the questions that were unanswered. 
As for the anime i don't recommend it but if want to watch it then do as you please!!

Here I am and cannot believe I have to do this. 
What could have been an uplifting story about a girl overcoming her fears ended up in a message that basically sums up to ""It's okay to let someone's psyche break as long as you're happy."" 
The ending has been recounted by other reviewers here already, but basically, it ends with Machi seemingly having regressed in mental age, due to the trauma induced by the warped perception of her surroundings caused by her serious inferiority complex. This girl needs professional psychological help, not an idol contest.  
And it's just infuriating how the three main characters around her act. Natsu, the bear, is happily living with the now mentally damaged girl, probably because she acts and plays with him like she was a - year old and showers him with attention.  
Yoshio, who has some seriously troublesome conceptions about how it's okay to sacrifice a little girl (in this case to the idol industry) for the sake of promoting his hometown and is so self-centered, that it's plainly not funny anymore.  
Hibiki, the one you'd hope would step in, since she seems to be the only one with a somewhat working brain and consciousness, doesn't follow through, mainly because of her infatuation with Yoshio, judging by the last scenes. 
All in all, what was a kinda nice show for most of the time has been completely ruined by the ending. The dialog between Machi and Natsu towards the end ( ""You don't have to think about anything anymore."" etc.) reminds me more of a bad end in a psycho-thriller VN than of a slice of life show. And that's probably what it is: a bad end.

You know, this franchise really likes to retell the story of the OYW. I’m serious, there are so many reimaginings, retellings and side stories that it’s ridiculous. Perhaps the most infamous one is Tomino’s MSG Novel Trilogy, which I’ll get around to reading at some point. The most famous for good reasons, however, has to be Gundam The Origin. A -- Volume Manga by Yasuhiko Yoshikazu the retells the whole original series while adding a shit load of new content to it. While I have been planning to read it, lack of accessibility has prevented me from doing so; however I will read it as soon as I get the chance. That said, we’re here to talk about an OVA Series that covers a whole flashback arc exclusive to this Manga. So, let’s get into this. 
Story: 
As stated before, I have not read the original Manga, so I am not aware of what changes were made. The only ones I am aware of are ones that impact the whole Manga, as it makes a couple of retcons that make it so this OVA doesn’t mesh as fluidly with the original series. Either way, by its conception alone, this story is an interesting one. It tells the story of the events that led to the original series, primarily told from the perspective of Char and Sayla (Though Amuro does get some focus in the show’s second half). 
In turn, this ends up giving the OVA a damn large scale. We see the conflict slowly escalate from all sides, showing that actions that before might have seen unjustified and cruel now come across as more sympathetic and logical. A prime example being the death of Zeon Zum Deikun, as the way the story is framed very much shows him as being borderline delusional and overconfident, so Degwin killing him comes across as a more logical choice in the end. 
The OVA is also good at showing how much the early stages of war affect people. Most of the time in Gundam, we start while the war is at its midpoint, but here we see the very beginning and it is terrifying, with denial, paranoia and overall terror running through. This is not a very happy story to say the least. Yet it ironically ends on a hopeful note, as all the chess pieces have come to their proper places, and it is time for a counterattack. 
The OVA isn’t perfect though, with most of its issues being centered in the comedy. Don’t get me wrong, this the humor is really funny and it did get a chuckle out of me (I particularly loved how Dozle Zabi’s boisterous manliness terrified his baby daughter and Ramba Ral having the fight of his life trying to catch baby Artesia’s pet cat) but the problem is that it is a tad over-the-top for the story they are trying to tell. Still though, it’s mostly a nitpick on my part. 
Characters: 
As stated before, Char and Sayla get the most focus. I was at first afraid that they’d make Char a bit too sympathetic, but they thankfully did not. Char is clearly the same paranoid, Sociopathic, manipulative bastard we see in MSG proper, in fact he may even be worse than in MSG, betraying people who legitimately knew of his true goals and wanted to help him. Sayla by contrast goes through hardship after hardship, yet it ultimately allows her to become the person she was in MSG. Plus, she’s just plain adorable at points. And people wonder why I think she’s Best Girl. 
The rest of the cast is pretty good. Dozle Zabi in particular gets a lot of extra scenes that help flesh him out, now being an adorable teddy bear whenever he isn’t in combat. Also, his marriage proposal was hilarious. Beside him, it was also nice to see all of the rest of the main cast of MSG, even if it’s them before they had all their character development, so they can be a bit bratty at times, especially Amuro. 
Animation: 
This OVA looks fantastic. Everything, from the landscapes, to the movement, to the CGI… it all looks amazing in my eyes. That said; I hesitate to say it looks better than Unicorn, and it mostly has to do with the character designs. Unlike with, say, the new scenes from the Zeta Compilation movies and Unicorn, which had character designs that, while recognizably from the UC, looked more updated, this is what happens when you take those old designs and directly port them to modern animation. Combined with the ultra-bright color scheme, while I can’t say they look bad or anything, but it isn’t an art style that particularly appeals to me. 
No Mecha section as I already said all that needs to be said in my ---- review. Moving on! 
Sound: 
The soundtrack is really damn good. I noticed a couple of remixes of old songs, but even the new songs are no slouch either. The Endings are also all great, with my favorites being “Uchuu No Kanata De” and “Hasen No Namida”. 
Voice Acting: 
Likely as a result of how old the original cast had gotten, only Ikeda Shuichi, Furuya Tooru, Furukawa Toshio and Ginga Banjo return (Not counting Narita Ken who reprises his role as Bright from Unicorn). Even then, this new cast is nothing to scoff at, with everyone doing a damn good job. Special props to Han Megumi, Sayla’s new voice (Ironic given that her mum is Han Keiko, Lalah’s old actress), who did a particularly good job. Beside them, there’s also Kakihara Tetsuya, Sawashiro Miyuki, Miyake Kenta, Arai Satomi, Seki Toshihiko, Watanabe Akeno, Yamazaki Takumi and of course, the greatest casting gag ever: Tanaka Mayumi as child Char! NICE! 
Overall: 
Really, what else is there to say about this OVA? It is a fantastic prequel, and one I have no issue recommending. I can’t really recommend it if you haven’t seen MSG as it spoils most of its big twists, but once you do so, feel free to hop right in. Needless to say, it is a must see for all Gundam fans, whether they’re new or old. 
Final Score: -/--

This is a somewhat typical story of a girl who unintentionally ends up in a freak show against her will.  But of course, what goes on behind closed doors is vastly different from what the audience probably imagines. 
While thematically and sometimes visually disturbing, the plot falls short and, in my opinion, isn't very interesting or entertaining.  I more watched it for the shock fact than anything.  Even that mostly fell short, save for a couple scenes. 
Overall, it may be worth a watch if you're into the freak show/macabre scene.  But don't expect a profound or particularly interesting plot.

""Cut yourself to fit the world? Or cut the world to fit you?"" 
Both please. 
Ahhhh, Shadow Star NaruTaru. I sure do wish I could give you a Shadow Star rating. And here I thought Evangelion -.-- was going to be my lowest rated anime that I reviewed. 
Story: -/-- 
The concept is amazing...on paper. Take the well beloved 'Mon' Genre and run it through the gauntlet of Deconstruction tropes! 
Our main character, Shiina, is spending a summer at a relative's place at a beachside. During the August that she spends there, she ends up meeting, and on some level bonding with, a strange creature. She quickly 'adopts' the creature and proceeds to call it Hoshimaru, and take it back home with her. She ends up meeting other young teens that also have similar bizarre creatures, some which look similar to Hoshimaru, while others have about as much in common as a pile of feathers and a pile of bricks. These other teens have a very strong bond with their creatures, to the point of being able to direct them to commit acts from tens of hundreds of kilometers distance. Shiina never seems to find a bond anywhere near that deep with her Hoshimaru. Why? It's never answered. 
There also are two different factions that want to take over the world and enslave it toward their own whims. The first 'faction' dies off in pretty much the same episode it/he is introduced in. The second faction...well, we never find out anymore about them after Episode -, do we? 
Another part of the story is how the Japanese Self Defense Force finds out about the existence of these creatures and their reaction to them. Slight spoiler, but after getting their asses handed to them in a long drawn out battle that ends with an entire city and a signficant amount of the JSDF chemically gassed (A blatant violation of the Law of Armed Conflict), the JSDF responds by... 
doing nothing... 
IN addition an interesting little subplot makes it's way shown in the series is basically an Anti-Bullying PSA stretched across three episodes. And while this one does actually conclude itself, the issue with this little story is that all the 'dramatic, edgy, horror' that occurs in this series really only appears in this part (Except for the Chemical gassing of an entire town). Oh, and did I mention that this little Anti-Bullying PSA trifecta of episodes take place in the LAST THREE EPISODES of the series? You know, after the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT now knows of these things? 
And here is where we get into the first major flaw in this series. The order of events and lack of relation between said events. Serial Escalation never really takes place, as the series gets to it's highest and most dramatic point by episode -, and only begins to try picking back up in the final two episodes.  
In addition; there are not several several cleverly interwoven plots that lead from one bad possibility to another. In fact, most of these plots are quite isolated, and only interconnected because the lead character is somewhat involved. Episode -- is the most egregious. In a short stand alone OVA it wouldn't have been bad. But the introduction of the main character into the events of Episode -- actually are counter-intuitive. The information of what is going on is spoon-fed to the viewer, and the entirety of the events here have no effect on the main character, her 'mon', or the rest of the series, not even in a retroactive manner. 
At this point, you might have noticed that my review seems to veer off into different directions rather then go along one simple all-encompassing tangent. That is because the story really goes in many different directions and can never seem to deliver a solid finishing point on either of them. Henceforth, it actually becomes a bit harder to judge the work. 
Amongst the other works I have reviewed (and those I have watched and not reviewed) which received ratings of -/-- or lower, there was at least a story. But Shadow Star Naru Taru fails at that, and only gets by via having a concept driving it, a concept which is free to take as many detours and side-routes as possible during it's brief run time, leaving us with an ending that isn't as much ambiguous as it is a mere fade out. 
The overall lack of effort into a story leaves me to rate this section as a '-'. Sure, sometimes the subplots were a bit interesting...but there is no overarcing story. There is only an over-arcing concept. 
And what is this concept, might you ask? It's the exact concept I expressed at the start of this review. 
To compare, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Madoka Magica, two of the best known 'Deconstruction' works in anime, had a story. Yes, there was a driving concept in these series. NGE went through two of them subtly with one being the deconstruction of Mecha pilot(s) in the Mecha genre, and a bit more subtly, a deconstruction of isolation depression vs interaction depression, via the Hedgehog's Dilemma. Madoka Magica's concept is primarily to apply themes of deception to the typical Mahou Shoujou genre. But both of these series had a plot and a story, and stayed with them to the best of their abilities. 
As opposed, Naru Taru never actually develops a story as much as it does 'attractions' based off of this theme...this concept. 
A concept alone is merely the suspension and parts of the engine for a story. You can't drive a car with only a suspension and engine pieces. 
Art: -/-- 
In most of my reviews my 'Art' rating is pretty consistent. And that is simply because I pay more attention to the story, characters, and message shown then the art. Yes, it is great to look in the background and see a living world. It's great to look in the foreground and see life through the characters and effort through the objects! And the better the effort, the fewer the immersion breaking errors, and the most amazing a world can become. But alas, Art is still the thing I pay attention to the least, unless it is executed well in a way that adds to the narrative (Like the sharp contrasts of Madoka Magica, the out-of-bonds roughness of Kill-la-Kill, or the smooth upper-class look of Code Geass). Or it has no effort whatsoever. 
And this is the problem here. Save for a few scenes here and there the art, and to a greater extent the animation does nothing. Action scenes are muted by poor animation, character's ranges of expression is intensely limited, and the environment comes off more as a drawing then a world. The amount of effort put into this was nil. Granted, maybe this is because it came from a small studio. But...laziness blatantly set in. 
For example, take a picture of all the female characters in the series within the same 'age' range. Now remove all of their hair. And suddenly, you notice that there is pretty much no difference between the character designs. It was as if the creators, to save money/time/effort/scotch, decided to just use five body models (Teenage girl, Teenage Boy, Adult Male, Adult Female, Overweight Adult Male) and swap faces and hair amongst them. To add onto this insult to the viewer, who I'm guessing they thought wouldn't notice, they try to give each character an identity by leaving them with primarily one facial expression type. This ends up severely limiting the expressiveness of the characters showcased throughout this show. Shiina always looks school-girl happy! Akira always looks about ready to cry (or she is showcasing a bizzare meme face), Takeo is always expression a smug grin, Aki always is expression a female smug grin, etc, etc. The list goes on, and on, and on. Couple this with the overall lack of total faces in the series, and everyone seems to be borderline...unexpressive. 
In addition, the foregrounds are dull and lifeless, and the backgrounds are empty. 
Sound: -/-- 
Sound, along with art helps to make a world feel alive, and in many cases, bring it, in some way, parallel to our own world. Not to mention that the music within a work can heighten or depress the mood in tune with the latest turn on screen. 
Naru Taru's non-musical sound is horrendous. I could give numerous examples, from the flat delivery from the voice actors (Flat Japanese voices, even from my monolingual English ears...) to the strange car sounds. Even the dull sound of the jets. If you have ever heard an A--- Warthog in real life, and then hear the pathetic sound the A---'s in this series give, you also would be dissapointed. But I choose to sum up the poorness of the sound quality with a single sound. 
The gunshot. 
In real life, a gunshot is loud. Overwhelming. It blurs out everything going on. Multiple gunshots somewhat tend to dull this effect, as one's ears somewhat adjust to it and begin picking up on other occurrences (Assuming your ear drums are not being blown out). But a single gunshot is deafening, and in anime, is often used for dramatic effect. 
In this series, a single gunshot is akin to a popping sound, somewhat like a single kernel popping in a popcorn bag. The most gun-like thing it could be compared to would be the handgun in Resident Evil - on the PS-/Sega Saturn. This might be excusable, if not for the fact that the gunshot IS used as a dramatic moment marker. 
But in the process, it actually sucks all the dramatics out of the scene. Again, there are other examples, but this was the most prevalent one in my mind. 
On the music side...it was similarly underwhelming. While the contrast between the music and the occurrence wasn't as blatant as Evangelion -.--'s was, it is bad in it's own right. The very few times it isn't contrasting with the mood or the tone of a scene, it becomes downright generic. Almost Hentai levels of generic. 
There would be two exceptions to this, the opening theme and a few dread-inducing piano pieces in the middle parts of the series. The opening theme is actually pretty darn catchy, with it's little kazoo and spoken lyrics. Time and time again I find myself humming or whistling this catchy little bugger. 
But two or three decent music pieces being the only pleasant thing across the entirety of a -- episode series is downright pathetic. 
Character: -/-- 
The issue with Character is simple. No character is enjoyable, and no character does anything particularly memorable unless they are the arc villian. You'll recall Shiina only for being the generic happy-with-everything girl that the series is breaking apart. You'll recall Akira only for being the dull one that gives early Shinji Ikari and Yukitero Amano meaningful lives. Tomonori is recalled for wanting to kill everyone who has higher education. Hiroko snapped and killed everyone she knew. Etc, Etc. The characters are all one-note characters. 
The only place where this is reasonably acceptable is the new characters tossed into Episode --, who we spend less then -- minutes with, so to expect more from them would be pretty darn foolish. 
As one note characters, the interactions betwixt characters never really goes anywhere. Nobody really changes over the course of the series. Akira from episode - is the same as Akira from episode --. As is Shiina. And every other character who had more then one episode of screentime. Even Hiroko, who snapped and killed everyone she knew, never really demonstrates much of a personality change in the event. 
Enjoyment: -/-- 
Hahaha, enjoyment? Minimal. It peeked to it's highest in Episode -, with the interesting (Yet poorly showcased due to poor animation and poor sound) three way battle between two teams of mons and the JSDF. But it's hard to get invested into a series where every action scene is really subdued, and every character stuck in a virtually unchanging roll. If not for the shortness of the series, I likely would have dropped it by episode -- and not bothered any farther. There is nothing in this series to invest in, and in the process, there is nothing to reap from the show. 
Overall: -/-- 
There are other things in the show I could point at. The blatant bashing-over-the-skull with a 'deep' theme is hyper prevalent, for instance. Events were played for drama...but never really came off as dramatic, and in some cases the problem would be fixed and explained away offscreen, which actually made the show invert the drama it was going for. And the schizophrenic usage of some of the supporting adults, from being well-intentioned yet strict parents to misguided store owners to abusive pricks...*sigh*. Rape is played as drama in the most sickeningly way possible, as if to ok the later graphic deaths and second rape scene. 
I legit can't recommend this series to anyone. For those looking for horrific elements, go ahead and just watch the last three episodes, and maybe you'll be entertained. For those looking for 'edgy' incest, it's a brief two minute scene that just makes the 'villian' of that arc a more blatant villain. You'll find more edgy incest in hentai. For those looking for an interesting deconstruction, I point to Madoka Magica and Neon Genesis Evangelion. For those looking for a deconstruction of the mon genre, I'll point you toward Digimon Tamers. For masochists, you'll likely be bored out of your head by the fourth episode. And for those looking for a series with a deep message or messages, I would point you to Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell:SAC, or any number of other series. 
Just...don't do what I did. 
Don't waste your time on this series. Of everything I have watched, it's actually the first thing that offended me at one point. And I wouldn't wish that onto anyone else.

Story: 
The story was among the worst I've ever seen.  It gives you a dreadful and disgusted feeling in the stomach and now I feel like hating people.  Which is not like me at all.   
Possibly the only part that is ok is the beginning of the anime, and it quickly degrades from there.  At the end there was a slight recovery, then all hell broke loose. 
Art: 
The art was decent, probably the one of the only parts of the anime that did not feel repulsive.

the voice actors/actresses were good, they did a good job making you feel terrible as did the story line 
Character: 
character development is dreadful.  It did not make much sense, even in the beginning and you barely know who is what and what is what. 
Enjoyment: 
I did not enjoy this at all, it does make one hate the world though. 
Overall: 
I was going to average the scores out, but that would be doing too much justice, a ""dreadful"" is the most I can give.

What can I say? It has been months since I started this series and it’s finally come to an end. All I can say is, the psychological trip and philosophy in this anime is diamond-tier. I don’t think there’s problems with the pacing at all and the side stories and supporting characters are what truly built this series to perfection. The plot twists were the most unprecedented moments most of the time. At the first -- or so episodes of this series was what really captivated me. Personally, I have never seen a close-to-realism anime ever. The set up for the plot was well executed. The OSTs were fitting. The opening was unskippable most of the time and if you haven’t seen any episode of Monster in a while, the opening consumes your senses to feel the atmosphere of the series. The endings had sublime messages towards the plot that maybe a lot of viewers didn’t notice until the... ****SPOILER START****  
picture books were revealed... 
. 
. 
. 
***Spoiler end*** 
Anyhow, I wasn’t ---% satisfied with the ending but overall I’d still give it a --. I have never watched an anime so beautifully done. Explored concepts like never before. A classic. Animation not outdated. Lovable and hate-able characters. And many more. Truly a masterpiece.  
Big up to my guy Richard and Martin though. Both of ya’ll real men. I wish they had OVAs or side story mangas for some of the side characters but i guess that’s asking for too much aha.  
Man’s got an exam in May. so hopefully this will be me last anime for the meantime. 
Im glad I watched this series. 
Thank you Madhouse (although it’s a bit late) and thank you Naoki Arasawa. 
This show has a special place in my heart.

""Watashi no Suma tofon gaaaaa!!!"", that lads, is how you sell your anime on the first episode. It wasn't merely for the simple yet humorously comical script, but for the nuances in the animation that was really well executed. 
Hinamatsuri isn't just an anime for the sake of stupid comedic acts, it actually explores a broader spectrum of aspects in life which masterfully blends and delivers emotions to the viewers perfectly-- it is the very epitome of slice of life. One moment you burst into laughter, and the other moment you suddenly have your dry eyes from watching too much anime refreshed with tears.  
The characters are very well defined and they actually mature over time after various situations befall upon them. It truly succeeds in delivering warmth and at the same time, punchlines that are never the same as the usual comedic trope of as any other supernatural comedy anime.  
Easily deserves a score north of -. Considering the reviews of other MAL users, the manga is critically acclaimed, so it's not surprising that with consistency, this anime would be just as good if not better than Gintama.  
Give it a try, and you'll love it for sure.

The biggest disappointment of the season is definitely Inuyashiki. I wanted to love it, but in the end, it was held back by far too many unavoidable issues.  
The first episode introduces you to the melancholy life of a dying man, Inuyashiki Ichiro, who is in a loveless marriage with two kids that despise him. The director gets you truly feel sad for him through quiet and somber moments of him alone in his everyday life.  
I was impressed with how well the director got me to care about a character I just met, but sadly none of the episodes following it quite lived up to its relatively lofty achievement.  
In episode - we’re introduced to the psychotic villain Hiro Shishigami, the most undercooked and confusingly written villain I’ve ever seen in an anime. 
What broke the show for me: 
-. The ratio of chapters to episodes is --:--. I have no doubt this is the cause of the show's horrible pacing issues and underdeveloped characters. 
-. Killing cute little animals doesn’t make you poignant, it’s just edgy and blatant attempt to make the audience feel sad. 
-. Shishigami. A villain with unexplained abilities, unclear motives, and no charisma. 
-. The unbelievable stupidity of the citizens of Japan, real people wouldn’t just stand around and let themselves be killed! 
-. The tone-deaf social commentary. That -/-- episode. I don’t know if it was meant to be social criticism on America, but it came off as incredibly disrespectful and tasteless. It doesn’t matter how many years it has been, there are some lines that you should not cross. 
-. The art quality declines and the CGI look like something out of a PS- era game.  
[Story: -/--] 
At first, the ambiguity of how Inuyashiki and Shishigami got powers drew me into the show. You could interpret it by saying that the aliens wanted to test humanity by giving powers to the best and worst humans. However, the longer I watched it the more I realized that the ambiguity is only there to cover up a lack of any lore and avoid world building. There is nothing deeper at play here. Unless you intend to analyze the sick mind of the show’s twisted author.  
You may not feel it now, but once you get to the end you’ll feel as cynical towards the writer as I do now, it’s just incredibly lazily written.  
Poorly explain logic to the cyborg abilities. The pacing is all over the place. When a show as full of violence as Inuyashiki doesn’t give its viewers any room to breathe between the horror, I can’t help but wonder if the director didn’t even care whether or not we had the time to analyze what we were seeing. Is it just meant to be a fun thrill ride of super-powered cyborg destruction? If so, then why is there no charm or charisma to the characters? Why do they all have realistic sounding voices and realistic designs? The answer is that Inuyashiki was intended to be taken seriously. However, unless you’re able to turn off your brain you won't get much out of it.  
On top of all of the show's issues, the ending is fucking awful. It's so rushed that its ""emotional impact"" hits about as hard as a foam bullet from a nerf gun. I had heard from people that read the manga that the ending was bad so I was prepared. However, nothing could have prepared me for how abhorrently cliche and contrived it was. The entire conflict of the final arc starts and ends in the last few minutes of the final episode. This gave me no time at all for the weight of the situation to sink in.  
It's the kind of ending that is so bad that it hurts the overall quality of the rest of the show. 
[Character: -/--] 
Inuyashiki is a great person, but a woefully undercooked character. The first episode does a great job of getting you into his mindset. He’s a kind caring old man who is for (some unexplained reason) hated by his family and ignored by everyone, then he gets cyborg powers (for some more unexplained reasons) and uses them save lives and be the become the best hero ever. We sure lucked out that the guy who got cool cyborg powers was a compassionate old man… right?  
Then there’s Hiro Shishigami, the other guy who got cyborg powers. He’s Inuyashiki’s foil and the show’s main antagonist. You’ve never seen a poker face until you’ve seen Shishigami, but that’s about all that his character is good for. He murders dozens of innocent people with his powers in long and overdone scenes. We get it! He’s a murderer!! You don’t need ten minutes an episode to remind us.    
Inuyashiki is pushed aside to make room for the less interesting Shishigami, which in turn means the majority of scenes in the show are unpleasant and full of tasteless violence. The potential of Inuyashiki’s character is never explored. I was expecting we would see a subversion on the hero’s journey trope, but instead all that came from his character was a contrived and overwrought melodrama. He’s comparable to a popped balloon that sprays out hot air and fart noises for -- episodes. All pathos, no development.  
Hiro taking center stage is most likely a result of the writer’s obsession with psychopaths and violently killing innocent people because that is just about all Hiro seems to exist for. His logic for doing what he does becomes more convoluted as the show goes on, he changes his motivations at the drop of a hat, never really giving you a chance to analyze his insanity.  
Their conflicting personalities does add some depth to look into. If the good versus evil allegory isn't completely trite to you. Plenty of other better anime have taken on this theme but if you must suffer through Inuyashiki at least you'll have one thing to motivate you to keep watching. It adds an extra layer to read into and its the only character traits that remain consistent throughout the series.  
[Art: -/--] 
Ugly CGI. It looks just as janky and unfitting to the show’s -d art as the CGI skeletons from Dies Irae. Incredibly jarring switches from normal art to CGI that breaks immersion constantly.  
In the first few episodes, the CGI is used frugally and only during action scenes, it is used to capture the complexity of the mechanical cyborg components and their small details. At first, I praised the CGI for being used creatively and only when necessary, but in the later episodes, it is used much more. The worst part of the CGI is how awkward the characters’ faces look. It looks like something from a PS- era game. Even their designs are a bit bland. I’d I expect the designs to be original enough to pick up a bit of slack because the characters have no charisma and very poorly defined personalities. There are better ways to create realistic characters than generic designs and tame attitudes.  
For Inuyashiki to be airing at the same time as the groundbreaking CGI oriented anime “Houseki no Kuni”, it only makes its issues a hundred times worse.  
[Sound: -/--] 
Metal as hell opening and a very mellow ending. Both sound amazing, the opening is really well animated and it sadly becomes the highlight of the show during the final episodes. Good sound effects, but lacking in a certain punch. Even Houseki no Kuni felt more impactful than this.  
Realistic voice acting works for drama, but this is an action-heavy show and some of the ranges required the characters were out of the voice actors capabilities. The yelling in particular sound really awkward. It's commendable that they were going for something unique but it didn't work out in my opinion. Oh yeah, I should mention Shishigami's stupid finger gun. ""BANG BANG! BANG!"" That shit got annoying real quick.  
[Enjoyment: -/--] 
It was around episode four that it hit me, Inuyashiki is an anime that actively tries to make you feel horrible. This anime almost always strives to make you feel just as depressed and hopeless as it's characters. And well, it usually succeeded at its pointless goal of upsetting me. If it weren't of such a low quality I probably would have felt depressed through its entire runtime. 
If you really for some reason want to feel disgustingly upset for - hours straight, well all I can say is good luck taking this show seriously. Due to the head-shakingly stupid reactions of the people of Japan have to the horrors that Shishigami commits it becomes more like a comedy than a tragedy.  
People get killed in ways that wouldn’t be out of place in a show like Ousama game. There’s no logic to how the cyborgs work, at least not in the show. Shishigami kills people through cameras with his finger gun, Inuyashiki heals people from any ailment. I was hoping to get some enjoyment from trying to figure out the alien story and the cyborg originations or even just analyzing the enigmatic Hiro, but nope. Inuyashiki has done such a great job of making me feel cynical towards it. The combination of shoddy visuals, underdeveloped narrative, unexplored characters, and frustrating action made it a slog to get through.  
[Final Score: -.-/--] 
A studio as well known as MAPPA seems so lazy to be cutting corners like this especially when smaller studios are producing work that is miles better. The moral of the story? Go watch Houseki no Kuni if you want to see an actually good example of CGI used in a creative way rather than a crutch to support a lack of budget.

*Disclaimer* 
Just personal scratch. 
Advised, possible spoilers. 
Opinion & Informal  
Note #-: Going to make a few slight comparisons to the manga in regards to what I personally would have preferred to have been adapted.  
Art: -/-- This season did much better than the last. CGI models and backgrounds/environment. Certain scenes and animations were in a more traditional drawn style. There were more drawn scenes in this season than the last which is a plus. The CGI models weren't too bad and seemed a bit better than the last. Overall there were decent enough improvements art-wise and model-wise compared to the previous season. There was still the problem of not giving too much dedication or attention to the impact-shots which I had mentioned about in the previous season. What I mean is that I wish the beautiful impact-shots that were done in the manga would have been better adapted in this season. Those were quickly skimmed over and I wish there would have been a focus on those bits. Proportions and anatomy were okay. Monsters looked alright and didn't look too cheap or low-effort.  
Animation: -/-- About the same as the previous season. Sort of clunky still, but it didn't use too many cut-shots this time. Some scenes and motions such as sword swings were actually shown on some occasions. Movements such as walking and running were okay for the most part, though there were indeed some awkward moments. Some of the special effects were nice to look at but they weren't super impressive.  
Characters: -/-- I feel like the characters weren't as fleshed out in this adaptation as I would have liked. Their grievances, resolutions, and feelings weren't captured as well as I would have liked. Yes, all the cast was there. Characters weren't missing exactly, but at the same time they did feel like they were missing. Now this territory is in what the individual thinks and concludes for themselves, but I personally felt that Isidro  (I personally pronounce it as Ishidoro) had feelings of inferiority? When I read the manga I personally, repeat: personally, think that Isidro began to harbor a slight jealousy? inferiority? realization? not sure, towards (I pronounce it as Shirkee) when Isidro saw how much more capable she was compared to himself despite being about the same age. There was a slight hint of that during their whole troll den escapade but it was so skimmed over and practically ignored. Mmm, if I wanted to just be easy about it I would just say that the characters seemed so flat in this adaptation. They didn't really have the same ""life"" I felt they had in the manga.  
Plot: -/-- Goes up to the Holy See's harbor part right after Isidro reconciles with Shirkee when he had messed up her hat. It leaves off at a sort of weird spot. 
Development: -/-- I'm okay with what went on here. There was some freedoms taken but this season did much better than the last in terms of following the source timeline. I don't have much to say because they things that were supposed to happen, happened. I wasn't particularly surprised by anything because I'm already familiar with the source. If we're talking about parts that were well done I would say that the initial donning of the Berserker Armor was cool, but it was only cool. It wasn't well done, it was cool. The ""Ash Crow"" song that played during that part sent a slight chill down my spine. That bit was nice. I'm not comfortable in saying that anything in this adaptation was truly well done. I dislike how the bit on the consequences of Guts turning on his friends was skimmed over. I also dislike how pulling him back from his enraged-mode was skimmed over as well.  
Music: -/-- This season did much much better in using its theme songs appropriately, especially during impact-scenes. This season used pretty much the same osts, soundboard, and sound design as the last but it did so in a much more noticeable fashion. The ""CLANGs"" weren't as prevalent in this season and didn't overwhelm the music which is either a plus or minus depending on the person. For example, The ""Hai Yo (Oh Ashes)"" was used in battle scenes and was noticeable in how it was used and the right times. Same for the ""My Brother"" song. The ""Ash Crow"" song was also used appropriately in my opinion. I gained a new appreciation for Ash Crow and have actually come to like it a lot. The song really brought out a sense of dread and a foreboding air whenever it played and fit the scenes it was used in.  
Conclusion: -/-- Sort of underwhelming ending. Gave us an ""It continues"" or whatever at the end of the last sequence. Open-ended ending for another season I suppose? It answered a few questions and did its best to whip up some sort of meaningful resolution-ending for Shirkee.  
Overall: -/-- Enjoyed it a bit better than the previous season, but in terms of pacing and where it leaves off I don't like it. This section of Guts' journey is the ""Going on an adventure with me and my friends."" bit. They could have at least focused a bit more on certain developments and growth areas than going along with the story at an unreasonably quicker pace. Overall I have mostly the same gripes as what I thought about the previous season. There were some improvements art, animation, and music-wise but those aren't enough to make up for failing to capture Berserk as a story. This adaptation was okay.

I thought SEEDs gave you trees and flowers, not politics and robots! 
*SPOILERS FOR GUNDAM SEED. I WILL BE REVIEWING THE ---- HD REMASTER. TO ANY DIEHARDS OUT THERE, PLEASE DO NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH THE FACT THIS GOT A SCORE LESS THAN - OR --? ALSO, PLEASE WARD OFF SEED HATERS FROM ATTACKING ME DUE TO ME ONLY GIVING IT A DECENT SCORE?* 
Ah, Gundam SEED. One of the more vocally divisive Gundam shows out there despite having a higher MAL score than most Gundam shows. I have a weird experience with this show, and honestly, the tone of this review will likely flop between positive and defensive, and cynical and negative. There is a LOT to talk about regarding my experiences of this show, and let me say, I wanted to put this down several times in the first half. Also, this is melodrama incarnate. Not much of a hyperbole there. Now, was it worth it, or did it blow up in red mobile suit smoke? Let's find out, shall we? 
STORY: -/-- 
Let's talk about the premise. A group in space declaring hostility against the Earth Federation, the group attacking a civilian base in the Federation, only for our protagonist to find a Gundam during the time his neighbors are dying, and stops the attack only to find out he must now join an army after most of the civilians in his area have died. That's right. If you've caught on, you would know that this show starts off as a ripoff of the original Mobile Suit Gundam. The rest of the show is about two coordinators forced to fight in opposite sides of a war as they make friends and hope to not have to kill each other. Also, there are plenty of politics, not just between the two sides, that being Earth and the PLANTS, but also between Earth and ORB and even among ORB members, Earth forces, and PLANT forces. It is interesting seeing many attempts to stop this war with minimal bloodshed and with more diplomacy. That, and there are some really strong moments in the story, like in episode -- or -- for the HD remaster. However, there are a good number of gaping plot holes throughout, and they get increasingly large throughout, and it dosen't even TRY to explain or hand wave anything like with Code Geass or Gurren Lagann, not that hand waving disagreeable plot points is a good thing.  
The SEED mechanic is the biggest deus ex machina crap ever, since we don't even know the FIRST THING about it other than it being a voluntary-ish deus ex machina. Also, the finale in particular has a few ass pull moments that would rival those of Gundam -- -nd season. However, it does pose some interesting politics and moral ideologies, the latter of which, if done even remotely correctly like with this show, can really help an otherwise flawed as frig plot such as this. Also, expect some horrific cases of Sunrise's bring characters back to life/ don't kill off characters when they have no chance of survival. Believe me, the latter happens to the protagonist TWICE, and the former actually happens to one minor antagonist in particular, and believe me, they use these a lot in this show, and it's almost maddening in certain situations. Plus, the execution of the ending was kinda dumb, and even has that whole deal Sunrise does that I just mentioned. Plus, the melodrama is extreme, and more often then not, not worth it. They should've really toned it down at points. 
CHARACTERS: -/-- 
I'll be upfront. The characters in the first half bothered me for most part, particularly in the second cour. However, they certainly got a lot better in the second half, even with a few things wrong here and there... Now, Kira Yamato. His moral compass towards the middle of the first half becomes such an unbelievable moral compass, that he actually becomes rather unlivable at points, however, thanks to Andy, a charismatic antagonist with a bleak yet common (in this show at least) viewpoint of war, Kira actually reflects on his actions and moral compass, and becomes a more cohesive individual because of it. Many side characters aren't that special but are decent none the less, except Mu La Flaga. He was kinda cool. There are two I need to mention though. Sai. Poor Sai. Got treated poorly by Flay, and got his ass nearly kicked by Kira, and disappeared for most of the final arc for some reason. Literally, he's hardly even there at all for the last -- episodes. As for Flay, *SIGH* oh boy. She is so damn useless and bitchy. She literally contributes nothing but drama, and that's what makes her a faulty character rather that a character who we're supposed to hate for the right reasons. Now, some of the villains actually have a point in their messed up ideals, but don't have a whole lot going for them aside from Andy, and the most prominent antagonist, Le Cruset, who gives us an ASTOUNDING performance in the last - episodes. There is also Arthrun, who's probably the best protagonistic character here. His comrades, are mostly good at their job as characters and pilots, except for Yzak, but even he improves towards the end. There's also Lacus, who's songstress idol part of her character is underutilized, and has a drastic and not built up surge of maturity around episode --. Unfortunately, for episodes ----, I could not stand a lot of these people, and that's a big problem with the second cour in particular, even if, like I said, the second cour actually makes many of them actually tolerable. 
ART: -/-- 
For the good, there's the Gundams and other Mobile Suits. They look cool, and many of the battles, especially in the last - episodes, look pretty cool, especially those laser effects in those last - episodes, not to say they didn't look good before, because they did, but it's obvious that they pulled all the stops in the last - episodes. At points, the character models can look ok.  
For the bad, just about everything else. The character models look so damn wonky. Back in the mid-----'s, many companies tried their hand at digital animation, but for the most part, failed to get it right until ---- with shoes like Haruhi and Code Geass using it to excellent effect. This show, Gundam SEED, highlights just how bad it can get. The facial expressions look horrendous at many points, and it takes a while to even adjust to the wonky digital models. Hell, there is a lot of Studio Sunrise's trademark animation recycling going on, especially with the openings and fight scenes, way more than normal, and that is just unacceptable. Also, the CGI is hideous and poorly integrated a whole lot, especially in the first half.  
SOUND: -/-- 
The OST, is pretty good with many well done emotional pieces, and Lacus's song that's sung a few times, (""In this quiet night"") is good too. Now, OP - and OP - both kinda suck. They are pretty weak despite some cool points. Now, OP -, is pretty damn awesome, and actually gets pretty catchy. OP - is very nice and just perfect as a way to encapsulate the final stretch of this anime as it just feels like something nice and emotional and gratifying coming to an end (even if this show up until the final cour has been kinda bad), making it just as good as OP -. Now, for ED -, it also fails at being an emotional piece. ED - for the original, is pretty. Now REMASTER ED - on the other hand, is definitely a great emotional ED, and I loved it. Now, ED -, which only plays once in the HD version, is decent enough. Now, the dub. It's awful.Most of the voices are downright terrible, and they even swapped the good sound effects of the original with some crappy stock sound effects just to censor this for young Cartoon Network audiences, which this show can only really cater to anyone over the age of --. Damn Bandai dub. 
ENJOYMENT: -/-- 
The first - episodes left me believing that this show would be pretty good. However, most of the episodes from the range of ---- infuriatied me and I nearly dropped it. Luckily most of ----- was decent afterward, especially with Andy. Then, most of the episodes after that were actually pretty alright, sometimes even good, minus the plot holes. The battles got progressively better for the most part as well. Still, that second cour was hell. Can't forgive that... 
OVERALL: -/--   RAW SCORE: --/--- 
Overal, I was kinda disappointed in some areas, and even with how cool the -nd half got at times, it just has too many major plot holes to be truly good, and the characters aren't that great either, mostly. That's not to say that I thought this was a genuinely bad series, but he first half definitely hindered this series as a whole, and the plot holes are egregious. Sure, the fights got cooler as the show progressed, but the second cour, man did it leave me sour! Still, after that it grew much nore tolerable and fun, even if the plot in that half got worse. Even still, I can see why some people do praise this series. It has some decent conflicting ideals and actually tries it's hand at politics in war and had characters make peaceful attempts at resolutions. I just wish it was less derivative and full of infuriating melodrama and awful character art and CGI. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu.

There have been many entries to the RPG, fantasy category of late, of which Konosuba is an interesting addition. It's a show that doesn't take itself too seriously with slapstick comedy everywhere and a plotline that is engaging yet still light. If you're looking for an easily digestible show that will give you some hearty laughs, you've found a wonderful option. 
Konosuba is about a guy who dies, in a pretty darn humiliating way. As in Yu Yu Hakusho, he is granted a second life by a blue-haired deity. However, this second life will be in a different parallel world of the dungeons and demons sort where he must fight to defeat the demon lord. To aid him, he is allowed to bring one thing of his choice, be it a possession or ability. To spite the nonchalant yet condescending god, he decides to bring her along and thus we have our show- a NEET turned adventurer and his pet god who only complains and causes trouble like the girlfriend out a hell. 
Animation: 
The show is drawn in a relatively simple manner with relatively light shading and detailing (I'm comparing against Phantom World, which is of the same season). The bright colors and high saturation make for a light and casual atmosphere, which is perfect considering where the plot goes. Backgrounds are mostly simplistic and blurred though there are occasionally scenes with nice detailing and backgrounds. There's a multitude of characters both primary and secondary in fitting, medieval garb, which makes our tracksuit-donning protagonist stick out humorously. All the characters are unique in both appearance and abilities and are rather all on the lively side. Emotions are often very strong and overstated in the show, fittingly so. 
This show has a fair amount of action though the stakes are often raised to extremely dire levels only to be resolved in a rather ridiculous manner. Expect a lot of flashy explosions (literally) and effects to complement the magical nature of the show. Don't expect too much in terms of choreography or swordplay as this show is much too light for any of that. Opponents are occasionally rather humorous and include an assortment of haro-like flying cabbages, giant toads, a headless knight, and a monkeylord. There is also a fair amount of ecchi in the show ranging from an ability to steal objects (such as panties) to open bath scenes with well-placed washcloths and sparkly lights. There's also a fair amount of implied ecchi thanks to the masochistic nature of Darkness. 
Sound: 
The show starts with an energetic, light pop piece with a fair melody and ends with a really slow piece sung by the VA gals, with fitting instrumentation given the setting. The BGM isn't anything amazing but does sound reasonable for the genre; just don't expect SAO level production here. The most notable tune is obviously the ominous preparation song whenever Megumin prepares to use explosion. 
The VA cast delivers with strong personalities in this show. Ai Kayano does a great job voicing darkness and though Sora Amamiya's character is hella annoying, it's an interesting and convincing departure from her more quiet previous roles. You also have Rie Takahashi from Sore ga Seiyuu playing the crazy chuunibyo wizard. Finally, you also get a bit of Yui Horie in the latter episodes as well, feels like a cameo almost. 
Story: 
Kazuma had, from an outsider's perspective, a horrible life filled with games and otherwise being a drag on human society. Luckily, in his second life, he now has a chance to defeat the demon lord and bring a parallel world to a happier era- or so the story hints. Unfortunately, he is doomed by countless, sometimes hilarious, setbacks and ends up just having a good time making friends. 
The show doesn't have a strong central plot pull, as it's more about characters goofing off while slowly leveling up RPG style. There are countless mini climax moments but no arc stood out in particular, mostly because they're often contained within a single episode. In the end, they don't really make all that much progress, though it's already known that there will be a season two. If they continue at the current pace though they won't make it to the demon lord until season twelve. 
Character: 
The characters in the show have a lot of personality. Each of the main cast has their strengths and their often laughable weaknesses. For instance, Aqua has strong magical abilities but it is offset by her naive personality and absurdly bad luck. However, the team of Kazuma and his misfit harem works pretty well together and successfully completes various quests. The group has some fun interactions though most of them are between Kazuma and the individual gals. Don't expect any romance or deep relationships in this light piece. 
Value: 
Konosuba isn't a masterpiece; it knows it and makes fun of itself knowing it- that's what sets this show apart from so many others in the fantasy realm. If you're just looking for a laid back show to enjoy, you've found it. If you want something more tense or story-driven, SAO is still my highest recommendation with No Game No Life close on its tail.

I wanted to love this series, I really did. The first - episodes were amazing, I honestly thought I had a masterpiece in my hands but as the show progresses I am proven pretty wrong. The story was brilliantly intriguing, the characters interactions rivetting, but sadly that's the only thing that has kept me from dropping the show this far. The plot alone is flawless in my opinion and the premise pretty unique, though it is a bit strangely paced at some points that's forgivable. 
Generally, my biggest pet peeve with it is the slow but sure decrease in the quality of the art, I mean it happens with most anime as they progress but with Banana Fish, it was extremely noticeable, like to the point where in some frames the characters don't even look like themselves and it bothers me to no end. The first few episodes were really well animated and I have to admit the unique look was one of the things that got me into it in the first place but its so sad to see what it has become at this point. 
Another pet peeve was the soundtrack, I want to like it but in most scenes, it just ends up making me cringe. It just comes off as cheesy or overdone. I mean the scenes are meant to be dramatic or heart wrenching but they just end up falling flat as the soundtrack can't carry particular scenes or they are just really poorly framed. 
The characters are Banana Fish's saving grace. Honestly, they are pretty well constructed and as the audience, you really end up emotionally invested in what they are going through. All in all, the show is worth watching purely for the story and characters and I still do recommend that everyone interested watch this show. It might not be a masterpiece but its definitely quite original.

The only thing I liked about DBZ Kai was because it followed the manga more than DBZ. However, I was disappointed by the visuals because, when they mentioned a ""DBZ remake"", I though that the animation would be new. Instead, the animation was ""remastered"". Not as I expected. Also, I was really disapointed because the Majin Buu arc was never shown. It seems to me that Akira Toriyama gave us ""remastered"" version instead of a full remake because he probably wanted to make maximum profit without spending a f*ckload of money.

‘Seirei no Moribito’ (‘Moribito, for short) is a very polarizing series. Many praise it for its stellar production values, great atmosphere and layered, believable characters. Others find the show relentlessly boring and slow-paced, disparagingly referring to it as ‘Boribito’. 
I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle. 
The basic story is the typical tale of a seasoned warrior seeking to atone for a checkered past by protecting a child who’s being hunted by powerful forces both human and inhuman. Moribito’s narrative, however, manages to distinguish itself through - things: excellent character development and meticulous world-building. 
Protagonist Balsa in particular is a great example of the former. Her strong, dignified personality, captivating backstory (subtly alluded to initially) and multi-faceted interactions with other characters make her one of the most well written anime protagonists around. The hunted child in question, Prince Chagum, doesn’t fare quite as well. He goes through a fairly predictable character arc that boils down to learning to live like a commoner and growing up. There’s also a handful of moments where he displays unusually keen insight that feel rather forced. Though it must be said that the conclusion to his story has a surprising turn that’s both surprising and very poignant.  
As far as supporting characters go the biggest standout is Tanda, Balsa’s dogged love interest whose difficulty reaching out to her makes for an interesting if pitiable character. Others aren’t quite so interesting: there’s - kids who hero-worship her who mainly serve to run errands for Balsa and provide some humorous moments as well as an old lady who’s mainly there to provide exposition and snide remarks. The latter sticks out like a sore thumb by feeling like an archetype in a series filled with fully fleshed out characters. 
And I really do mean that last part, even a good deal of antagonists are developed and given (somewhat) sympathetic motives rather than being raving psychotics who can’t go - minutes without strangling a puppy. Moribito’s willingness to avert this easy, manipulative sort of characterization is yet another strength of its storytelling.  
Sadly, not all of its storytelling is as stellar. While the series also goes to great lengths to expand on its world, it also becomes a weakness. Many a times the series devotes an entire episode to fleshing out one particular section of Moribito’s world. And while it certainly helps to make the series’ world feel more alive one can’t help but feel that a more deft storyteller could reduce the content to a subplot without losing any relevance or impact. As it is Moribito has a stretch of episodes in the middle that have very little to do with the conflict that kicked off the story which, when combined with the glacial pacing, makes for a somewhat frustrating viewing experience at times. 
Another fault with the storytelling that it contains a number of contrivances and other moments that feel all too convenient for the main characters. This is particularly jarring in regards to Balsa, whose vow to never again take another life should be rather cumbersome when being hunted by highly skilled assassins. In the series, however, it is mostly a slight inconvenience. There’s an episode around the halfway point that takes it to its most absurd extreme, ending what should have been a grave no-win situation in a big copout. Moribito certainly isn’t the only series to be guilty of such things nor is it the worst example but it’s jarring nonetheless. 
The visuals and audio of this series has been the subject of much praise, and for good reason. The animation, from characters doing chores to the lightning fast action sequences, is consistently stunning and the amount of detail is simply staggering. This is easily one of the best-looking TV-anime ever produced and a worthy part of Production I.G.’s legacy in that regard. In terms of character designs Moribito opts for a more realistic style which perfectly fits the serious tone. The audio is of similar quality. Sound effects are believable and the music always does a good job complementing what’s happening on-screen even if it’s not very memorable in and of itself. The astounding presentation manages to make even the slowest episodes more enjoyable than they have any right to be.   
Moribito is, without a doubt, a very ambitious project. It boldly stands out stylistically and in a narrative sense. Providing multi-faceted, believable characters and captivating situations all set in a gorgeously rendered word. It also deserved accolades for refusing to use its female protagonist for fanservice-oriented jokes which would only undermine her character. There’s a maturity to the way the overall product presents and carries itself that most anime series wouldn’t even consider. All of this makes ‘Seirei no Moribito’ a series that, in spite of some missteps, is worth checking out by anyone open to a more serious style of anime.

PLASTIC MEMORIES 
Plastic memories is one of those 'what if' anime's. It makes me wonder what if they just refined the show a little and how much of an improvement that would've made. 
PROS 
Plastic memories is one of the few anime's that doesn't feel rushed in its -- episodes. Generally speaking, most romantic comedies with ----- episodes always feels rushed so i commend Plastic memories on overcoming this. I found the comedy to be good acceptable, I wouldn't say every episode made me laugh, but the ones that did, really made me laugh. 
CONS 
Right so this could very well be a very subjected personal opinion but I feel like Plastic memories does a terrible job with character traits. At times it felt like it jumps leaps and bounds ahead of what one character's personality was to enhance the current situation, I wasn't too welcoming of this strategy. I also, unlike many others, disliked the start of this anime, I felt it to be bland and it lost be by the first episode, only after continuing a month later, did I find some interest in the anime. 
Should you watch? 
I think if you really enjoyed episode one, and this science sort of genre then you won't be disappointed. It isn't bad in any means and I would say its the best sci-fi romance there is.

Made in Abyss. It was an anime at first glance seem like some typical adventure kids show. However, we are at the end of summer, and I am having a fucken boner. 
The anime was made by Ninema Citrus, which aired in summer ----. By manga fans of the series, the adaptation was super hyped by the lot. However for us non manga viewers, it's a different story because of that chibi like art, which repels a bunch of viewers including me. I know a bunch of casuals who considered the anime trash because of it. But when I saw the anime being so high, I decided to watch it and let me just say, I saw why manga readers were hyped for this. It just did so many things right, hence delivering in every aspect to an extremely high standard.  
(Note: this was a repost of my first review, just tweaked.) 
Plot: -/-- 
The plot was done extremely well, I can't stress how much I loved it. 
The execution of the Abyss and it's mysteries were done excellently. I loved how we get just enough information to understand it, however doesn't give too much away. This allowed the Abyss to have possibly one of the best world buildings I saw in recent anime time, which must be credited. The story of Riko and the search for her mum was also executed well. I personally see this story as a way of revealing what the Abyss really is, and hence giving as a practical example of the dangers of it. The stories in between I found to be near perfect. They were engaging and at the same time, allowed the reader as mentioned to see the true dangers of the Abyss. Telling the story in the perspective of Riko was smart, as it allowed the reader to see how as an immature kid will she grow, which I'll get to how well this was done in the characters section. This story is quite complex, which is understandable since this is an anime for analysis. However it never felt too complex to the point of confusion, as the pacing was done exceptionally well. 
The pacing I found to be perfect. The slow beginning allows the reader when their minds are peaked with thoughts, to be given their first piece of information about the Abyss. After you are given your information, the anime immediately goes faster for you to experience these dangers, which in my books, is pure genius. However, I would had liked the beginning to be slightly shorter because it might had dragged on for far too long. 
I found the anime to stick to its genre. It was an adventure fantasy anime which was consistent throughout the anime. I found the main theme of the anime is being aware of what is real and what is words. The entire point of the anime is to mislead you to think something, however was really something else, which is a fairly great theme to explore. A sub theme is having friends which is a nice touch to this anime. 
Now the ending...ohhhh boy the ending was out of this world. It mixed the right amount of emotions to fully make the reader feel what the characters were feeling. It also built upon the characters that had yet to be built at that point of the anime. To add to the fuel of fire, the arc the series ended was what really made hardcore fans love this series, and I was no exception. I am sure this ending was a setup to get a second season of the anime. 
Overall, the plot was done to a brilliant standard. It had the right amount of execution of plot, pacing, exploration of themes and ending it in style to truly engage the audience into this anime. Despite things being off like the beginning, this anime certainly delivered in a plot aspect. 
Character: -/-- 
Characters were another very strong point of the series, and I'll explain why I believe this view. 
I found the characters to be very relatable. They all had reasonable motives into doing what they did in the series. Take this analogy, your friend is about to turn into Frankenstein or something through an experiment and you don't want them to suffer from this, so what would you do? Break them out, which did happen in some way in Made in Abyss, allowing these characters to be relatable. They were also realistic, especially Riko and Regu. The immaturity of Riko and Regular allows the readers to see them as themselves as a child, like I totally understand why she did what she did in the series, which is very good and should be appreciated.  
Development of characters was spot on. Riko definitely saw some development into a more mature character towards the end of the series, and certainly felt as though in the next arc, she won't commit the same mistakes she did in the first season. Her development was reasonably normal, as we can see how once she makes a mistake, it didn't happen again. Regu also developed as a person, gaining new skills as he journeyed with a Riko. Let me just say, these two as a partner has very good chemistry. They weren't the only characters fleshed out. Others such as Nanachi and Ozen also had their fair share of fleshing out. Without going into too much spoilers, I'll just say that Nanachi was what really made the series alive, which watching it will allow you to see why. 
Except the end, the antagonist wasn't really revealed, and I would had liked to see it more. The side characters were certainly an interesting bunch to me. They had the right amount of screen time to be seen, which made us not forget them for too long during their respective arcs. 
NanachiIsMyWaifuAndAllOfYouStayAwayFromHer-literally what it says 
Therefore, the character section of the anime is brilliant. The development and realism really sets the bar high for any other animes that can be closely compared to Made In Abyss, however I would had like to see the side characters just a little more than in the series. 
Animation: --/-- 
I actually found the animation to be the strongest point to the series for various reasons. 
To begin with, the designs of these characters were gorgeous, like holy sweet rabbit. The moment I saw some of these characters I immediately fell in love with them. I feel like the chibi designs were deliberate to truly show the immaturity of the main characters, and how they don't see the danger ahead of them. 
Animating the series was done well too. I did not see any sort of laziness and wasn't jarring to watch. The art style for this anime was very unique, like pretty much one of their kind, which is an art style I totally want to see again. 
The backgrounds were also out of this world. It gave an atmospheric view of the Abyss, and how there is something off with this world. I can't really complain too much about it. 
Overall, amazing designs. Animation, background and just the fact of the uniqueness of the anime truly allowed it to flourish in the animation department 
Sound: -/-- 
I found the song choices and voice actors to be chosen well, to the point where I had minimal complaints. 
The op is quite catchy, and gets you hyped up for the series.  The ending was also a nice close to the episode to me. Getting the voice actors to me was quite smart, as it further adds into the misleading nature of the anime. 
The voice actors played their part fairly well. No one really kept out of character, and they didn't sound too annoying at one point of the series 
Concluding this part, the sound was done well, however wasn't exactly an excelling point to the series. 
Enjoyment: --/-- 
Every ep reinforces even further why this anime is brilliant. The anime manages to engage the reader through it's unpredictable nature, which by the anime goes on, the less predictable becomes. At one point my predictions were the complete opposite of what actually occurred, which was kinda sad in my part.  
Another strong factor which engages the reader is the characters, especially Ozen and Nanachi. These two characters are what really brought the series fully alive, and were very entertaining to watch for anyone.  
Nothing else much to say other then how incredibly engaging the anime was. 
Overall: -.--/-- 
Overall, this was definitely the dark horse and best anime of the season. People should never ever get misleaded by art, otherwise they'll miss gem animes like Made in Abyss. This anime offers so much to get the audience thinking, which they handled it perfectly by giving us the right amount of information to build on their fragile minds. The character development is near perfect, the music was good and the animation had very strong symbolism, it was just an anime full of mystery, engagement and sometimes even fun. I sure hope they will be a season - and will be equally as engaging as the first. 
I'd definitely recommend this masterpiece to any non casual viewers. Casuals will find this boring because of the lack of action scene and ""questionable"" art, but for non casuals, this is a very veteran anime you should get into. This is because of how you have to see between the lines to fully reveal the true nature of this anime, hence why I consider this to be for those who had a watched a handful of different genres of anime.

Spice and Wolf was originally a series of light novels written by Hasekura Isuna. The original novel won him the silver prize, or third place, for the Dengeki novel prize. The novels ran for seventeen volumes and the series quickly got manga, anime and video game adaptations. The first anime was done by Imagin, the studio responsible for Strawberry Panic among others. Spice and Wolf is really popular, but is it good? Let's take a look at the anime and find out. 
The main story begins with an ordinary merchant named Craft Lawrence. He's going through a small village that's holding a festival when he finds a naked woman with lupine ears and a tail napping in his cart. She identifies herself as Horo the wise wolf, about a half a dozen times, and claims to be the deity that the villagers used to worship. She's grown weary of dealing with the people of the village and wants to return to the north. Lawrence agrees to take her. The series follows their journey as they go through several villages trying to make a profit. Let's dive right into the issues. The biggest issue is that there are a lot of moments that just drag on and get boring. Particularly the moments where Lawrence exposits about the economy of their fantasy world. They could have easily lost two or three episodes worth of content by cutting these speeches and lost nothing of value to the narrative. Really, it reminds me of the long descriptions that Victorian era literature included. The main difference is that this is worse since it's only thirteen episodes and the time could have easily been put to better use. The chemistry between Horo and Lawrence is really hit and miss. Some moments work others just come off as forced. That being said, there are some interesting ideas and I did really like what they did with the church in this. While there are some boring moments, there are also some really good, tense moments. Unfortunately, those moments tend to get resolved far too quickly and have no apparent impact beyond the immediate. That might be fixed in the second season, but it is an issue with this one. 
Let's move on to the characters. Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional and under-developed. A lot of them even share the same vague motivation, making profit. Lawrence himself is a pretty stock character with very little personality or development. That being said, I loved the character of Horo. Horo gets some great dialogue, she's very interesting and she shows a lot of great development as a character. Spice and Wolf might be worth watching just for Horo. That's how awesome she is. 
The art is really well done. I can certainly see the visual similarities to Strawberry Panic. The various villages are lively and the backgrounds are very well done. The only real issue I had with the art is that the action scenes are kind of boring. They tend to end very quickly with Horo just kind of barreling through everyone. I know that action scenes with wolves can work, I saw Wolf's Rain, they just don't in this. You probably expected me to complain about Horo being shown naked so frequently, but there actually are valid story and character reasons for it, and they refrain from using them for mindless fan-service, mostly, so I didn't really have a problem with it.  
The voice acting is a little bland, but that's probably due largely to the character issues. Most of the characters just don't have any good dialogue so it's not surprising that the voice actors couldn't give their best performances. The only exception is Koshimuzu Ami who gives a very strong performance as Horo. The music is weak, especially the Engrish closing theme.  
The yuri factor is a -/--. There are all of three important female characters and they don't interact that much with each other.  
My final rating for Spice and Wolf is a -/--. It's a decent anime that could have been much better. While there are some good ideas, the writing is weakened by a lot of padding and stilted dialogue. Horo is the only character worth mentioning. Although she is a spectacular character, she can't carry the entire anime by herself.

Kimetsu no Yaiba has recently become a mainstream hit for good reason. The art is beautiful, the story keeps you interested, but what makes it truly special? How has Kimetsu no Yaiba differentiated itself from other Shonen? There are a few key reasons. 
To be the strongest. It's a common driving force or end goal for a Shonen protagonist. They fight to be the strongest, they train to be the strongest, they win to be the strongest. A lot of them have one-liners like ""I will be the Hokage"", ""I will be the Magic Emporer"" and ""I will be the Pirate King"". Most Shonen protagonists strive to be the greatest. Kimetsu no Yaiba keeps the foundation of Shonen such as a hard-headed and hardworking protagonist and reliance on emotion, however, it changes the narrative from ""I will be the strongest"" to ""I will protect my cute demon sister and turn her back into a human no matter what"". To be the strongest is not the answer to everything that comes in the protagonist’s way. It is a breath of fresh air to escape the ""I will be the strongest"" mentality. The protagonist still needs to be strong, but I appreciate not being bombarded with the same one-liners over and over again. 
Kamado Tanjiro is not annoying. Never would I have thought that I would see the day where a protagonist in a Shonen is not an annoying naive brat. He is indeed those things in the start, but the traits quickly fade as he trains and the protaganist-kun comes out as a man rather than a brat. It is once again refreshing, and the story becomes easier to listen to. The side characters, however, are uninteresting and loud. Zenitsu has one or two good moments and made me chuckle but nothing really interesting about any of them yet. 
Nezuko. The amount of times I suffocated due to choking on my breath can not be counted. Every time she does something cute, my heart explodes. Nezuko is a --/--. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba is an all-around joy to watch and I would definitely recommend it.

If your parents give you psychological trauma that makes you a mute, the best recourse is to invite them to a musical about your damaged psyche. At least, that is one of the silly things that this anime portrays. 
The past couple of years, the high school drama/ romance genre has really been booming. Most of them combine pleasant visuals with a traditional story progression that possesses one dramatic twist. Anthem of the Heart checks off both of those categories, but something just seems to get lost in translation for the story and characters. 
Anthem was oh so close to being really good, but contrived story developments and character interactions hindered it. Motivations and actions seem to carry virtually no weight behind them. I understand that it can be difficult to develop weighty narrative in the span of a movie as opposed to a one or two cour series, but Anthem was lacking to an upsetting degree in this respect. As previously mentioned other similar stories put in just enough effort to make characters have a real impact; something that Anthem fell flat at. 
Anthem still receives a relatively good score at - because I thought the art was attractive, the sound was pleasing, and the premise of the story is so good. I can honestly understand why I see that so many people have given it a higher score then myself. It is just easy to compare Anthem to its contemporaries and see where it is sorely lacking.

Howl's Moving Castle is one of my all-time favorites movies, so bear that in mind when reading this review, I'm extremely biased towards giving it a good score. 
Story: -- 
I love the way that Miyazaki writes the stories. He lets the plot progress as he's making it, which can be quite risky, but usually ends with a natural feeling flow to his movies. 
Art: -- 
What's not to love about the Ghibli style? 
Sound: -- 
Dubs aren't always good, the further back you go, but I thought that this one was great. 
Character: -- 
Interesting and enjoyable to watch. 
Enjoyment: -- 
I got into these movies later than normal because usually people have watched these when they were kids and have fond, nostalgic memories of those times. I, however, didn't watch any Ghibli movies when I was a kid, but did see a lot of commercials on VHS. I've got to say, even though I only watched this sometime last year, or so, I'm really loving them.

In an nutshell, the anime kind of sucked. I am strictly speaking of the anime in and of itself, not including any manga, it had no back-story or any background of the plot. The whole harem thing kind of gets really old, it's more annoying than anything else. The character introduction and background were....well really there wasn't any background on the characters at all. The comical side of the anime honestly wasn't that funny. In all, it just felt like a low budget anime. It could of had potential if it was a two tier anime or more.

A lot of the issues season two carries with it were largely already present in season one such as the multiple smaller stories making less interesting ones drag. 
Though when they drag in season two, the drag is more noticeable as season two is less eventful overall than season one. They take on a lot of foreshadowing, but return very little substance and that makes it feel like the series progresses very little by the end of -- episodes. 
That said, the best episodes of the series are from this season so while the season overall is lacking at best with its wild fluctuations in storytelling quality, a few select episodes/arcs are worth watching. (Sorrowful Miracle - which follows up on the events of season one's The Last Wish - and Black Steel were two personal favourites.) 
As for character, I found myself liking certain familiar characters less and other ones more, which surprised me since the main cast developed very little in season two with Kurogane being the only exception. It's probably because most characterizations became static and without anything to move the characters forward, there was very little to be enthusiastic about. 
As for the art and sound, very little changed in terms of quality from season one to season two so if you were fond of season one with these items in mind, you won't be disappointed with season two. 
They still desperately need reference material for fight scenes and fewer panning stills. 
Overall, not the worst, though if you were strongly attached to season one, season two may end up being a disappointing watch.

Review in brief:  The Conqueror of Shamballa attempts to be its own thing when it's a sequel to a show with loose ends and completely fails to succeed as either.  It's almost as though this movie was initially a failed standalone pitch before being shoehorned into FMA as the ---- anime was reaching its end.  As disappointing as FMA '--'s ending was it's far better than anything The Conqueror of Shamballa has to offer. 
**This review assumes you've watched FMA '--.** 
Review in full:  Anyone who finished FMA '-- knows that its ending was just a setup for a sequel.  Aside from the implicative final scene there were still a number of lingering questions regarding specific details from the show that were left unanswered.  This movie serves to end the anime-original storyline, but nothing more.  It has no desire to answer the questions the series left open and instead seeks to stand on its own as the final arc of the story.  This in itself raises serious questions about the validity of its setup (FMA '--'s finale) but considering how much of the series' rules this movie forgets they may as well have just forgotten about what they had done before.  This is especially true when it comes to ""the gate"", the means by which alchemy acquired its energy to function in FMA '--.  The TV show went to great lengths to show that transmutations had a cost (except the last one that got Edward & Envy to Earth, apparently ""the gate"" stopped caring).  Now ""the gate"" arbitrarily lets people switch worlds (either freely or at a cost) so long as they can open it.  The old rules simply don't apply anymore, especially when you consider that a certain event at the movie's end involving ""the gate"" would render alchemy impossible according to the TV show, but the movie doesn't even consider this. 
Even within its own story, this movie features an unending torrent of plot holes & conveniences.  Many of these revolve around characters (and most of the characters at that) doing things not because it fits their presented character or because it's a sensible thing to do but simply because otherwise the plot would not have moved forward.  This wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't the excuse for such events as Edward cheerfully deciding to miss the public unveiling of his past - years of work for a quick snooze because it was apparently the only simple way to set up the next scene, or Fritz Lang using his indestructible ----'s automobile to crash the Beer Hall Putsch (and I do mean crashing into the beer hall where the putsch is just kicking off) because he magically knew Edward would be there, or just about everything Hohenheim does.  The whole movie is like this too, in fact it's difficult to give examples without giving spoilers.  There's more hole than plot and it's not even funny. 
Nearly all of the characters (including the new main characters) are cardboard cutouts who are either only present to push the plot another step or enforce a stereotype because this movie likes to think it has a central message (it very well could have if it had actual characterization and could remember anything it said for more than -- minutes but that is certainly not the case).  The few characters with any meaning to them derive all of it from the TV show, so while Edward has clearly matured since his state alchemist days and Alphonse (Elric, that is) has become bolder (and can fragment his soul to control objects now, no reason given as usual), none of the development is actually shown and rather is just what we're given from the get-go, which means that most of what they do is just set up to push the plot forward as well.  Meanwhile you have characters like the main villain who attacks the people she was supposed to get help from (because how else is someone who leads the antagonists supposed to look evil?) and Maes Hughes who has been reduced to a laughably shallow ""evil nazi"" stereotype. 
It's frustrating considering how little the setting has been tapped into by general media.  Weimar Republic Germany was a time of wild uncertainty with revolts and movements of just about every kind that would have been possible during the Interwar period.  Many of the important events and people associated with World War II were already set in place during this time, and Germany was at the center of it all.  The Conqueror of Shamballa does tap into its setting (though events revolving around ""the gate"" and the antagonist Thule Society are the main focus) and provides an interesting (though hard to believe, mostly due to poor execution) theory regarding the Beer Hall Putsch.  The problem is that it has nothing to do with Fullmetal Alchemist and would have likely worked much better as a fully separate entity.  What few elements that were brought over from FMA almost all appear shoehorned in to remind the viewer that this is in fact a FMA sequel and certainly not something completely different.  FMA's world could have been swapped out with any other fantasy world without any other change. 
Finally, this also isn't a movie that features worthwhile production values. The sound is merely alright with passable music, forgettable effects, and (in Japanese anyhow) voice-work that only could have gone as far as the flat characters who were speaking to begin with.  While the animation quality is generally slightly better than the TV show it also features highly dated CGI and plenty of stilted moments. There's definitely worse but there's something to be said when a ---- movie can't truly improve over a ------- multi-cour TV series. 
Verdict:  It's the FMA '-- finale and it has so little to do with FMA that it's painful.  If you want a sequel that cleanly ends FMA '-- rest unassured that there are no answers, just holes.  If you want a good standalone movie set in the Weimar Republic then I regret to inform you that you won't find it here.  Those are the only two things this movie attempted to be.  You can skip this movie without missing anything worthwhile, in fact I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding it.

The ""Magi"" series is highly ranked here on MAL, and I definitely understand why. It has a unique style and manages to combine sweet moments, great action, fantastic adventures, mystery, character development and world building in a amazing way. Biased as a may be, I´ill do my best to be as objective and constructive as possible in my review of ""Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic"". The score is for the show as a piece of all the seasons + ""up to date manga"", do to that I try to see how good the piece in the puzzle works. And I think it works really well. Well let´s dig in! 
Story: --/-- 
Loosely based on the ""---- and one night"" characters and Arabic mythology, we have a pretty unique anime/manga setting. But this is not a copy work - when I say loosely based I mean very loosely. The world is completely fantasy, with it´s own continents, lands, empires, djinns, dungeons and magic. Not only have we Arabic influences but also Chinese (The Koh Empire), roman (The Rem Empire), Mongolian (The Mountain Horse tribes) and so on. That makes up for a chessboard of many different agendas and conflicts. 
One thing you should know, that the first -- or so episodes aren´t that action packed. So if you are going in to this one because of the action tag - you will have to wait a bit for the action to really get going. I´m not saying the first bit doesn´t contain action - it´s just not in the focus yet. And when the real action is brought into the mix, well let´s say it´s really good, much because of the suspense and tension that has been building up right to that point. Most battles are magic based which gives us some epic showdowns. The first part of the story are mainly focused on introducing and getting to know the characters (and it´s quite a few), lay out the main plot and on world building. The show many times has a sweet and adorable touch to it, that makes the more intense, dark and emotional aspects of the show more highlighted (at least for me). ""Magi"" is equally character and plot driven in my opinion - the two bears one another very well. What I mean is that characters develops much to the plot, and that the many great characters really makes the story shine (don´t know how else to put it).  
In ""Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic"" we are introduced the concepts of the dungeons, djinns and what´s happen when you capture them, the main characters meeting and growing friendship, the Magi´s (their origin will be much of a mystery until the third season) and the kings candidates, the political power struggles within and between different empires and kingdoms, and the growth and development of the main characters (Alibaba, Aladdin and Morgiana). The magic aspects of the show is actually very well thought throw, and given time explained in detail (more so in ""Magi:The Kingdom of magic""). And I like the fact that just because someone gained a djinn they are not automatically over powered - it dosen´t work like that, the users have to train really hard to master their djinns powers. The same goes for the magic users and fanalis (a race of crazy strong people - Morgiana is one of them), which leaves room for the character to really grow and believable become stronger and face difficulties in a realistic way. That together with the dungeon capturing, really fills out the ""Adventure"" label in a great way. The show lays a heavy weight on the strength of friendship, the cost of freedom and making the right decision, and that nothing comes for free - you have to fight for what you believe in. Something I really appreciate with the show is that it doesn´t simplify situations - every choice the character has to make has consequences. This is not the type of show that settle all matters with just one battle, and everybody´s happy and goes home. No, each choice of action is followed up with some realistic consequences. The political systems and hierarchy is as complicated and detailed as in our world. This adds to a very nice world building - you really get a since of how it works and the logic behind it. I think that was awesome, it brought a lot of the depth to the story. 
You also should have in mined that this in the end is gonna be a long running show (--- or so episodes), so ""Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic"" is the beginning of this great adventure. Another thing is that this show has a heavy focus on the impotence of friendship, so if you not dig themes like that you may have problem with it. I personally think their friendship are great, and that many people out there should learn from them.  
Art: --/-- 
The art is in my opinion freaking great. A-- Pictures is behind ""Magi"" and have done a absolutely outstanding job with it. Not only have they stayed true to the manga´s art, but also really brought it to life. The colors are strong and vibrant, the motions is fluid, the light setting gorgeous, and the character are well designed with personal traits. Ooh the colors... Not only are the bright colors used on the characters, but in every panel (backgrounds, magic etc.). Everything from the hair colors (Morginas bright pink, Aladdins intense blue and Sinbads dark purple) to vivid towns and sun settings - is absolutely beautiful. The backgrounds are all very detailed and fits the story and it´s characters brilliantly. The thing with the characters is that they have a unique look to them, so you instantly now that this is a character from Magi. No paper-cut boards from anywhere. The magic and action scenes are really well done - they are all very fluid with nice angles and motions. I especially enjoyed Morgianas fight scenes, her fighting technique is awesome on screen. The best thing with the animation for me was the ""ruugh"" scenes. They really amplifies the mystic of the magic and are right down awesome - you have to see them for yourself, they are gorgeous. And the art is deliberately goofy in the more comical moments - it is supposed to be that way. All over I´m really pleased with the art and animation, I have no complaints what so ever with it. Keep up the good work for the next season! 
Sound: --/-- 
Yep, yet again a --. And I´m very serious when it comes to the music in a show. Displeasing or unfitting music can easily ruin a show for me. But I absolutely love the soundtrack for ""Magi"". It´s suiting, well coordinated and are managing to bring out the emotions that the scenes was meant to create - brilliant. For the more action oriented scenes we have rock music, often with vocals. The songs are really great - I still listen to them, it still makes my heart pump faster (for example ""Enfin apparu!!"", ""A storm is coming for us all"" and ""Vasle Hot""). For the more easy going moments we have more goofy-happy music and for some emotional moments we have some dramatic classical music with a ""Magi-feeling"" to it (you will know what I mean). And of course we have some Arabic influenced music, they are all great (I espacially enjoyed the song Morgiana dances to, when she´s finally able to let her self be happy and feel her freedom - they totally nailed that one).  
For the the two OP´s, I can say really liked them as well. They are catchy, fast going and vibrant with a happy undertone - perfectly for this kind of colorful adventure story. Together with some nice visuals they set the perfect ""Magi""-mood, and letting you get reminded of that you are in for a ride. As for The ED´s I wasn´t a fan of the first one (a bit to edgy for me), but I liked the visuals. For the second ED I really liked it. Up beat with a sad/dramatic undertone, It really hit home to me.  
Character: --/-- 
The -- is raining down on ""Magi"" from me. But as for the rest I do have my reasons. The first thing is that I can really feel the characters personalities, and that they seldom do things that is out of character for them. There is no overdone arch/stereotypes or --denominational characters in ""Magi"". They have distinct believable personalities that doesn´t feel unrealistic or overdone. Their past has of course made them who they are, but it doesn´t stop there. For a show that has so many different and colorful characters, they all feel needed and have a role to fill in some way. The character development is quite frank outstanding - especially for our three mains (Aladdin, Alibaba and Morgiana) in this season. The characters learn from each mistake, each hardship and each adventure. They think and reflect, and it´s making them grow at a very high rate - but they never loses their personalities. Which I think is great, the main trio compliments each other very well. They have a great dynamic that always progresses forward. Even the ""enemies"" are strong characters with motives, and their own view on the world. You seldom find a character in ""Magi"", with the only reason to act like they do because they are evil. They always have an agenda or reason - even if it is a simple one or one to be uncovered later. We get to follow a lot of plot important characters, so keep your eyes open - conversations and such between new faces that can appear to be random, are often not. It´s giving away clues to the plot and the characters role in it.  
It´s hard to really lift my points on why I loved all the characters in ""Magi"" so much without spoiling anything. So I leave it at that so can you see for your self. 
Enjoyment: --/-- 
I enjoyed every second of ""Magi"". Everything from the interesting plot, awesome characters, fantastic music and brilliant animation. One of my favorite shows so far, and I don´t think that´s ever gonna change. I base a lot of final scores on all over enjoyment despite flaws and such, but in ""Magi´s"" case I can´t fined any such things. Every piece that´s makes a great anime for me was there. Enjoyment is a understatement - It´s was an unforgettable experience for me. Loved every second of it. I laughed, I cried, I was exited, and I was intrigued when I was watching this. It fore shore left me emotionally touched and eager to jump on the next season. Just how I wan´t a show to make me feel.  
Overall: --/-- 
Great storytelling, world building, characters and animation has put the Magi series up in the top, and it really deserves it. It has an unique feeling to it - I call it the ""Magi"" feeling. Nothing feels like a cheap copy of something else, the usual tropes are absent, and the characters has real depth. Not to mention that it´s actually containing some well fitted comedy. Magi definitely fills out it´s labels in interesting content and lives up to it´s high scores ( I personally think it´s deserve even a better one). I can´t freaking wait for season -, it´s enough source material out now so it should be expected in a year or two. If you are in to adventure story´s in a fantasy environment with a healthy does of action and magic, well this fore shore the show for you.

Art: Terrible, this Anime was made in ----. Main character designs were terrible. Animation greatly improved on the last episode. Shame on production group. 
Sound: Decent OP and ED, placement of sound did not help at all with the storyline. See various instances, ep x and ep x. Let's have suspenseful music on a lovely lovely scene.  
Character: Never have I seen side characters I could care less for. Two main characters have some instance of hope later on during the series with slight character development. (after ep -) 
Enjoyment: I would not recommend this anime to friends, family, but to hardcore romance Anime fans, enjoy, you have found a good waste of time here. 
Overall: Watch if you are bored as hell, otherwise choose from other Anime that have well defined storyline, character development and and coherent to the plotline. If this Anime was a paper, it would be given a C.

I loved New Game! because it was a relentlessly-positive experience that oozed joy in every episode. NG!! starts strong, but halfway through, when the two new characters are introduced, it tanks hard. Everything becomes more serious, more dramatic, and less fun to watch.  
It's the same trap --% of comedies fall into: they start with hilarious jokes and great vibes, but then halfway through the small seeps turn into gushing floods of needless melodrama that overwhelmingly destroy the lightheartedness. I thought the first series was incredible because it's so rare to maintain cheery atmosphere without being sunk by crap; NG!! fails in this regard. 
The two new main characters are total bitches. I knew from the start that they would have their ""reasons"" for being bitchy, and they did come at the very end, but for --- episodes the two of them dragged every scene down with their negative attitudes. It completely spoiled what made NG! a fantastic experience. Not to mention, the final episode is a complete drama-dump of feels, and while I did believe it was genuine (and it was written fine), it just completely ruined the entire second series. 
The tone shift from series one to series two was a huge mistake.

Welcome to the world of light novel adaptations, where everything needs to be revolving around some boring guy surrounded by hot chicks who want his weenie. 
The premise is about a young man who is looking for the killer of his family. In this setting, it is common for scientists to create automatons to control in battles. Thus, after he creates his own death machine, he learns about the whereabouts of the killer and heads to get his revenge. 
I made it sound interesting; didn’t I? It’s all about the way you present it and sadly for the audience the premise is ruined by the usual tropes that light novels are filled with. So allow me to rewrite the above; this time on how it is actually presented. 
The premise is about a generic shonen lead whose purpose in life is described in one line. In this setting, it is common for people with random superpowers to create waifus. Thus, after he creates his own sex doll, he enrols in a school and begins to create his harem. 
Doesn’t sound so well now; does it? Well that is the harsh reality and if one needs to hope of enjoying this show, he should lower his bar a few centimetres away from the ground. The plot is basically random missions where the lead is showing off his hax superpowers, seduces girls, and then has sex with his doll, which is one of the biggest anime sluts you can ever hope to encounter in a non-hentai title. The damn thing is a nympho and can’t stop craving for more sex with the only person she cares for. Every episode will feature at least - scenes where she is naked and rubs herself on the lead, who of course acts like he is about to be murdered. And then there will be at least a couple of more scenes where she is jealous of him talking to other girls and resorting to all sorts of deviant fetishes in order to attract his attention. The show will desperately try to excuse that as a “normal” fascination of a robot towards its creator. Plus all the sex scenes are “supposed” to be about a robot recharging its batteries by plugging into its energy source, which so happens to be its creator. And we are supposed to actually believe that... 
So as you can imagine there is very little time left to actually offer some sort of plot other than softporn nonsense. The whole revenge business is just an excuse for the lead to be doing something other than orgies with super hot babes who fall for his boring personality. There are for example some side stories where one of the girls has a very heavy duty to fulfil, or her pet dragon is accused of being a savage beast. They are supposed to build drama and tension but good luck doing that when they are kicked to the side every - minutes for some overdone ecchi scene you can find in any harem show out there. Hell, even the guy the lead want to kill, the part which is supposed to be the most serious one, is controlling several automatons, and they are all (SURPRISE) also sex dolls. 
Not that it would make much difference in saving this wreck of a series, but even the production values are that good. The animation is done by a minor studio which seems to like erasing outlines to the point shapes seem to blur and tire the average eye. The colouring of the skins seems to be too pink or brown and with the simplistic look everybody is drawn you end up looking at a bunch of shapes that are supposed to make up a human being. And no, that is hardly artistic or appealing. As for the music, it is barely something you will care to pay attention to. 
So there you go, yet another show that is just forgettable fan service instead of ... you know, something worth of your time? Perhaps a story about revenge and existentialism regarding the value of human lives in a world where people can be manufactured? Straight up hentai? A dating simulation? Anything besides this wreck.

Overlord is the kind of anime you begin watching with some reservations. 
""A popular MMORPG game traps its players inside and the players now have to play the game where the consequences are quite real"".  
Sounds familiar?  
Well, that's exactly what happens in Overlord, however, the advantage with me is that I haven't seen shows like Sword Art Online, so while the plot was known to me the inherent flaws and stereotypes were not. The show quickly sets itself apart from its contemporaries by giving us a protagonist who plays the role of an antagonist and loves it.  
After a brief period of confusion, the ease with which Ainz/Momon takes charge of his servants and powers is refreshing to see. Every move he makes defines his character as a person who is a veteran of MMORPG games. And while he uses his tactics as he would in a game, he knows the consequences of his actions and accepts them without hesitation.  
The Art and Music of the show compliment each other brilliantly, and the characters are a good mix of perverse, lovable and obedient. If you've ever had a dream of ruling your own world, then this show will make an excellent guide.

I expected to like this show, but given how very different its arcs were, it manages to do good on some, and just outright disappoint on others. I'll try to cover most of my issues and what I liked without going too much into spoilers. 
The story takes place in a world where people cannot be born, nor can die. Given how unique the setting is, it's bound to be interesting, but they immediately raise a problem to it. Characters can still die, but they live on as ""undead"" until buried by gravekeepers. The issue here is there is no remarkable difference between the living and the undead, so I could not see why there was so much discrimination between them. I think the only defining factor is that the undead cannot age, but other than that, they look completely alive. The first arc does well, I liked its characters, and was shocked by a certain twist at its end. Moving on to the second one, it mainly encompasses living and undead as I mentioned before and adds silly plot points with an abruptly stupid ending which I won't go into to avoid spoilers. Third arc is basically meaningless and just as a setup to introduce the characters of the last arc. Before the last arc, we get kind of an interlude which tries to develop Scar, but they kind of just pushed her into an unnecessary situation just for development. The final arc reminded me of my favorite light novel, HakoMari, with its plot being really similar to its first volume, except handled much worse. It was going pretty well with the explanations given to the situation until the ending which tried to offer a plot twist, but that twist contradicted all prior explanations, albeit being a bit surprising, but the annoyance factor outweighs the surprise factor. Basically a story full of ups and a lot of downs, and could have been rated at least a - if it covered its plotholes. 
The art is well colored and drawn as evident in the PV and wallpaper, but the character designs seem like your generic loli girl and bishounens. It didn't really bother me but at times you can predict their personalities from their looks, which was kind of disappointing to see how they exactly follow that character trope. Sound design was nice and warm and fit the moments in the show. Hampnie was pretty much the only character I liked, I have an appeal towards Alice too but not too much, and I'm neutral toward anyone else. As I mentioned, their looks gave away their bland personalities, except for these - characters. 
Overall, I expected more from a show with blatantly obvious plotholes that ignores them so casually. Covering up these plotholes would make this show watchable, but at this rate, don't bother.

I'm so glad I didn't give up on this series.  
It's been getting some great reviews so I thought I should see what the fuss was about. At first I didn't understand what all the hype was about. I watched the first couple episodes and got bored with it. I stopped watching it for weeks. Every once in a while I would watch another episode just to try and get the feel of the story.  
I was supposed to give up on this show entirely but I decided to give it another chance. I had a Nagi no Asukara marathon from episode four. I have to say, it's one of the most beautiful stories out there. Sure there are a lot of angst and the characters can be quite annoying. But as a whole, it's a beautiful beautiful story.  
From different kinds of people being able to put their differences aside and get along to showing how to give love to someone unconditionally.  
It's about community, family, friendship and romance.  
All of the characters have depth, even the supporting ones. The people in the community all feel so present. Usually in anime they are there to serve as a background for the main characters. Not in here. In Nagi no Asukara they play a huge part in the story.  
Even though the relationship of the main characters is like a tangled web somehow it worked out in the end. Somehow, it made sense and it felt right in the last episode. None of it felt forced.  
Let me just say that the Sea God and Ojoshi-sama's story is really heart breaking. I felt sad for Uroko-sama.  
Finally, I don't know any more. I wanted to cry after I finished the last episode. I'm glad that the anime had a proper ending. I'm glad that I pushed through with it or else I might have missed a really amazing anime. All -- episodes are full of emotions and it draws the viewers in and make them empathize with the characters. I can't remember how many times I cried while watching. Actually, I'm writing this review because I have so much emotions right now and I can't really express it.

“Lovely Complex” is the definition of a romantic comedy dome right. For its time, I really have to say that the comedic duo trope works well here. You don’t always see these types of things landing in today’s anime, and I sometimes miss that when I see shows like this. From the voice acting to the chemistry being shown from Otani and Risa, I think the progression between how these two students feel towards another was very detailed and balanced. Even the hilarious moments between them shined through, especially during the classic concert scene where Risa really tells Otani how she feels about him. The back and forth between them really makes the show feel more like a classic slice of life comedy rather than just your typical school crush romance, and I honestly had no issue for that. 
The reason, though, that I have to give this an - instead of a -, was because I wish there was an OVA for this show that would give more insight towards the personal lives that Risa and Otani had — like what life is really like for Risa living as a tall girl growing up, to Otani dealing with the jokes that he gets for being short. Also, I personally didn’t think the supporting characters didn’t stick out to me much, especially with the trap character who seemed funny in the first half of the show, but slowly started to lose steam during the second half. If anything, I think this show is still great and it really does hold up almost ten plus years later.

NANA is a regrettably incomplete work. It takes viewers on a journey with an intriguing destination, aggravates them with rocky bumps along the way, and then unceremoniously abandons them on the roadside in the middle of nowhere. The story unfolds in reasonably entertaining ways but is too frequently hamstrung by inadequate build and progression with regard to many core characters, and when combined with the abrupt conclusion to the series, bewildered viewers at the very end may be asking themselves, ""Huh? That's it?"", as they lament over NANA's wasted potential and wonder what could have been. 
From the opening narration, NANA teases a mysterious endgame that immediately hooks viewers. The titular characters, Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu, and their respective origins are then introduced with a delightful blend of comedy and drama in the handful of episodes that follow, and viewers become increasingly eager to see them begin their new lives together in Tokyo. As more people enter their lives throughout the course of the series, the two Nanas progressively encounter more problems, and incidentally, the show itself does, as well. 
NANA spreads itself too thin in juggling its multitude of characters. Consequently, many key players in the show are insufficiently characterized, and their relationships are woefully underdeveloped. This manifests in various problematic ways throughout the entire run of the series. For starters, certain characters seemingly change on a whim, ever malleable to the demands of the story. Romantic relationships between certain characters, too, blossom and wither at the drop of a hat. Similarly, the degree of closeness of certain friendships, particularly that of the titular characters, comes across as highly implausible. 
All of that can be traced back to one fundamental issue: viewers are expected to take too much on faith alone. When new and important facets of certain characters are revealed with no natural progression or even minimal foreshadowing, viewers must instantly believe that the most recent iteration of a character is the truest one, despite the dearth of any supporting evidence up to that point. When certain characters effortlessly fall in and out of love with no meaningful build-up, viewers are often simply told but rarely actually shown of how that love came to be and why it crumbled. When the titular characters implicitly and explicitly swear their eternal friendship, viewers are encouraged not to question that friendship because when viewers take into consideration only what they have seen--the occasional meals together, the band practice hangouts, a live concert outing, and a pair of strawberry drinking glasses--they realize that there is hardly anything of substance that would suggest that the two Nanas are inseparable soulmates. Friendly roommates? Sure. Good friends? Believable. Life partners? Unlikely. Whatever intense bond that they purportedly forged over the course of a mere six months must have certainly occurred off-screen, and like with everything else, viewers must accept it on faith. 
Moreover, NANA's failure to tell a self-contained story in -- episodes is inexcusable. NANA effectively ends in the middle of a story arc, making the ending a quintessential ""go-read-the-manga"" ending at its absolute worst. Considering that the publication of the source material was still ongoing at the time of the show's airing, the absence of a decisive conclusion to the entire story is, of course, understandable. However, what is not understandable is the total omission of a finale that is at least narratively logical with respect to only the ---episode run. Not all loose ends need to be tied up, but enough loose ends certainly do in order to ensure a rewarding viewing experience. As it is, unsatisfied viewers must consult the source material, at least to a limited degree (note: the manga is on hiatus at the time of writing and has been since ----), to obtain some sense of closure and to validate their time and emotions invested in the show. 
Much as the titular characters ponder where things went wrong for them throughout the series, viewers are ultimately left to mull over the same about the series itself. Perhaps a tighter focus placed on a smaller cast of characters could have saved it. Perhaps a greater importance placed on organic character development could have helped. Perhaps a note-perfect conclusion could have mitigated the impact of all other flaws. In any case, the show that started off with such a remarkable bang provides no worthwhile payoff and finishes with a disappointing whimper, leaving unfulfilled viewers with many of the same questions in the end as they had in the beginning.

This review covers both seasons of Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf) 
Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf) was one of the most boring anime I have seen.It is without question the most tedious anime I've watched since I got back into anime three years ago. 
The show does have its positives; first off I love the art style of the show and for a show that came out over a decade ago the animation is pretty solid. I like the premise of the show and the two main characters Holo and Lawrence, who do have a solid dynamic.  
There are a few funny moments in the show and some of the drama worked. 
Also I enjoyed the first arc of the second season. 
The show was regarded as one of the best fantasy, romance adventure anime of all time and it lacked in all three areas.  
The main problem I have with Spice and Wolf is the pace. Across two seasons there are only -- episodes but the pace is so slow that it felt like I was watching --- episodes. The slow pace of the show made it tiring to sit through and I remember feeling so board out of my mind I asked myself why I was still watching.  
I understand that romantic dramas usually have a show pace however, compared to works such as Titanic or Game of Thrones before season - the difference is vast. This is due to the characters, while I enjoyed the dynamic of Holo and Lawrence I was never invested in anything they did on screen.  
The initial premise of the show was nothing out of the ordinary but it completely falls off the rails and has no real payoff. Most of the side characters are completely forgettable and feel more like fodder to fill time.  
The show predominantly focuses on political/business based dialogue, but the dialogue is generic and does not engage the audience. The dialogue is also repetitive to a ridiculous degree. 
I did not have any emotional investment in most of what happened on screen. 
The musical score was mostly forgettable; I do not remember a single theme or song from the show.  
I know that Spice and Wolf is beloved by many anime fans but this show just feel flat. This show lacked in a lot of areas. The romance was never capitalized on, the fantasy is practically non existent and this was by no means an adventure. 
Overall, Spice and Wolf is the worst anime I have seen this year and I do not recommend watching it. I finished the show about a month ago and have not rewatched a single clip of the show.

Spoilers ahead, I suppose. Discretion advised.  
__________________________ 
What a shame, indeed.  
I get it. The show is about manliness, manic (to the point of suicidal) intentions overcoming the limitations of the universe, parodying the mecha genre and its inherently dark undertones, the innate sense of humanity having the capacity to deal with all the problems that it confronts, the ability to grit one's teeth and tell the world that they are not going to bring them down, so on and so forth. I also understand that you cannot think too hard about what you are seeing on screen: when robots the size of whole galaxies (inexplicably) show up, wondering how they don't take millions of years just to take their next step is the last thing you are supposed to think about.  
There are those I respect from whom I heard this show was good. No, the actual words were, ""this anime is a key to my creative abilities"". Given how envious I am of their abilities, I eagerly watched this show. Simon, a boy without a future. Kamina, the man who knows the right words but not the right sense. They become brothers after Simon realises that Kamina has a dream that he can get behind and drill. Fine. The world is keeping them down, so they will first rebel against their village and its narrow ways. Of course, they do not succeed, but they aren't disappointed because, the very next day, everything comes crashing down, starting with a giant robot that has no intention beyond generally causing mayhem, and a teenager named Yoko who wears that ridiculous attire in the name of mobility and comfort. Their world has been a lie, and Kamina is the most satisfied of the bunch, because he can now finally believe in his own memories. So far, so good. 
The show progresses and you get caught along with the characters. Then more characters show up. ""O...kay"", I said, ""I suppose this is fine"". They make a pit-stop at ""moral ambiguity village"" where they are treated as gods, because they fell down from the sky, but leave without any real conflict of beliefs. And I realised something was off. Nothing was gained in terms of conviction; they simply chose not to deal with the potential conflict at all. Hmm. 
Alright. We have a big fight on our hands. But then something bad happens (to only one person among everyone involved in the fighting), and the whole thing grinds to a halt. ""Well, that is what you get for tempting fate all this time, right?"" I blurt out. But, wait, what are these emotions doing here? Remorse? Despair? Impotence (you know, lack of ""manly spirit"" and all that)? Before they can take their toll on the show, Nia shows up, left to die in a sealed coffin (but, somehow, assigned a caretaker, who didn't bother to show up when she was left to die while seemingly wanting to get the protagonists killed earlier in the show). She holds the show back, making sure that it doesn't go the same way Evangelion went, because letting the small things get in the way will kill the momentum. Nia gives the show the dose of morphine that pushes it on until the first half is complete. 
Then the second half begins. An ominous cloud looms over everyone. Humans have become a prosperous species within just seven years (that is not how humans work, but the show didn't care and it isn't going to start now). Rossiu, Simon's partner and the erstwhile apprentice of the priest of ""moral ambiguity village"", is now starting to darken the mood. Sewage problems, perception of the government he is running, maintaining order. The old guard is completely dumbfounded: they are fighters, not bureaucrats. Simon is apparently at peace, for he ""saved"" the world, but when the Anti-Spirals, opposed to the use of the Spiral Energy that Simon exhibits most brilliantly, attack the Earth, everyone turns on Simon for being himself. Nia is pulled away, with the show making up a new character motivation for her, like it did in the past with her caretaker. Of course, here, Rossiu becomes the centre- having to take decisions he was afraid of taking but ready to accept what must follow. Honestly, this was the closest the show came to becoming interesting: what are the consequences of believing in yourself when not everyone agrees with your methods? Simon never understood this and he almost becomes the ceremonial scapegoat that would be sacrificed for the well-being of Rossiu's government. Of course, another contrivance prevents this, and the show is back on track with its attempts at embarrassing itself with each passing episode.  
The show explains that Spiral Energy is a metaphor for the fighting spirit in general and the evolutionary drive which moves all living organisms. The spiralling drill is represented in the double helix of the DNA, changing and constantly bettering itself. The Anti-Spirals believe that this energy will bring about the end of the universe because of something called the Spiral Nemesis, a prophesied (""prophesied"", ""predicted"", it doesn't make a difference) end-state of the universe when Spiral Energy grows bigger and bigger in each organism that evolves to the point where the organisms begin violating the law of conservation of mass and a black hole sucks up all of existence. I wish that I didn't know half as much as I did about astrophysics and evolution as I did when I watched this show, because all I wanted to do when I heard this explanation was to sit in a corner and cry. 
I was left wondering what the people I had admired saw in the show. The women never had any real reason to come into conflict with the men after they became significant others- the definition of an idealised relationship. That is why Yoko and Simon could not live their lives with the ones they loved. The whiplash of moving from the first to the second season, only to be told that none of that matters- the definition of a cop-out. The show didn't want to deal with the issues it raises, just move past it.  
The juvenile beliefs that thoughtless bravado can accomplish anything is so much easier to swallow when the people dying have not been important all this time and that harebrained schemes work better than any well-thought out plans that might fail was enough to make me yell angrily at the show, because I had realised that there was nothing that I could get from this. People will continue to appreciate this show and speak about how it stands as an epitome of manliness, testosterone, hope, and whatever else they think will get them to stop thinking about their depressing lives. Fine.  
I'm not saying that the show needed to be realistic. What I'm saying is, if Evangelion represents depression, this represents mania. Not the mild kind which gives a person all sorts of ideas to keep pushing and do a lot more than they previously could, but the kind that can lead to the hospitalisation of both the person who is suffering from it and the people surrounding this person. This is neither a children's story, nor a story many can connect with unless they have separated themselves from reality to a significant enough degree: Kamina's and Simon's manliness-laden nonsense are used by megalomaniacs with cults of personalities in our world. You listen to them because they stop you from feeling bad about what you could have done, just so long as you sacrifice yourself to their dream. ""There is a better tomorrow"" should not be coming out of the mouths of men who have taken over the responsibility of being the only grown-ups in the world, while they themselves have no real understanding of the losses grown-ups have to deal with.  
I got up from my chair and got out of my room. ""This show wasn't for you,"" they'd say. I sighed. I had lost something that I did not expect to- a sense of stability. What does creativity mean at all? Is this what they, the ones I respect, used to fuel their imaginations that I was in awe of? I had no answer. I closed my eyes, felt a strange discomfort flood my chest, and, realising what this was, I ran to the toilet and let my breakfast come back out of my mouth. I saw the pieces of bread, the half-digested buns of rice among the yellowish brown and I closed my eyes, trying not to remember what I saw throughout the series. I hurled again, and I felt okay.  
Having written this, I feel a lot better.

Out of the - movies of the ""Garden of Sinners"" series, this is my personal favorite. It combines all the best aspects of the series in one complete package in terms of a well-scripted plot, art direction and atmosphere. The editing and visual imagery consist of some of the most imaginative and compelling of this series, or of any other. 
The plot revolves around the mystery of an apartment complex that represents more than just a place for people to live...and die. What happens there to its residents is the motif of the movie, specifically from the point of view of one young man who is essentially the ""protagonist"" in this story. Since this is the -th movie of this franchise, I will assume the reader will already be aware of the background behind the major characters and overall story. 
The strengths of this movie, as well as the series overall, reside in the atmosphere and art design--the artwork beautifully sets the tone and mood of the storytelling. When action breaks out, the animation is suitably fluid as well, but the real highlights are the use of color, light and dark. There are shots that echo the masterful lighting used by Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut to symbolize psychological spaces. The non-linear editing is also a hallmark of the ""Garden of Sinners"" franchise and it is used to the best effect here, complementing the sense of unease and mental confusion that the characters must be feeling. Time, slices of time, the passage of time, and the cycle of time are an essential theme of this movie and the editing is used to great effect to show this.  
In anime and other stories of the floating world, the Japanese have a fascination with appreciating the moments in life that make life mean something--not in transcendental fireworks but in the periods of time where human activity occurs: waking and sleeping, eating, the clink of utensils on dishes, getting dressed, greeting and goodbye--in other words, the rituals of daily living on this tragic mortal coil. The paradox that the magical thinkers such as Araya try to plumb, studying this mechanical cycle, dissecting it and trying to tease out what makes the whole thing tick...this is the essential mystery that the movie itself is trying to depict. Perhaps the best answer any of us can give is to simply plead, ""I was here."" 
Similar to other famous TYPE-MOON franchise, the Fate series, the central themes revolve around existential questions about the human condition in a corrupted universe populated with a unique fusion of Eastern and Western mysticism (Buddhism, Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism plus various magical conventions of mystic circles, runes, spirits, fairies, etc.) that seems to be the hallmark of the creator, Nasu Kinoko. As such, Majun Rasen represents the tightest, well-crafted entry into this universe I've seen so far.

I dont know what to say about this anime adaptation, I have just too many mixed feelings about this, on one hand I believe naruto's plot is esentially the most amazing plot ever but I MUST give the story a - just becuse of the filler episodes which werent all that awful, I did like like.. -? out of what? ---? they are awful, for real the worst torture ever was to wait every week for a new chapter just to get a filler episode.. I skipped --% of them and I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to see them, they are a waste of time, so you can just go to wikipedia, locate those filler episodes and skip them. Filler episodes are just like naruto's movies; too under quality compared to the actual plot episodes. 
For the art, this DESERVES a -. Why on earth would anyone let this mediocre studio get the anime adapation of such a masterpiece? come on, I did laugh at the art on most chapters but that shouldn't be the point.. compared to the manga and from a real fan who has followed naruto for -- years literally the art makes you wanna cry. I personally can't stand bad art animes but I did stand naruto's only because of its overall masterpiece storyline (that's a good point somehow I guess) 
Sound is amazing, it has the best sountrack in matter of openings and endings to me at least, I do love them all and they all make me feel really emotional, the ost is also nice, it gets you into the ninja atmposphere, it's really accurate. 
Naruto has one of the most wonderful characters ever made. Its length also gives space for these characters to be amazingly good developed, in my opinion naruto's characters are the best part from the whole anime adaptation/manga. Chapters dedicated to them actually make you understand even the bad ones and you may be able to love most of them, with all their individual storylines which are outstanding. Best character development out of all anime industry in my opinion. 
It has an awful end which I'm not gonna spoil and that's the only reason I give it an overall - instead of a -- (even when considering art and filler episodes I should probably be harsher) just because its good stuff is just too good. ---% recommend watching, just skip filler episodes and don't expect a thing out of the art.

If you're looking for an anime with romance and relationships, this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for an anime with endless hilarity and gags that runs off love and romance, this is what you're looking for. This anime thrives off misjudgments and the characters.  
Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is an anime thats been the laughing central of this summer. With the theme of manga-artists becoming more popular lately such as, Manga-ka to assistant-san or mangirl ,it's becoming much more attractive and interesting to watch. This is a gem that's becoming popular due to its laughable characters and misinterpretations that occur all the time. 
The story follows Sakura, a girl who tries to tell her crush that she likes him, but gets misinterpreted and ends up becoming his assistant. She often tries to get closer to him, but always gets misjudged and makes for some hilarious comedy. The story follows their life at school along with some other cast members to make the show enjoyable and a lot more entertaining to watch as a whole. With the running gag of it being comedy, some things may seem predictable, but it still stays original and has comedy in every episoded. 
The characters are all really unique in their own way and is the strongest part of the show. With all the different characters you get hilarious situations that really makes the show stand out from the rest that's airing and one that takes comedy to the next level with their personalities.  
You have Sakura, a girl who tries often to get close to her crush, but is always misinterpreted. She's a great person who makes the show better with her retorts and delusions that she thinks is going to happen, but the exact opposite happens. Over time she develops a bond with Nozaki and really makes for some friendship and gave a light feeling to make you smile at every scene. 
Second you have Nozaki, a manga artist and one that people often misjudge. Since he stays up to draw and produce manga, he looks like he gets into fights, but really is only just aches and pains from the constant drawing and late nights. He's oblivious to Sakura's feelings and really makes up for some hilarious reactions that he gives to what he thinks she's doing.  
The art style is nothing new to the ---- style, yet brings out details that makes it better than some of the anime airing. With all the details in the characters clothes, to the beautiful scenery that they go through in their situations, it brings out a sense of comedy to support the bickering and the interactions between all the characters. With the art being one of the strong points, you have beautiful details in every aspect that they bring to the table. The characters all have unique features and traits that belong to them and wonderful backdrops such as the school, or just at their house. 
The opening is nothing to be praised for, but is super catchy. The background music for this anime is one that supports the mood that the anime gives off perfectly. The opening and ending gives off the perfect feeling to start every episode and is one that I never skip. The voice actors are all really well and give the characters life to make the anime as enjoyable as possible. The voice actor for Sakura is relatively new to voice acting, but does a wonderful job portraying her character and is one of the best in the show.  
Overall this anime is one of the best of Summer ---- line up and is definitely worth watching. With it's wonderful characters and hilarious situations they get themselves into, this is one that brings out the comedy in the simplest things. You have the standard ---- art style, yet it makes it better by adding details to make every quality shine and make it so everything stands out to the fullest. The OST is wonderful and support each scene perfectly and the opening is so catchy that you just can't help but enjoy listening to. I recommend anyone who didn't check this out yet to start watching it.

While I enjoyed the show and was drawn to it by the interesting idea of space exploration at the begaining, it quickly lost it's appeal for. What keep me drawn in was the character interatactions and character development. The story was not amazing and had plot holes, but it was fair and alright if you don't think about it too much. There were a few cringe parts that annoyed me in the middle of the show, but the ending felt very wholesome and nice for me. Paired with the nice likeable characters and good art + sounds, I'm giving it a - overall. I would of given it a - if isn't for the complete feel the ending give me. I would of given it much highier if the journey was longer allowing deeper character development and more interesting interactions to happen. And, if the story was more better telled and explained other than just somewhat of in the form of a information dump. Some characters, especially - in my mind would of really enjoyed more development in their character to make them feel less like just an tag along in the team for me. 
Edit: After thinking about it more, I changed my mind and decided to increase my review from - to -

I was dissapointed. My friends told me that it was the most gory anime they've seen. I've seen shojo animes far worse than this! Overall to be honest, it actually has a very interesting story to it, it's not that bad. It's very suspenceful, and you just HAVE to know why she does all these things! O just didn't enjoy it because I was expecting more on the violence because I'm screwed up like that. When you watch the Walking Dead, your not scared of ANYTHING!

Cardcaptor Sakura is probably the most underrated anime I have come across since ----. People tend to misjudge the anime for being a happy-go-lucky magical girl anime. Well, this show is definitely more than it sounds and here's why: 
Story: The story development for this anime was really great, even though the latter part seemed to be a bit repetitive, the overall storyline did well. Cardcaptor Sakura starts off slow, and then gets fun filled until you reach the latter half, where things begin to get emotional. This is a -- episode long anime after all, but I assure you the story does not go down hill once. 
Characters: Oh man. The characters were really something else. Firstly our protagonist, Sakura Kinomoto, was a gem. She has a sweet personality, she cares more for others than just herself and she handles hard situations extremely well. She has a mature attitude, and by that I don't necessarily mean that she's serious and heavy hearted, but she's earnest. Our second protagonist, which is Syaoran, is also great. He is a bit stubborn in the beginning but his feelings for Sakura gradually builds up as the anime goes on. Sakura's best friend, Tomoyo, has a calm personality and even though she does not have magical powers herself, she is an essential character in the anime, because with her, she and Syaoran and Sakura are like the three musketeers. Their friendship is strong from start to finish. 
Art: The art of this show was beautiful. Even for an older anime made in ----, the art blends in well with the tone of the story and the background art also blends in with the characters. This will surely prove you that you don't have to underestimate old anime. 
Sound: The music, damn, the music. It gives away the feel of an ocean or that feeling when you look at the sea and watch the waves. The music is smooth and adds a heartwarming feel to the anime. The openings and endings were also both great. 
Enjoyment: By now you probably want to know if this anime is enjoyable or not. Well, it is. This is a anime with great character development, story development and the ending was really heart-felt. I enjoyed this show a lot, right up until the end.  
Overall: Cardcaptor Sakura is amazing, do not underestimate it and I definitely reccomend this to people who wants to see an older anime and for people who wants to break away from the hardcore action, blood and gore for a while. Just check it out and see for yourself.

This is just a complete disappointment.  
I really loved the old anime. I loved the aesthetics, the creepy scenery, the overall dark tone, the seiyuu, the art style, the soundtrack and the pace. And a lot more.  
That's why I was also really hyped up for Hallow... but that was just an extreme disappointment. 
The pace and the art style are one of the worst things. I also don't like the color palette and the seiyuus that were chosen for Hallow. Why does Hallow look so cheerful and happy when it's the exact opposite?  
The expression were horrible too. They looked fake and forced and most of them didn't even remotely look like they did in the manga. A profressional should know how to draw proper expressions.  
I want to be happy that they did a sequel, but I can't. Not with something like this.  
I love D. Gray-Man with my entire being, but Hallow felt like an insult towards D. Gray-Man and Hoshino herself. Allen was protrayed totally different in Hallow - I was very butthurt by that, since Allen is my absolute favorite. 
Especially after the horrible poster I lost ALL my respect for this studio. This incident made even Hoshino upset. I'm sure some of you know what I'm referring to.  
However, some shots (mostly scenery) in Hallow were good, only some though. It was very inconsistent and the anatomy was kind of weird.  
I'm sorry if this review comes off as rude, but I can't bring myself to write any positive things of Hallow. There aren't many I can think of either. I'm sorry.

this anime is about a -- year old boy called Yukio Tanaka (Koyuki) who is already feeling tired of life and finds his way back to loving life after he immerses him self in music after meeting a mysterious man called Ryusuke Minami and an evan more mysterious dog called beck and eventually joins a band called beck 
I found the story to be a nine out of ten as I really felt it shows the true struggle of a rock band trying to make it in the music business. It really focuses on  becks struggle for success but it also has some romantic aspects which dose not take over the story (for a change) 
The animation got a eight out of ten because though it is quite an old anime it dose really well considering. It also got this score by the animation of the band members playing the instruments as it really captures a real musicians moments and stage and actual instruments 
The sound gets a solid ten out of ten as it produces top class music that i still go back and listen to.Another reason it has a strong ten as it fully captures what is truly like as fans and performers at concerts and gigs  
the characters get a nine out of ten  because it shows that a particularly normal and bland character like Koyuki can find a passion in music and in any thing else for that matter and shows that you don't have to stay ""normal"". It also shows a musicians true passion for music through the other band members of beck 
The voice acting was also good and fluid but i preferred the dub version evan though i usually hate the dub re-makes   
I hope you will give it a watch and like it as much as i did

It sucks, to be left hanging... 
NANA is fantastic. Great story with great artwork and even great music. The characters are colourful and I find myself being able to relate to every single one of them. The reason for this is because each of them have more than a handful of flaws. Nana Osaki is possesive, Hachi is weak-willed and an idealist, Takumi has little compassion and does not know how to show his feelings, etc. This anime/manga really should be labelled as ""awfully tragic"" It made me feel emotions I didn't think we're possible while watching/reading it.  
Anyways as we will probably never solve the dozens of mysteries Ai Yazawa has woven into this masterpiece, all we can do is speculate and read a little fan fiction here and there :)  
Question:who do you think are Ren Ichinose's parents?

Your Name ""Kimi no Na wa"" is a showcase of how you can make a masterpiece while focusing on the pure essentials. With the exception of the masterful visuals, almost everything simply exists to complement the work; the soundtrack isn't overpowering or notable, the characters are limited and basic, and the story is far from being complex or even original (see ""The Lakehouse"").  
This essentialist approach accomplishes the goal having the entire moving being focused on the getting the audience to be emotionally invested, not in the story, or characters themselves, but the thread that connects Mitsuha and Taki through space and time. A thread that in turn also connects with our own hearts.

Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what anime is among the most romantic of them all? Could it be one where the protagonist is a girl with hair the color of apples, and she falls in love with the second prince of a country that is not her own? Oh my, I'd say that's very romantic! How could I have encountered it other than it being among the July ---- anime I missed out on and deeply regret doing so? More importantly, now that I've watched it, what do I think of it? 
Well, you shall find out by reading my review of season one of Snow White with the Red Hair, known in Japanese as Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. 
Snow White with the Red Hair follows a girl named Shirayuki (meaning snow white), who is an herbalist with bright red hair. She ends up catching the attention of Prince Raji, the prince of her country of Tanbarun, and he tries to make her his concubine. Shirayuki responds by cutting her hair and escapes to the neighboring country of Clarines. She ends up meeting the second prince of Clarines, Zen, and his two aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki, and she ends up being saved from Prince Raji by them. It is then that Shirayuki decides to become a court herbalist for Clarines. As Shirayuki aims for a new life in Clarines and Zen tries to become a worthy prince, they support each other, and a romance blossoms between the two. 
I should start by saying the animation is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. Bones has done great animation before, like in Space Dandy, Noragami, Ouran High School Host Club, and more, but the animation in Snow White with the Red Hair is definitely up there with the best. I've fallen completely in love with the opening theme, ""Yasashii Kibou"" by Saori Hayami, and the ending theme, ""Kizuna ni Nosete"" by eyelis, is a very good song, too. I watched this anime's English dub, and I'd say that Funimation has nailed yet another dub. The voice actors had performed very well, especially Brina Palencia as Shirayuki and Josh Grelle as Prince Zen. 
The story was quite an easygoing one, but it definitely provided a lot of character development. Speaking of characters, this anime had a lot of great characters. Shirayuki is a strong protagonist, and it's admirable how she always works hard. Zen is equally as likable, if not more; it's clear that he really cares about Clarines and its people. I honestly didn't know how to think of Obi, who works for Zen, at first, but I eventually grew to like him. There are also a lot of interesting side characters, but I think the side character that stood out to me the most was Mitsuhide; I really liked his friendship with Zen. 
What could be the best part about this anime, though? Well, it doesn't take a detective to figure out that I'm talking about the romance between Shirayuki and Zen! They had a very strong bond as friends, but whenever they would have those tender, romantic moments, I just can't help but smile. This is probably going to be a bit of a spoiler, but the best part is that they actually confess their feelings for each other instead of letting it drag on for too long! ....Okay, I lied; it was very late in the season when they confessed. Hey, thank God for the currently-airing-at-the-time-of-this-review season two, right? This means we'll actually get to see them as a couple, albeit in a different season. 
Overall, Snow White with the Red Hair is off to a fantastic start. I'd recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a great romance anime. Be warned, though, not to bite into the apple that makes you think it's anything like the fairy tale ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", because although there are two references in the first episode, it's poison not to think of it as anything less of its own story.

I decided to do a quick review of an anime I dropped, please note I haven't seen all of the episodes or played the games, but I'm sure I have a basic understanding.  
Story (-) - An attorney getting clues and defending someone? Sounds, great honestly. I would give it an - but, the execution is god awful. It's nothing more then a being mess with no attempts for jokes or character development, it's more of a thing that happened then the characters just move on. They forget about that the next episode. 
Art (-) - I love is art style of a video game, but that's the only good thing about it. The art can be awkward and still at times that I wish I could look away but I can't then I'm stuck with a headache. Sometimes the animation looks odd as well, like in the opening. 
Sound (-) - Easily the best part about this show, the voice actors and actresses do an amazing job on there parts. Listening to the opening and closing of each episode is the best part of each episode. They don't sound grading to the ears! It sounds like effort has been put into them! 
Character (-) - Uh... who are these people? The characters in this show are so, boring. It makes each episode go for longer and longer. Mr. Attorney Can't Remember His Real Name Man is the blandest and the most forgettable of them all, at least the other characters seem cool and heck maybe even OKAY but since THIS guy is our main character we have to follow him around and hope he does something another then some random stuff that's ends up working in the end. 
Enjoyment (-) 
Overall (-) - If you're drink and bored, THEN watch this anime but if you aren't both of those things kindly run away from this monsterpiece of a show.

I know we’ve all made fun of light novel names over the years, but I don’t think anyone could have figured that one of the very few short ones would end up being the most reliable goldmine in terms of naming humor in quite a while. Within an hour of its airing, most people I pay attention to kept making hilari-dumb tweets such as “dropping Heavy Object because I don’t even lift” and “not even bothering to pick Heavy Object up because it looks too big for me”, and it never ceased to be funny. One wonders why we didn’t come up with this joke before airing considering how obvious it is in retrospect. Guess we were too busy looking at the girls’ massive bosoms and connecting the unfortunate name to them. 
Now I’m a guy who’ll watch anything as long as it looks interesting, regardless of quality. And in Heavy Object’s case, I picked it up solely for the opportunity to exploit its name because I’m not mature enough to let such a childish goldmine slide past me. Unfortunately, it’s been more than six months since the show’s initial airing and by now, every other person who was also stupid enough to stick with this show has dug up every fleck of yellow sparkle in the thing, leaving me with little fresh material. As such, the only way I can proceed forward with my intended goal in regards to this awful anime is to put on a straight face and use these name-jokes ironically by pointing out its overuse and then using them anyways. Already did the first part and I’m going to proceed with the second, so let’s start right now by saying Heavy Object is truth in advertising because it’s a pretty heavy anime alright. Heavy in bullshit that is! 
Heavy Object comes to us from the creators of Index/Railgun, which I don't remember a thing about aside from Touma punching nuns, so I couldn't tell you how it compares to them other than the fact that the production values are toilet-tier with or without comparison. It's full of horrible production choices, from the cheap-ass CG explosions to the character designs being plainer than a rocking chair in a nursery home. The main characters are pretty bland as well. Qwenthur Barbotage and Havia Winchell are two male soldiers who received recognition for doing the impossible and destroying an elite war machine called an Object with their own ingenuity aka dumb luck and plot convenience. This causes people to realize that Objects are less effective than Metal Gears in terms of invincibility and as such, the duo are sent on a string of dangerous missions by their commanding officers hoping that lightning can strike twice. Because this is a two-cour show based on an ongoing light novel series with no end in sight, the lightning strikes about five times throughout Heavy Object's run, each time more contrived than the last. But considering the situations are in of themselves contrived, it all balances out I guess. 
The problem with our leads is that they have as much charisma as Pauly Shore and Steven Baldwin from Biodome. Everything that happens to them is completely situational, and when they're not doing their soldier duty, they're either reading porno mags or groping their superior officers. Not that it helps that said superior dresses like a stripper trying to pose as an officer, and the camera takes every opportunity to pan all over her own ""heavy objects"" even when she's on the battlefield. But I feel something has gone horribly wrong when the only thing you can remember about each arc after it's finished is what fetish the writer crowbarred in this time. There's also this little girl named Milinda who is pretty much the opposite in terms of fetish design, but if you think this show is above what looks to be a little girl taking every opportunity to strip down, then you don't know JC Staff. And no, none of the females are any better than our male leads in terms of likability. They're just not stupid enough to the point that you'd want to punch them, then drill holes in their heads before turning it on yourself. 
As is usual for what passes for writing in light novel world, Heavy Object is a load of heavy plot without any actual story to support viewers when they pick it up. There are several episodes - usually at the start of a new arc - that consist of nothing but exposition and the male leads trying to import some foreign porn. Not exactly something that I want to carry around, is it? And the missions themselves are completely throwaway, not amounting to anything but visual junk food that never changes that status quo and isn't even exciting to watch due to the horrible direction and the obviously pandering fetish fuel. None of the military stuff even remotely resembles real life, and if this is supposed to be a satire regarding the future of government weapons, whatever it's trying to say about them is completely lost on me. At one point, the characters run into a military unit consisting of nothing but female soldiers dressed in maid uniforms for a reason that I honestly can't remember and refuse to look up because the outfits are never relevant to the plot and neither are those soldiers for that matter. We all know the only reason it exists was just so that we could have maid fanservice in this anime, so really who cares? And it's the fact that no one does that exemplifies just how completely pointless anything that happens in Heavy Object is. 
Speaking of female soldiers, there sure are a lot of them holding important positions in a primarily male-dominated profession, aren't there? Every single arc seems to have at least one new girl for the characters to interact with, and I can't remember a single important supporting cast member with a Y chromosome that didn't look like he belonged right at home in an NTR hentai. You could say it's a progressive choice, but given how most of the females have to be supported by men who aren't exactly General Patton in terms of intimidating in order to do anything, along with the fact that I don't exactly see the males wearing uniforms with their chests hanging out, you'd have a hard time convincing me or --% of the human population that that is true. It's just bland, light novel, reverse feminism bullshit of giving the females powerful positions and removing what made them so powerful in the first place to the point that you might as well have not bothered. 
And that's what Heavy Bullshit is at the end of the day. Bland. Invisible. Toothless. Castrated. Completely fucking stupid. So full of nothing but heavy crap that made my thinking muscles sore after holding onto it for so long. There's no story, there's no character development, there's no overall progression, and the production is so lazy it makes a Snorlax look energetic. My advice to you? Don't even bother picking it up. There are much better ways to work out that don't involve the risk of dropping a heavy object right on your foot and causing permanent damage.

--- Warning: Contains spoilers --- 
Stories of people with superhuman abilities have been around practically since the dawn of time. Ever since DBZ set the bar for “power levels” consisting of blowing up planets however, more and more modern series have teetered on the edge of colossal scales at some point or another. Then you have Darker than Black, which can stand out among a handful of those with more reasonable (or rather comprehensible) scales in the post DBZ era.  
Darker than Black starts out by introducing these things known as contractors, people with special abilities like many series out there, who must pay a “price” for using their power ranging from things like writing poetry to breaking a few fingers. Aside from contractors we have dolls, which are basically emotionless mediums with no real personality, who send out things known as “observer spirits” that work like mobile security cameras. 
We quickly meet our main character Hei, a contractor with electric abilities who seemingly has no price unlike the other contractors out there. Working with a doll named Yin, a talking cat named Mao, and a man named Huang who seems like your typical ----s mafia average joe, the group takes on missions from an organization simply referred to as “The Syndicate”. This organization is apparently vast in scope, as it easily networks Hei into a variety of odd jobs necessary to gather intelligence and work his missions, even in the midst of organizations with top notch security.  
For the first half of the series, we actually don’t learn much about this group, but rather we uncover a variety of characters, their motives, and their back stories as Hei goes on various missions. Although these are well done and quite gruesome visually at times, none of these really seem to be tied together or have importance beyond just another day at the office, making the series fairly episodic in the beginning for the most part. 
The arcs in Darker than Black generally tend to consist of two parts, mostly pertaining to “Hell’s Gate”, a wall around a supernatural zone that appeared some ten years ago in Tokyo as the stars in the night sky were replaced with those representing the lives of contractors. Unless you like unstable realities that laugh in the face of physics and induce mass hysteria, this probably isn’t the type of area you would like to stroll through on a Sunday afternoon.  
It’s easy to see from the beginning, that there is a feeling akin to that of a mafia series. Everything from the way Huang obtains information to Hei’s execution of missions to the way the group explains their relationship with each other fits the bill for a futuristic mafia. As such, they keep their profile as low as they can manage while avoiding failures that may make them live out their usefulness to The Syndicate. Of course, this means you will also get your fair share of enjoyable action as the group carries out The Syndicate’s dirty work.  
Perhaps one of Darker than Black’s most refreshing attributes though is the protagonist Hei. While not particularly rare, Hei is strong but not overpowered. Many modern series have protagonists that are simply too strong in comparison to the antagonists, leaving for boring lackluster fights as they easily beat their opponent. Hei is realistic on the other hand, and many times throughout the series the help of an ally saves him instead of his own strength. For those of you who prefer the ridiculously strong heroes, you might see this as a weakness on his part, but I quite enjoyed giving importance to what has become the oft forgotten role of “right hand man” in today’s lineup of do it yourself heroes. 
Unlike most protagonists though, Hei is rather silent. When he talks, it’s usually only a brief response to another character consisting of maybe a few lines. Compared to other protagonists out there that are always shooting their mouths off and the like, it’s nice to see one speak more through actions than words for once. Sometimes though, this does leave Hei taking a backseat for supporting characters as they become the central focus. In hindsight this is primarily seen in the beginning arcs, but this may end up making it difficult for some people to form a strong enough attachment to the series to see it out to the end when there is more focus and clarity on our main character.  
Despite his rather limited dialogue, Hei still clearly develops as a character. Initially seeming nothing more than the stoic murderer contractors are pegged for completed by his feared moniker “The Black Reaper”, we see that this is only to maintain appearances for his job. It’s not really until the second half of the series that we get to see this other side of Hei, notably when Yin becomes a target for their enemies. When The Syndicate deems Yin possibly harmful to their interests, they order Hei’s group to kill her, to which he defies the order and saves her instead. More difficult orders come down from above as time goes on, and Hei becomes increasingly defiant as he comes to his own realizations of the path he wants to pursue.  
This arc also introduces the growing relationship between Hei and Yin, and despite that both are about as conversational as a rock, they do gradually grow fonder of each over time in their limited communications. Their relationship reminded me much of Roger and Dorothy from Big O, though definitely more realistic considering Yin is actually human unlike Dorothy. It is important to note they don’t always clearly communicate through language, as Yin simply sending out an observer spirit into the gate to check on Hei during one arc clearly meant a lot to him, and it is later noted that this is actually quite painful for a doll to do. Even by the end however, this relationship is still really only a stern fondness. Some audiences may be left unsatisfied that more development wasn’t given here while others may feel that there wasn’t enough directness in their relationship to make for a convincing enough development. 
Around the same time as Yin’s arc, the main and only real plot of Darker than Black begins to emerge with the appearance of a character named Amber. Amber is a contractor codenamed “February”, who apparently betrayed Hei as a member of his group, which also happened to include his sister Pai, in a South American War over a similar zone to Hell’s Gate named “Heaven’s Gate”. Spearheading a group of contractors by the name of Evening Primrose, Amber begins bombing the town and making a nightmare of Hei’s life like a bad ex-girlfriend when she also kidnaps Yin. Don’t forget she leaves behind the courtesy “FU” letter written in that girly handwriting complete with the little hearts and all. 
The story here actually bridges a lot of elements from the beginning arcs together, in a way that makes you realize that while it had the kick back feeling of an episodic series initially, they were conveniently busy weaving the main plot underneath many of these stories unbeknownst to the audience. The realization at the end in how these stories connect to one another is quite a nice touch, but not to the level of being spectacular at the same time. 
By the end, Amber eventually exposes the truth of the Syndicate and the nature of contractors to Hei, and it is then we really see him as the ideal hero.  Hei struggles with the hard moral choices and his limitations as an individual that are in ways reminiscent of heroes like Batman. His final decision on how to resolve the ending conflict speaks strongly towards justice, as he makes the world his enemy to do what he feels is right despite concerns from Amber.  
Abandoning everything he had previously known except Yin, Hei moves forward with his choice to try and get humans and contractors to coexist. Previously having been kicked from the Syndicate, the ending is left rather open with the implication he will begin a whole new life as the Syndicate hunts him down to no end. In many senses, Hei’s journey is only beginning and this series is a prequel to setting that event in motion. While many people prefer their definitive endings, I felt it was rather fitting for the series to leave the ending open instead of attempting an abrupt halt to the nice developments the series brought forth just to manage a definitive end. 
Top the series off with a fitting OST and fluid combat scenes, and Darker than Black becomes a very enjoyable action series definitely worth the watch. The characters were all explained nicely by the end with their developments, even a majority of the supporting cast. Overall this series is best summed up as a “Chinese Electric Batman”, which as it sounds, is just plain awesome.

The show of it's season that everybody likes despite it's pretty bad. We have a group of teens who gets into a world based on RPG ruleset and shortly after this, they forget their previous life... and that's all. We won't get to know who they are, why did they get there, what is that place anyways, why does it operates like a video game, what should they do there. They just live their everyday life, learning some new skills, killing the low level creatures for the loot which they use to cover their living expenses and equipment. 
There are some conflict, they lose a teammate, hire a new one who lost her team and slowly move on after their loss, but this doesn't start a real character improvement. It's trying, but doesn't goes anywhere. During their fights, because of this is a team, we might expect it'll be shown from a strategic point of view. They build up the tactics of their ambushes, comment how the teammates use their class' special skills to effectively operate as a team, but no. They just show their newly learnt skills without any deeper concept. We could think that after these they focus on giving the world some depth, who are these goblins and kobolds, are there any relation between them, what kind of society do they live in, why must they fight with them, why are they hostile by nature, by the way what kind of society do humanity live in this world. But no, we wont get to know anything about these either. The main issue with this show is NOT the slow pacing. The slow pacing can not be an excuse for the lack of world building and plot improvement. At the end there were some improvement in the representation of characters and the fight choreography, then, SLIGHT SPOILER, it ended with a terrible plot armor execution, END SPOILER. 
The art design is correct. The character design follows the typical A- Pictures design. One of the main characters looks exactly like a brown haired Kirito. Not quite unique. The environment and backgrounds are a bit better. With this sketchy looking, hand drawn like appearance it's easily distinguishable from the other series of the studio. It's a matter of taste if you like it or not, I found it a bit self-serving, but a creative way to work with low budget, the main issue isn't this. The animation seems really cheap. The fight scenes are dull, there isn't any tension in them at all. It's nowhere near UBW or even SAO. Oh, and SAO, do you all remember the fight against the first boss with Asuna and Kirito? It was a good fight, they were working together, they looked like a team. I'm not an SAO fan, but that scene was alright in concept and visuality. Don't expect anything even remotely like that from Grimgar. 
To summarize, when I've seen the first promotional image, I knew I have to have low expectations. And thus fortunately or more like sadly I couldn't get disappointed. Not even pleasantly though. It sticks out downwards from average quality. Maybe the light novel was decent, I didn't read it, but there never were a moment when I felt the anime could be any better than a mediocre fantasy shounen. You won't lose anything if you skip it.

Naruto Shippuden is the long awaited sequel of Naruto. Naruto is a good anime that's  why it's no wonder why it became so popular,however Naruto Shippuden  ruined it. 
Story: -/-- 
Naruto Shippuden started off really good, at least it didn't failed everyone's expectation after the long wait. It was nice to see Naruto and the rest grew up as teenagers -with their new missions and new journey. However... as the series continue, the story started to get messed up and slowly went downhill. The story started to focus more on Naruto and Sasuke's relationship - on how Naruto wanted to keep his promise to Sakura and bring Sasuke back. The fights took so long, not because a fierce fight was going on but because of the long talks during the fight. 
Art: -/-- 
The characters doesn't look as good as before. The animation is also really bad, it looks so dull. There were fight scenes that could've been great to watch, but because of bad animation, it became boring to watch. There are also times when the characters look distorted -especially during fight scenes. 
Character: -/-- 
Nothing much has change from the characters...except: 
Some old characters that we thought of as cool ended up doing nothing really helpful and ended up like side characters. 
There are new interesting characters but the attention for them slowly fade. 
The are lots of characters that wasn't given the attention and development that they deserve. 
Overall: -/-- 
It is really sad... how a good series ended up being disappointing

This is meant to be a fair preview of NHK’s ---- children’s anime “Pingu in the City.” 
In this preview, I aim to provide credible information regarding this anime to those who might look into this show no further than reading the reviews on this page.  
Story -/--:  
As the newest season of a mainly episodic series with little to no overarching plot, Pingu in the City is by no means groundbreaking. With that being said, the - episodes of this season that have aired are far from bad. The stories are predictable and follow traditional themes of children’s storytelling, but there is a uniting theme of “work” at the core of every episode. This can be broken up into sub-themes such as (but not limited to): helping, responsibility, and making the most of an unsavory situation. One positive aspect of the Pingu series that lends itself towards effective storytelling is its gibberish dialogue, which cuts out almost all exposition. At only seven minutes per episode, there is little to complain about here. For a children’s show, “Pingu in the City” is fantastic, but when compared with something intended for an older audience, the story of this show will obviously come-of as nubile and generic.  
Art -/--:  
Despite the switch from the claymation of previous seasons to the computer-animation of this one, the art style of the Pingu series has always been good. The simplistic character designs of the previous seasons are still around, only now, their forms are a tad more consistent. The splendid texture work on the characters, objects, and buildings makes for a very convincing replication of original show’s soft clay aesthetic. While not exactly inventive, the shot composition is very nice, and the lighting looks quite realistic. Despite the constant technological advancements that are made regarding the visual fidelity of CG, the lighting and textures in this show cannot match the real shadows and actual clay of the claymated original. One benefit of the switch to CG is the spike in animation fluidity and consistency, making “action” scenes more convincing. If “Pingu in the City” was claymated like the original, while also using the artistic technique on display in these past six episodes, I’d give it a --/-- in this category. Even though this is not the case, I feel that an -/-- is a valid score for how well they were able to replicate the charming claymation of the original using a digital medium.  
Sound -/--: 
One of the Pingu series’ main appeals is its gibberish dialogue, and in “Pingu in the City” this is still the case. The voice actors flesh out the characters quite well, even though the words they’re speaking have no specific meaning. The OP and ED are short, cheery, and pleasing to the ear. The sound effects serve their intended purposes very well; I personally found the slapping sounds that accompany the movement of feet and flippers to be very cute. The background instrumentals are relaxing, and the overall soundtrack seems to be filled with a wide expanse of different songs that fit the tone of every scene in which they are used.  
Characters -/--:  
The characters presented so far are serviceable, but the only one with a discernable name is the main character, Pingu. After minimal research, I found out that there are only -- other named characters in the series, including “Papa,” “Mama,” and his sister, Pinga. One might take this as a bad sign, but for the sake of this show’s interests, names aren’t really needed. Traditional family stereotypes tell us who Pingu’s mother is and who Pingu’s father is; there is no need to for exposition. So far, the only one of these characters with ample screen time has been Pingu. As a mostly episodic anime, there doesn’t seem to be any significant character growth or deterioration from episode to episode. At the end of episode - however, Pingu seems to have grown into a more responsible person, so there is the possibility that his character will change with time.  
Enjoyment -/--: 
I’ve enjoyed this anime far more than I had originally expected, which is why I’ve written such a dead serious review; I want to give an honest opinion for those who are drowning in this sea of memes. Pingu in the City makes for a satisfying weekly reprieve from the more violent and depressing anime that I usually consume. With -- episodes at only - minutes an episode, this anime is easily consumable and doesn’t demand the commitment that a normal anime might demand in order to get anything out of it. The hypersexual, overly violent, and needlessly cutesy aspects of modern anime which usually drive people away from this medium are not present here. I can say with certainty that this show is for everyone.  
Overall Rating: -/-- 
Despite the lengths to which I have gone for the sake of this show, I am not an avid fan Pengu. I’ve only seen a few episodes of the original seasons, and that was only for the sake of comparison in this review. I’m just a guy who saw a charming, fun show being overtaken by a meme, and felt the need to do right by said show. 
In deeming this a preview, this review will most likely be removed upon this series’ completion, and I’m ok with that; I can write a full review when that day arrives.

Serial Experiments Lain is easily one of the most mind-bending anime I have seen to date. Do not watch Serial Experiments Lain if you need everything to make sense. From episode one all the way to the end you feel as if you are wading through a fog alongside the main character searching for it's meaning. It does progress and hopefully you'll be able to pick out enough information from the events that take place to continually take the next step forward, as the completion of this anime is, though complicated, extremely rewarding to those with enough of an open mind. The amount of confusion versus the amount of story progression teetered on a delicate balance for the first couple episodes which brings the score down a fair amount, but I will reassure you that the story truly is a unique and worthwhile experience if you are willing to take a journey through murky fog to find the light at the other side. 
Art - - 
The artwork in Serial Experiments Lain at first seemed simple (almost bad) using color schemes that were pale (like pastels) and garish (lots of one color and the focus being almost completely opposite). But after a while you'll realize that the color schemes in this anime are totally appropriate for the entire mood and vibe of the anime. Again, do not watch this anime if you don't have an open mind. The artwork is not nearly as shiny and fresh as most animes out there. So keeping in mind that the artwork is nothing exciting and almost drab, save for a few intense sequences, but does a marvelous job of conveying the vibe of the story I will give it a score of -. 
Sound - - 
Another well used tool of conveying a particular mood, the sounds in Serial Experiments Lain are just as mysterious and haunting as the rest of the anime. White noise type sounds are raised to a pitch that you definately notice, and convey a sense of connection to the world being shown to you. And the opening them fits perfectly and is a real good listen. Good enough in fact that a full version of the song is in my library and plays randomly. The noises can  be somewhat distracting in their own way and take a little too much of your attention then they should so the sound score loses - points for a score of - 
Character - - 
It is kinda hard for me to come up with an accurate score of the characters which brings the score down a few points alone. The characters not being solid enough to get a clear feeling of  is deserving of a few point penalty. Even though I was quite attached to Lain and Arisu almost all the other characters showed little to no development from their initial appearance. Score for the characters is only a -. 
Enjoyment - - 
Mysterious, thought provoking, and strangely fascinating, despite several flaws, makes this a very enjoyable assuming you are in the right mood. My thoughts were to give this anime a full -- when i finished it but it takes a penalty just for having as many other penalties as it already does. 
Overall - - 
I truly liked this anime a bit more then the score represents, but this anime takes a hit or two due to its extremely unique and confusing nature. But I do completely and totally recommend watching this anime to anyone with a tolerance for mind bending sequences.

Senki Zesshou Symphogear is an odd musical, action anime featuring girls in colorful sci-fi battle suits who must fight against monsters called ""Noise"" in order to save humanity. In order to use the relics that power their Symphogear suits, the girls must sing certain songs. The different songs they sing give them different powers ranging from charging up their suit to unleashing their strongest attack which has a recoil effect on them when used. 
Despite a visually promising concert scene in the beginning of the first episode, the story falls to pieces almost immediately. It seems almost as if the organization working with the Symphogear girls expected the Noise to attack the concert where the girls were singing in order to revive a powerful relic. So why risk the lives of thousands of eager concert-goers who get caught in the fray when the Noise do show up? This may seem like a minor plot problem (aside from the hundreds of carbonized dead bodies), but similar plot issues like this build up after a while and become difficult to ignore. The two girls, Kanade and Tsubasa, who had been performing then change their songs and begin fighting the Noise in order to save the frantic mass of people who are all scrambling for the exits. However, our main protagonist, Hibiki, gets trapped while trying to get away and ends up getting injured despite the singers' efforts to save her. Since mentioning some things that happen in the first episode would be a spoiler, I'll stop the initial summary there. 
There are many more problems with the story, but most of them occur with several sudden changes in characters' personalities in addition to the nonsensical ending. The characters in this show get over their anger at others in the most illogical ways ranging from having someone clean their room to just deciding out of nowhere that they should be friends again. The Swan Songs (which are the girls' ultimate attacks) also deal less and less of a self-damaging recoil every time they occur in the anime for some unexplained reason. 
As for the characters themselves, they are hardly unique at all. Hibiki is basically a weaker and more annoying version of Kaname Madoka who accepts her power a bit faster (they are also both voiced by Aoi Yuki). As for the other main characters, they are a girl who likes to fight alone and dislikes Hibiki for reasons in their past and a tsuntsun girl who has a hard time understanding other people's perspectives of the world. The villain is just an annoying sadist who enjoys being nude and has no appeal aside from her excellent voice actor (who still couldn't save her from being annoying). 
Being an anime with a heavy focus on music, you would expect a great soundtrack. While this is the strongest category, it's only barely above average. For much of the earlier episodes, the music plays almost non-stop switching from track to track with hardly any break. It got to the point where I was grateful for some of the scenes later on when they finally paused the soundtrack for part of a scene. None of the tracks stood out much either aside from one hard rock track that was used to accompany Yukine's fights. Much of the rest of the music consists of the j-pop/techno combinations used for both the songs sung by the characters' as well as the background music. There were also some problems with the volume of the music/singing when used while characters were speaking at times. 
Oh, and this anime has some of the worst Engrish I've ever heard to the point where the subbers provided subs for it and even fixed the grammar at some points to make it more understandable. 
The animation is the most inconsistent category. It looks like a quarter of the entire animation budget for this show was used during the two concert scenes. Compared to these scenes (especially around episode - and -) the animation takes a nosedive. That's not to say it's all bad aside from those two scenes, however there are some moments where a single motionless shot will stay for almost twenty seconds or the animation just looks like a couple gifs pasted on top of each other. There is also one scene where a character is looking down out of a library window and sees two characters in a hospital room, but when you see out of the window from the hospital room, there is no library (or any buildings at all) in sight. Similarly to Evangelion, this anime also reuses the same shots of the main organization's headquarters many times.

The many faults in this series build up over time and prevent it from being very enjoyable. It's uncreative premise of saving the world from mysterious creatures which has been done much better hundreds of times doesn't allow for much right from the start. The bland characters, mediocre soundtrack despite being a music anime, and the inconsistent animation don't do much to save it either. I recommend skipping this anime and watching something like Gurren Lagann, Evangelion, or Madoka Magica if you want something similar but much better.

Golden Time is the most recent anime I have seen as of writing this review. I went into the series hoping to experience the same sense of endeavour that I did with its predecessor Toradora, unfortunately I was disappointed. That being said, this isn't a bad anime series, if we look at it from a stand alone perspective without reference to Toradora this series isn't half bad. 
Golden Time follows a boy named Tada Banri who is currently attending college, due to later conceived circumstances we found out that he had recently suffered a case of amnesia that lead him to forget everything after his final year of High School. Whilst adjusting to his new life, a girl named Kaga Kouka is introduced who brings with her a plot of drama and romance. 
Pros 
So yeah I didn't quite enjoy this series as much as I expected to, my main problem lies within a certain portion of the show but I'll get to that later. I'll start of with what I liked about the series, the characters for one, the series does an amazing job with the handling of each character. Every character feels like a genuinely real person, all with their own traits and flaws, if you don't like one character theres gonna be another one that you'll certainly enjoy. *Has -D flashbacks* Another aspect of the show I enjoyed was the writing (well, at least in the beginning) there are a lot of heart felt moments that can be accredited to the writers of the series, much of the dialogue, especially the lines delivered by Tada Banri, can really tug at the heart strings at times.  
Cons 
Alright those were the things I enjoyed about the show, I won't mention the things I didn't mind about the show such as the animation or music because I don't really have an opinion on them, they were just meh. Instead I'll just focus on the pros and cons, as these are the parts of the show that grasped my attention and actually made me give a second thought about. So as I mentioned before I have an underlying problem with this show, and this has the do with the latter half of the series. After episode - the series enters a decline as it introduces many other unneeded elements into the story such as evil spirits and love triangles. I would have to say that episode - of the series is the best it has to offer, I loved that episode from start to finish and I especially enjoyed how it ended. I honestly believe that if they ended it at the -th episode I would have been more satisfied. It would have obviously been an incomplete anime but nevertheless I would have enjoyed it more and would be able to come to terms with the ending. The ending of the series is terrible, it is very short sighted and you can tell that the series creators needed to quickly end it before they blew their budget, the show needed more time to further elaborate on the resolve of this series because it kind of just... ends. Another problem I have with this series is its 'humour', I didn't find much of it funny as a lot of it was very forced and kind of interjected into casual scenes. There are some scenes that you may find funny here and there but it's nothing gut wrenching. 
Conclusion 
So did I like this series?... eh kind of. I certainly enjoyed the first - episodes but the rest of it is kind of a let down. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad anime, it just has a lot of pacing issues but don't let that turn you away from this series, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had out of it.

You find out cool interesting stuff at somewhere and tries hard for get better on that thing. You may find only ur own growths and fall in that and become best. But time passes... others may exceeds ur ass. Your teammates may hesitate ur skill. Later they kick out and ban you... This is what this story starts. This is story about ""comeback"".  
Story was good but in this season they hided a lot. He starts from zero and takes deep breaths. Just does for what he liked. Quanzhi Gaoshou's story is near to reality because it based on novel. That's very very good news.  
There's specials, and second season announced with -- episodes :-. In first season it's just start. I bet in second season story'd explode.  
This anime got very good and cool animations. They worked on it very well. You can here, Chinese animators can do goodies. After i watched this series i thought several years later we''ll watch more different cultured series. 
Op, ed, osts were good. I don't know Chinese language watched it with sub. btw i learned some words. Characters sounds were good. MC's was best. 
I watched this season several times as full. I enjoyed a every single episodes. Those -- episodes were meaningful for story. I really really glad that it based on novel.  
I wanted more story so i gave only - score. They'll explode in season -. 
This anime has worth for watching. I'll highly recommend to watch it.  
See you again at sequels of this series.
